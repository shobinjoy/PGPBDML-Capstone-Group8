First off, the girl on the speaker was super hard to understand. Not because of the speaker, but because of her accent. If you're going to put someone on drive through orders, make sure the people in line can decipher what they're saying.

Second, this place has two drive through lanes. Everyone knows it's supposed to go one lane at a time for ordering. The lane next to me had three cars go through before my order even got taken. 

Third, my order got punched in wrong. When I got to the window to pay, the girl read off my order AS SHE SWIPED MY CARD. So basically I'm stuck with whatever they want to give me at that point. I ordered a nugget combo meal and a chicken club combo meal. When I told the girl the sandwich was wrong (they had a quarter pounder on there), she called back to someone to have it corrected and told me they would give it to me at the next window.

I get to the window and the guy there is basically throwing my food and drinks at me. I asked him if there was a chicken sandwich in the bag and he said yes. Lesson learned - always check the bag. I open it up and find a quarter pounder with bacon - no cheese. Definitely NOT what I ordered. Not to mention that each of my drinks had three (yes, three) cups attached to each other. Maybe if the guy hadn't been throwing my food at me he would have taken the time to only give me one cup. That ought to throw their drink count off tonight.

Will not be back."	2

Minimum wage employees who seem to feel he can not check on a guy's order because he kind of looked homeless?  The bag was sitting on the counter and the poor guy wasn't given a receipt and was hesitant to take the food because he wasn't sure. I asked the cashier what the bag contained and the cashier said from 1' away that he is there and the food is here - like he can't flipping step over 2 steps to see what it is!!?!?  When I game him a ""seriously?"" look, he finally checked on it.  And finally the poor guy had his lunch!  In the mean time my coffee was all forgotten about and I had to ask for it.  
Dear Cashier - there is a reason why you are still a cashier at McDonald's  at age -'probably over 40 -   The place is renovated and cute but they need to upgrade the people that deal w customers!"	0

Both girls window 1 (Pay Here) and window 2 (pick up here) just looked unhappy. No hello, no smile, just misery.
So then I asked the girl at window 2 if the nuggets were fresh, she looked confused so i asked again ... She said she did not know, twice. I was waiting for her to do what is usually done, ask the ppl running the line. She didn't. Instead she laughed and closed the window.
Talk about bad customer service.
I didnt get out my car just because the struggle of a carseat for my son.
I get home to cold, stale nuggets.
At least i got this location out of the way. On to the next."	0

After seeing it so many times on her snapchat, I decided to give it a try. We prefer a #3 and four #5's, the price was reasonable. The lady says it'll be a 20 minute wait, so she parks us on the side. We wait 30minutes, and the chicken was fresh but isn't it common sense if your going to make me wait for chicken you should give me fresh frys and biscuits and mac n cheese? It was all old and dry! Chicken was good but I couldn't enjoy my whole meal. My cousin tells me it's probably just the location, at baseline they always make it fresh! We're a big family so we order a lot. On top of that, the lady forgot to give us forks, napkins, dipping sauce we asked for, and we had a missing drink! The two dr peppers we had were flat, and my other cousin ate her mac n cheese with her hands. I will give Popeyes another chance but never this one! It's probably the worst one in the valley! The thing that sucks the most is im on a strict diet and that was my cheat day, cheat day wasted! I'm not happy..	1

Manager was very rude because they forgot my sauces and I ask for an accommodation because they ALWAYS forget my sauce and I always have to drive all the way back because they forgot something. I asked for a pie or even a small side item. He offered me apple pie but I don't like apple things, and then a biscuit which I didn't want but took because he was rude. I called back to let him know that I did not appreciate his service. He proceeded to yell at me and was like "" What do you want $100?!"" I said no I asked for a side. He continued to yell at me and told me he was not going to argue so I asked for a corporate number. He lied and gave me a corporate number that does not exist 4 times, all different numbers that were not 10 digits. He gave me a9 digit number at first and then 3, 11 digit numbers. He lied about his store number so that I wouldn't contact you guys. I found the number online myself. He also told me it was my fault that they keep forgetting my sauces. The lady even corrected me on the name of the sauces so I know I told her. They always ask me what sauce I want at the drive through and then ALWAYS have to tell them again at the window and they still forget it every time. All I wanted was a side for driving 10 extra miles for their mistake."	0

6	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	1	0	1	Just left here and they're out of everything, how does Popeye's run out of chicken? thats like Subway running out of bread...find another location besides this one.	4
7	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	1	1	Food cold right from the start couldn't turn around because the intersection is f****** ridiculous and I quite honestly don't even want to eat my meal horrible I'm pissed off	2
8	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	1	0	1	Broke ass equipment in the drive through with no notification so we sit there talking to a broken speaker. Had to repeat order four times to the retarded girl running the drive through. I checked the bag by the window and the forgot my biscuits, after telling me it was everything. Had to ask for them. Get home and they stiffed me on amount of chicken tenders. Tenders were 60% hard crusty, macaroni was mediocre and gummy, fries were basic, sweet tea was lukewarm with barely any ice. I can get the same family meal at churches for half the price, this shit meal cost me 40 bucks. Don't forget it's in a ghetto ass Plaza next to a run down food city with scummy looking people in the parking lot. Please, please avoid this utter shit location. I'll never visit a popeyes again.	2

11	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	1	4	1	Giving one star is too much when they really should be getting 0 stars. My coworker and I were just there, and we were waiting in the drive-thru for 25min. Making us late for work. We ended up leaving, and luckily there were no cars behind us or we would of waiting longer. Thanks for making us late for work. We were trying to call their number while we were waiting, and of course nobody would pick up the phone.	3
12	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	1	1	1	Wow this place is gross. Maybe the food might be ok but this is the worst services. The inside was super messy and they were so uncoordinated. People have been waiting for over 30mins to get out food and the staff doesn't knw what order was next and who had what. Just horrible!!!!!!!	2
13	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	3	1	I love Popeyes. Just not this one. Came in ordered 2 kids meals my 3 pice meal and popcorn shrimp for my lady. 3 min later all but the shrimp are ready. We eat and almost done when they bring the so call shrimp. All that wait for this see the photo. Not to mention we asked for the shrimp and the cashier said its almost out. But did not check, the shrimp had been sitting in the warmer for about 2 min before he got it. And told us the shrimp is ready. He did apologize for the wait but still wifey had to eat all by herself.	3

15	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	1	1	"THE WORST!! NEGATIVE RATING! This was the worst experience I have ever had with Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits. I love the food and recently moved to AZ, so I drove 15 miles out of my way to get some of their food. I arrived about 6:30PM on 18 May 2016. I went through the drive thru and placed my order. They said it would take an extra 5 minutes. After parking and waiting 40 minutes, I went inside and asked about my order. There were no customers inside and when I approached the counter, I received no greeting. A slow approaching greasy looking young man approached, said nothing and just nodded as if to say ""what?"". I informed him I had been waiting and asked how much longer it would be. He yelled around the corner to ask about my order, and then came the fire works! A young lady yelled back, ""we didn't make it! He is new Israel, and you are not helping us! You need to help us!""  ( I guess a new person was being trained and the staff was too busy ) Israel then walked around the kitchen, and opened then leaned into the walk-in, grabbing some fish or chicken fingers by his hands and tossing it at the fryer. He never said a word to me--just walked around in a stuper like a zombie. He stood near the back behind the main food prep table barking out orders for more mashed, beans etc. I stood there for about another 5-6 minutes thinking my food was on its way. Then, unprofessional Israel approaches the counter slowly and tells me, ""they didn't make it yet, it will be another 5 minutes or you can have your money back"" It was unbelievable the lack of professionalism I witnessed. I asked for my money back, and 'Israel"" disappeared then returned with a finger smashed wad of bills and coins and plopped it on the counter, turned his back and walked away without saying a word. Fire these people!! I'm shocked to see all the negative ratings this location has!! This is pathetic service!! If I could give a negative rating, I would. This location is a disgrace to the Popeye's franchise! The staff is either on drugs, needs training, supervision, or all of the above based on what I witnessed. Do not give this location your money! They do not deserve to be in business!"	1

While we are looking at the menu (driving thru) he decided to give us a attitude, when my husband said ""ok we are ready!"" He said what do you want? With rude tone of voice. We tried to get some sweets and he said ""we dont have that"" Until we got to the window to pay and grab my chicken. He never ever say thank u or anything. He didnt Even told us how much! when i opened my box it was DRY CHICKEN WITH A SMALL DRUM STICK CHICKEN. He was wearing blue polo shirt so i assume he is the manager if im not wrong. I have never had services like this. Im from japan and i am very very disappointed in america when it comes to costomer service. i will never ever going back to that popeyes. Keep ur moody attitude rudeness to yourself when u are working costomer services."	0

The guy at the register had hickeys all over his neck and had no customer service skills whatsoever. The location was extremely dirty... And when we were eating in the lobby they turned the lights off on us, even though the drive through was still open they continued to rush us out of the door. Other then taking our order, there was no form of customer service ever put in to place.	0
19	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	0	2	I love Popeyes but this location is employed by slow rude people. The food is what you'd expect, but it's annoying when you ALWAYS make you park while you wait 20 mins for your food.  I know they're busy, but it's like every time I go here I have to park & wait.	1
20	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	2	2	1	"**in short: worst service in the history of EVER.** if you wanna know why, read on---- When we are toddlers, adults teach us how to match. (put the square in the square hole, the triangle with the triangle,circle with the circle etc.) Matching is something monkeys can do but apparently the staff at popeyes cannot. I ordered a number 5 with 2 extra biscuits. i get my food without my biscuits, no sauce and no drink. I then stood there being ignored by the manager and 4 other employees when attempting to ask for the things i had paid for and after finally being acknowledged the man tells me, 'sorry,that guys order was wrong and he was being an asshole.'' to which I though, ''wow you just told me someone was an asshole, AND YOU GOT HIS ORDER WRONG TOO?!"" but i didnt say anything, i just asked for honey and a ranch to which he gives me 1 honey for 3 biscuits and tells me the ranch is .30 EVEN THOUGH THE MENU SAYS MY 'DIPPIN CHICKEN' COMES WITH A DIP! now i am irritated and say ''may i have more honey or should i ask everyone to share 1 honey?'' and then the manager comes over and gives me 2 more, and a ranch but does not apologize for messing my order up. i sit down to eat and it is hot as hell in there, and in the 15 minutes we were there SIX PEOPLE came in with messed up orders!! (and of course the staff was RUDE!) then as i was cleaning up my things to leave, a man walks in and i say, ''if you eat here prepare to have your order butchered. apparently these people dont know how to read and put what you ask for in a bag."" to which he responds, '' haha no, i am sure it will be fine...i am only getting a 3 piece and a drink."" then i sit down to watch him order because by now its entertaining how stupid these people are, he gets his food, checks it, looks over at me with shame and says, ''excuse me guys...you forgot my breast...oh and i asked for 2thighs, this is 2 drums...'' YEAH. PATHETIC. and to think, people like this want 15$ an hour...they should be grateful they arent just getting tips cause they would be REALLY broke!"	3
21	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	1	2	1	This place is FILTHY. They serve old, cold food. Run by total morons. A disgrace to Al Copeland's vision of fast food genius. The best thing that could happen to this place is a grease fire!	4
22	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	0	1	Less than 1 star. Costumer service sucked, the kid working was laughing for no reason at all. The restaurant was dirty and they didn't have any sauces or were not able to make French fries. The workers were sitting in the back on their phone while the trash cans were overflowing and the tables were dirty, will never go to this Popeyes again.	1
23	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	0	1	"I've gone here before love the food but the costumer service is totally horrible. I was at the drive thru placing my order after each time I said I wanted something the employee working the window constantly repeated ""anything else"" I told him yes proceeded to order and he asked again. I still wasn't done ordering. It was as though he was rushing me and I did feel very rushed. I pulled up to the window and there he was still rushing. I gave half cash and half card. I told him I have cash I want to give you and what ever is left place on the card. Tell me why he ran my card twice for both amounts. So at this point I'm pissed off. I asked for the manager she said that she could refund it back to my card and just recharge me. I said no give me my cash back and I'll take the food. So she took my card back and refunded me the money never once told me she was going to when I told her that it was okay to leave it alone. Here I am sitting in the drive thru waiting for food and she comes back and says ""Did you still want the food?"" Ugh no I'm just sitting here waiting for nothing yes I wanted to the food at that point I was super pissed off and left ! Never once did she apologize to me for his actions and never once did she apologize to me for waiting for nothing. I asked for his, her and her managers name I told her I would be calling him very next day and her response was OKAY BYE. Yeah worst service if ever have. I understand it's in a ghetto location and the staff probably doesn't even have a high school diploma and apparently don't have listening skills either but dam. Will never visit again!!!!"	1
24	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	0	1	I usually love Popeye's!! But this location ruined it for me!!!!! They deserve a negative star rating! Im Mad i had to give them 1 star!! Got basic 5 piece chicken strip meal with red beans an rice ( which was dry & nasty ) an wasnt even half of the cup filled. The chicken after only 1 bite tasted like it sat under the warming light for days it was hard. Portions were horriable!! My wife's meal was fish an shrimp. Her shrimp was like rubber an she couldn't bite thru her fish. Truly one of my worst experiences with food. And thats saying alot, Been around the world twice an ate in many different countries. The only thing that was good was the strawberry fanta. An thats because they didnt have anything to do with it!!!    Dont think i'll ever eat Popeye's again.	1
25	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	2	4	2	"I got bad news and I got bad new. Here' the bad news: I ordered one chicken breast, brought it home to add to chicken soup. While I don't generally eat the skin/breeding, as the soup heated I paused to taste the skin/breading. Tasteless. All that work, 66 spices or whatever Popeye's says, TOTALLY TASTELESS. 

Here's the other bad news: the chicken itself was equally tasteless. Not bland, not underwhelming, tasteless. In a blind taste test, it failed as airline food. 

Then, add in the fact he drive-thru speaker sucked, couldn't be heard. And, though It was 9:52 and these children were yelling at each other about closing. Do it WHEN you close. 

I really don't like Popeye's."	2
26	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	7	6	1	"I usually wouldn't write a review about fried chicken chain restaurants, but they're ROTD worthy so maybe this is relevant. I'm usually under the impression that this is better than the other two large chains, but this particular location leaves me inclined to change my mind. Maybe their heat lamps are busted or something, because my food was not far beyond room temperature as well as dried out, with seasoning dumped on indiscriminately. 

I don't even have high expectations for a place like this, but it manages to give me the impression that no one there really gives a shit, and they coast on the franchise name alone. I will eat literally anything on this intersection except for this particular restaurant."	7
27	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	0	1	I gave them 1-star only because you cannot submit a zero-star rating. Horrible experience.  Hubby placed a simple order...3-pieces white meat spicy, 1 extra spicy breast, and 2-pieces dark meat mild. 6 pieces total.  Also wanted onion rings as a side, but this location apparently doesn't do onion rings. When he got the order home, there were two boxes of 2-piece dark meat. Went back to get the order re-done. He was asked if he wanted the original incorrect order because they would just throw it out anyway.  He said Yes, thank you. Good thing he did 'cause  when he got home we found the ONLY part of the order they replaced was the 3-piece white meat spicy.  If he hadn't brought home the original incorrect order, we would have ended up with only three pieces of spicy chicken. Of course, by the time he got back home, everything in the original incorrect order was stone-cold. OH! And they had mixed spicy dark in with the mild dark. Not worth a 3rd trip to try to get it right.  Won't be going back there, again.	0
28	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	0	1	"I came to this location for the third time in 5 years. The first time, this location had good food but there were cockroaches & flies everywhere. The second time was last year 2014, the place was crowded, the staff was very friendly, the restaurant was cleaner but still had a couple of cockroaches around me but then again I'm also Mexican, I lived with cockroaches my entire life lol, but the food was horrible & the chicken was so dry.

Today September 13, 2015 is the third & final time I'll ever step foot in this location. It seemed as if they put out the chicken they cooked last night, the mashed potatoes were very watery. There was no ice in the ice dispenser, I was trying to get help but there was a worker busy watching tv, and another one on her phone. It seemed like I was getting on their nerves cause I wanted help getting ice for me & my kids but they were busy doing their own thing. When we sat on the table there was trash under us & plastic water bottles everywhere. Worst Popeye's experience ever"	3
29	jMpewaaXFr3VeadFBplF0w	0	0	1	"Hands down the worst fast food experience ever!! I went into there seeing that there were 5 people in front of me and knew it would take a bit of time but, an hour!! No exageration either. Every order had something wrong including the people that had ordered even before I got into the place. The women in front of me ordered a 2 piece meal and a 3 piece meal, after realizing that they had charged her for 2 - 3 piece meals she proceeded to go back to the front of the line to tell them about their mistake. They refunded her money and put in a new order for her. During that time a young man behind the counter filled the incorrect order and there it sat. For about 40 minutes. I stood there watching all the previous people continuing to go back for corrections when the manager asked what the order was and who the order there was for. The young man who had filled the order said I don't know who's order it is. They all stood around looking at each other for about 5 minutes before I walked up to the counter and said, I can tell you exacty who's order it is... I proceeded to explain that  it was the order that they had messed up. So they fixed her order and out  she went. When I noticed they  continued to fill orders that were after mine I asked the young man where my order was.I told him my order number and he asked to see my ticket, i pulled it oit of my wallet and finally got my order filled! 
During all this chaos another manager from another location came in to get supplies for his restaurant which took the manger away from her task. She helped him get his supplies and he asked her if he could have some chicken to eat , I guess.? They proceeded to fill his order while all the paying customers had to wait. I will never go to this location again!  I have had other bad experiences here before but never to this degree. Waiting an hour for "" fast food"" is Unacceptable!!  If you plan on going to this location, you better not be hungry . Expect to wait and wait, and wait..."	0

The service was VERY slow and VERY inaccurate.It took about a half hour just to order,which they had only one cashier and a minimal line.When I received my food it was cold,halfway cooked,and not correct.The employees's uniforms were dirty (not from food) but looked like they had not washed them in days.The manager looked like he had just been released from prison and didn't know his job.

When I used the restroom there was no toilet paper,it smelled like cats,dirty walls,floor,toilet,sink and the soap dispenser was surprisingly full (which worried me that employees did not wash their hands!!) I asked the manager for toilet paper and he gave me napkins.

Not even once did I see the employees wash their hands when they were touching the register then packing food.Lobby was disgusting,soda machine was out of majority of drinks,no utensils out in lobby and the AC was on minus twenty degrees.

The only reason I stayed was because my boyfriend wanted the two piece Tuesday special and insisted we stay since we already ordered.My visit to this Popeyes's was horrible and upsetting. I will never go there again and I hope they get new management and crew because this place should of been shutdown!!"	0

My husband ordered 30 dollars worth of food, got home and we realized that the chicken they gave us was old, the biscuits were burnt and even the deserts were wrong. I ended up having to go all the way back there and i explained to them the issue and the ""manager"" had the audacity to not only argue with me but tell me i was wrong! First of all, since when did that become okay to argue with a customer, especially given the fact that i took my own time to come back down there just to get the order I paid for and not their old left overs! Second, i was on the phone with my husband as he ordered and got up to the window and heard this man give him the order back wrong and my husband had to correct him twice. I'm just in awe by this experience and by the fact that this ""manager"" treated me the way he did and talked to me with so much disrespect. Ironically, i worked at this exact popeyes years ago and i would have NEVER treated a customer the way he treated me."	0

The fanta, coke, and sprite all tasted dull and flat. We got our food and the bacon was gross and tasteless. The workshers did have a good understanding of the menu, and the inside was super clean.

35	etGW0g4oIABVeC4Sk5YBDQ	0	0	1	This locations doesent value the safety of their customers. Begers are allowed to stand by drive through menu and run up on customers in their blind spot who are rolling down their window about to order. Drive through worker allows this to happen and if customers are upset about this you are told to leave and refuses to take order. Worst fast food experience I've ever had. I will never go to this taco bell again!!! Almost every time I've been to this location in the past they have been out of something, beans, beef etc... avoid this location unless you are looking to be ran up on in the drive through by people looking to beg or rob you. Their are better options out there save yourself the trouble, your safety is worth more then crap tacos....	0

37	etGW0g4oIABVeC4Sk5YBDQ	0	0	2	Pretty terrible. Not only did they forget a part of my order, they gave me chicken chalupas when I ordered STEAK.. (the cashier even repeated it back to me) also, my chicken bowl was nothing like it was described and was missing some ingredients it claimed to come with. The cashier appeared quite lost and didn't seem to know how to work the register and swayed back & fourth as a nervous gesture? Awkward. Anyway. Not worth the $20. Should've just went to in n out.	1

Soggy tacos suck.... Anyways, while we are eating the counter girl (cashier) was running around asking everyone to do reviews for them and when I said I would, she said she would make sure to make sure that I did it.. She even said ""give me your phone after leaving the review and I will make sure it goes through""... So, went to eat my nachos And noticed that there was a pube in my nachos... A dark black thick/curly pubic hair sitting right in my cheese. I'm a white person with blond hair, I have no idea where this hair came from but I know for sure it wasn't mine. I'm really grossed out by this now.... So, I blow the chick off and just left the place without finishing my meal. Attached is pictures of the pubic hair and my receipt. Maybe the management can review some of the problems that I address and fix them for others. For now, I won't be returning. Too many of these low end places hiring children to serve adults below average food quality. I can do without the pubic hairs in my food...."	0

We should have turned and walked out then. My boyfriend wanted to try the crispy chicken quesadilla but the cashier said they didn't have that ""no more."" He decided on the chicken ""doubledilla"" instead. I got a bean burrito (no sauce or onion) and cheesy fiesta potatoes. My burrito was fine but the fiesta potatoes were crunchy and tasted kind of old, like they had been sitting out awhile. 1 slice of my boyfriend's ""doubledilla"" was just plain tortilla! No meat or cheese in it. And the rest of it was a thin layer of cheese and very little meat. My standards for Taco Bell are relatively low, but somehow they still managed to disappoint."	0

Meh, not that great, I can feel my cholesterol going up already. The SO had an adequate sandwich. Everything seems sort of microwaved, pre-packaged, etc. Plus, their iced tea machine was broken. Boo.  Service was friendly and they checked back, which is good. Of course it was overpriced, it's in an airport. Everything is overpriced.	1

What confused me is in ordered online  and was told my food was ready but when I got there I was told it wasn't. Also my first and last name was in  this big computer screen announcing my order was ready... I didn't like that. Anyway my pizza was not cooked all the way and the cheese and sauce seemed cold yet supposedly it wasn't done yet when I first came in. Also they gave me boneless wings which I called and complained and they just kept telling me to bring them back. Just Super annoying  when they mess your order up and then offer no resolution.	0

OK, not a big deal, it was a Saturday and it looked like a lot of pizza was going out for delivery.  But 15 minutes later seemed awfully long when I have often ordered at a pizza place and got it within 15 minutes without ordering in advance.  I had a pepperoni/sausage with mushroom, green peppers, and onions.  It was OK but needed more sauce as it was a little dry.  There are just too many places to get  pizza to deal with slow and just mediocre.  Can't recommend this location.	1

I would have our  hearing impaired daughter  with us that night and I wanted her to be able to read the lips of the performers.  
The night of the performance, we went early sat in our seats and after 20 minutes we were then was asked to move by another customer who had purchased tickets for the same seats.  'Sweet' Mary the owner, (and I say that lightly)  had absolutely no concern that I came in person early and purchased the tickets for those seats, that our deaf daughter lip reads,  or that we were already seated. She escorted my party of 6 to another table further from the stage. As it came to be, there was another group of people who were sold those same seats.  The same section of seats sold to three separate groups of people...Very very poor management. Extremely poor customer service. I paid nearly $200.00 for fair food, and to be treated as if i had stolen the tickets I had purchased.

Honestly, it wasn't the situation that was hard to swallow, it was that my honest complaint fell on the deaf ears of 'Sweet' Mary who did not bat an eye at taking away what had been honestly paid for and couldn't have cared any less that our hearing impaired daughter was moved away form the stage.

Take your money someplace where it is appreciated."	14
55	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	0	0	1	This review is for the food only. Growing up in northern Arizona in cattle country I was excited to hear about a a good ole cowboy dinner. Unfortunately, this was not it. The beef was extremely dry and the barbecue sauce did nothing to improve the taste. The chicken was tender and just okay. The biscuits and the coffee cake were also just okay. The cowboy beans were well below average. But the biggest transgression is to claim you have a great cowboy dinner and to then serve bad beef.	0
56	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	0	0	1	"There was NOTHING good about this night out. We went with a group and everyone thought the same as I do. WHAT A WASTE OF MONEY! When we arrived there was no one at the will call window. When a person did arrive they did not know anything about the group coming and seemed to be completely unaware that we had made arrangements. I had made contact with Mary numerous times and was told we would have great seats. After finally getting in we found there was NOTHING to do for the next hour. Rockin R Ranch is a broken down fake old town looking place. Sadly it is mostly junk that they are trying to pass off as something. The few walkways were either powder dirt that caused a lot of dust if more than one person walked. The boardwalk ways were uneven and half rotted, we worried about even walking on them. We finally climbed our way to the bar which is not handicapped accessible. There were 3 tables. Knowing we could not all sit down we went back down to wait for the ""show"" and ""dinner"". The most interesting part of the show and dinner was that they actually got over 50 people to buy tickets to this thing. There was no comedy or show other than some really bad singing and a guy that just would not quit talking about how his family was part of the first Mormons to come to Mesa. Then 15 minutes of the show was giving us instructions on how to hold a tin plate when we went through the food line.  It was really pretty sad. The food was not a step up either.  The beef was so tough that no one ate it. The chicken was iffy. The beans were flat, the applesauce was runny and in everything. Apparently you are given applesauce so you have a cool place to hold the plate. Well you had half a plate of cold applesauce and a teaspoon of all the rest. Then about half way through the meal a guy walked through with a FANTASTIC looking bowl of ice cream with all the toppings and whipped cream. After pretending it was available we were told it was FOR SALE back in the back for $5 apiece. We had paid $40 apiece for our tickets. I was embarrassed for the family that is trying to make a living by taking money from unsuspecting people looking for nice night out."	0
57	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	1	0	2	Fun for little kids... cute and cheesy. But If you don't have kids or not going with people that have kids  you may not want to stop in.  we came in from out of town to visit friends whom have children. I believe the kids had a good time. Food was actually pretty good.  Follow directions on how to hold the plate... its not a joke.	7
58	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	1	2	2	"I have lived in the East Valley for 24 years and had never been here.  I remember driving by it on Baseline Road as a teenager (before the 60 extended past Power Road), and thinking what an odd place to have this venue in the middle of the farming fields.  Now, I think what an odd place in the middle of suburbia.  It is a bit touristy, so I probably wouldn't go back and I probably wouldn't take family visiting from out of state either.
We visited on a Friday night.  There was a decent crowd, but not overly congested.  Majority of the visitors were elderly, (I'm guessing snow birds or from the surrounding area retirement communities). The other minority seemed to be families on spring break.  I probably wouldn't recommend going here if you are a young couple without children.  
The entrance opens at 5:30pm, which is plenty of time to mill around the small ""western town.""  My son wanted to spend the entire hour panning for gold.  There was no charge for this, and seemed to be a favorite of all the children attending, as the trough was full of excited children playing in the murky water full of rocks and small pieces of pyrite. 
Before the show, they had sarsaparilla, water, and beer available to purchase.  The gift shop and sweet shop was open, but that is about all there is to see before dinner.  Approximately, 10 minutes before dinner the man selling the beverages, which I believe his name was Cookie, came over and told a little story, and invited us inside for dinner.  
Seating is all pre-arranged; it was easy to find your table and seat number.  Next, Big Jim, an owner, comes out and introduces himself and gives a little history about how his family came to be in Arizona and information about their working ranch.  Afterwards, it was time to get your dinner.  However, Big Jim leads everyone in a ""blessing of the food"" beforehand.  I will say, it was a little weird sitting in a room full of strangers, blessing (praying) our food.  I am not an overly religious person.  I have many friends from diverse backgrounds (Jewish, Buddhist, Latter Day Saint, Christian, Seventh Day Adventist, Catholic), and I respect all religions and religious beliefs, but I was a little uncomfortable obliging this ritual at a public setting.  That's all I have to say about that.
 Dinner was very orderly and organized.  You are called up by row and it is ""buffet style"".  There was plenty of food on my plate, so much so that I couldn't get to the food underneath all the meat.  Finally, I had to go get an extra plate just to clear off the top layer of food on my heaping plate.  The chicken was flavorful; however there was very little meat the bone.  The beef was ok; my husband thought it was the better of the two.  They also served applesauce, beans, biscuits, and spice cake.  Everything tasted fine and I ate a little bit of everything.  However, I wouldn't visit just for the food.  The lemonade tasted like country time mix, but they were generous on the pitcher refills for every table.  Which was a relief when you are sharing a pitcher per table with a bunch of strangers.  After dinner you cleaned up by taking your plates to the back and the show started.
The show was cute, a little long for sitting on a wooden picnic table bench, but tolerable.  They sang a few songs that I recognized, paid a special tribute to the veterans in the audience, and sang the Arizona State song.  While they are singing there are two large screens showing a video of pictures on the side of the stage.  I'm not entirely sure how long the show was, but my husband wanted to duck out.  We stayed because my son wanted to see the gunfight after the show.  The gunfight was a little ""cheesy"" and in my opinion not worth staying for.  My son thought it was the best part of the night.  Of course, it was way past his bedtime, he was exhausted and could hardly keep his eyes open.
Overall, it was a different family night out.  I won't be visiting again. If I had to choose a place to take out of town guests, I would drive down to Old Tucson Studios or Tombstone.  If driving to Tucson wasn't an option, this would be an ok alternative."	9
59	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	0	1	1	DO NOT hold any private events here. Rockin R Ranch apparently ignores noise ordinances, but is surrounded by residential areas. Loud music and other party noises means the police might show up to your event. Awful! Please stay away and spend your money somewhere else!!	6
60	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	0	0	1	I took my cousin from out of town to see this place, I bought the VIP seats on line 2 weeks before we were to go.  The atmosphere and décor of the place is very authentic but needs some work.  The railing going up the stairs to the outside of the salon and the railing around the upper deck are very loose and at some points I would consider dangerous.  We had to stand in line for over an hour although we had printed out the tickets in advance.  The lady in the ticket window had never dealt with this before and she was the only one in there.  There was no manager or owner on site to address the issues.  The show was to start at 630, by the time we even got to the ticket window it was 7pm and there was still a long line.  I got my money back as I was so frustrated and embarrassed at this point I didn't even stay for the show and dinner.  I will never go back and definitely wouldn't take out of town guests there.	1
61	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	0	0	1	this is a review of the wedding venue not the wild west show. my wife and i had our wedding at rockin r ranch on 3-20-15. our wedding was fun because we made it fun and decorated the venue beautifully. the reason we are giving this place 1 star rests on the lady who runs it mary. from the very beginning she was difficult to work with and acted as if every request we had was an impossible task. they waited until the very last day to clean the area that we had our wedding and only did that because we told them to that day. mary failed to show up at our reheasal and when we called her she finally came because we wanted to go over some final requests. the venue was covered with dead leaves and dog poop. there was a non functioning water heater in the bar that was an eyesore and an open barn door with christmas decorations hanging out that we had asked to be covered. they threw a white linen over the water heater and leaned what looked like a big piece of plywood against the barn. what was quite possibly even worse than mary's incompetence was her staff's. the bar tender could not make simple drinks, was on her phone and i kept having to remind her of what we were and weren't paying for. she also disappeared for a half hour and nobody could find her. there was a wedding planner included with the venue that we didnt know about until the last day and honestly he tried his best but he was not helpful. we had complaints of the serving staff slopping food onto guests plates splashing food everywhere. the worst part came at the end of the night when it was time to settle our bill. the bar tender was having trouble figuring out the bill so mary came out to help. mary then gave me the bill and it was not adding up. i asked her why it was so much and she claimed that we had more plates served at our wedding than we payed for. she also said there were 56 mixed drinks served during our cocktail our which seemed like a lot for 45 minutes. she was back pedaling throughout the entire conversation and when we asked her about the bill she had very little evidence as to why it was more and just took off $300 right away as if they were just trying to see if they could get it from us. we still feel like we overpaid but were lucky to get that taken off. i would definitely not reccomend this venue for your wedding. although we made our wedding really nice we still feel like we were cheated by mary and rockin r' ranch.	2
62	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	0	1	1	"Thought this would be a fun place to take my family from out of town... I was wrong! Everything there is 100% thrown together. There's absolutely no AC in any of the buildings (that they turn on). So we sit down for dinner, and it's so hot we felt uncomfortable to even eat. The food was terrible. Looked like a mess. Then expected to pay an extra 1$ for ice cream that melts before you even get it back to your table. We paid for VIP seats & that doesn't get you anything but 2 pieces of meat instead of one... All you can eat isn't true. They only serve Lemonade/Water because of their religion. & I feel as if their religion was pushed onto people... The ""show"" was completely thrown together, really weird. Nobody was that friendly there. The gun shows were cheesy. Very disappointed. Would not recommend to ANYONE! 0/10 !!!"	1
63	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	0	0	1	We are from Chicago and came to Arizona for a visit. We took the whole family to the ranch. We were beyond disappointed with our visit. We got there at 6pm. All but 2 hot biscuits were gone. Everything was closed up. There were no signs saying if we were allowed to go inside the corral with the baby goats to pet them. We couldn't find the pony. Our 3 and 6 year old complained about the music being too loud and screechy. So we went for ice cream, which was closed. Overall, a VERY bad experience. I called to see if we could be given any sort of compensation since we paid over $30 a person and all the lady argued was that what they promised was there. Would have been nice to have some guidance for the out of state guests to know what to do. Horrible customer service.	5
64	LmyysENQBd2AgnDBE90cXA	1	1	2	"My husband and I left the cowboy dinner theater after the song ""Elijah."" The audience was asked to practice and chime in ""an Indian war cry"" as ""Sweet Mary"" donned a headdress, placed her hand in the ""how"" position (think 1950s Lone Ranger) and crossed her arms. My husband is Navajo. He said he could tolerate the cheap looking headdress (straws and feathers?), but the audience being encouraged to do the ""Indian war cry"" was too much. His concern was the children in the audience would learn that it's okay to do that and believe those things are true. He was way more kind than me. It is 2017. Someone in the musical show or family should recognize this is not okay. 
The website says it's family friendly and hospitable/we'll feel comfortable. Not the case. Not for my family. 
Old west town was cute and fun. Food was good - especially the Dutch oven biscuits and the BBQ chicken. Silly jokes and cheesy puns were all good. We enjoyed everything until that song. Please update your repertoire to include all peoples and cultures in respectful ways."	0

I then ordered a Ranch BLT in which they told me 10 minutes after I had ordered that they had not put any chicken down and I'd have to wait longer. I hadn't minded but then 5,10,15 minutes passed and still I hadn't received my food. I then got up from the dirty table I was sitting in and asked for a refund. The cashier at that moment must have misheard me and proceeded to do her duties making the fries for my order and that's when she realized my food had been ready for a while now. I did not want the food since I was already aggravated. Having worked in fast food restaurants myself before I usually have much patience for these things because I know how it feels from the other side, but having to walk into a ""fast food"" restaurant seeing it filthy, waiting about 25 minutes, and receiving terrible customer service is unacceptable. I do not recommend eating at this establishment and I created this yelp just to write this review."	1
