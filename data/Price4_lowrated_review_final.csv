Day after day, they run out of pretty much everything half way through the day, including probably the most popular item, grilled chicken. They don't even care to have the food prepared by 11am, which is the time they tell everyone the main food options will be available by. Along with many other students, I am sick and tired of shitty food and horrible service by the workers. Except for Ashley, she has always been happy and smiling. Everything about this dining hall has been awful and if there were a way for me to take my money back, and put that towards something else, preferably food that is edible, I would greatly appreciate it. Hopefully this will reach the eyes of someone in charge so they can change these ways and start making students happy. But until then, Keep up the shitty service.	2

2. While all Barrett Honors Dining Hall Aramark employees are professional acting and fluent English speakers, whereas other dining halls this is not the case for the employees? The language barrier is a health and safety concern as allergens cannot be properly conveyed when requested.
3. Employees working at food stations tend to stand in back of station, acting busy and avoiding eye contact with guests, to avoid having to retrieve their food. This is especially prominent at the grill stations. They act as though they are immune from any employer discipline for wrongdoing.
4. Employees scuff when asked for an entre at a food station. Often will not say anything after being told ""thank you"" and will toss plate at you under sneeze guard while staring at you.
5. Guests often do not of options at food stations such as tomatoes or lettuce on hamburgers, because they are not clearly displayed on glass and employees often close lids to obstruct view of those items.
6. Employees are often not in correct uniforms, sometimes wearing MLB caps. I have seen POD workers, and other Aramark employees not wearing identifying name badges.
7. I witnessed a POD employee drop a sleeve of unwrapped ICEE cups on ground and then proceed to refill the cup dispenser with those contaminated cups.
8. I have received dirty, coated beverage cups from the ""clean"" cup racks, this is a health and safety concern and is often a warning sign that dishes are not being properly sanitized.
9. The soda fountains do not have ice machines for some reason and on a daily bias run out of ice, and sometime are just completely out of operation. Nearly every day I need to select my third or fourth choice of drink simply because only water comes out, meaning the BIB (bag in box) needs to be changed.
10. There are often no utensils necessary to eat a meal available to guests, they are only put out in limited batches and I have been dining where there wasn't a single one for in the entire dining establishment. There are no utensils at grill station.
11. Menus posted to sneeze guards often contain unavailable or had never been available items.
12. Sun Devil Dining and Aramark seem to cater to the ""vegan"" crowd, while removing food options for other guests, most likely because transitioning to this type of food is cheaper than serving traditional food, but at the same costs to all guests? 
13. The single limited condiment station is out of sauces on an hourly basis, I once notified an employee there was no condiments to which she assured me ""Yes, yes, I get someone"". After waiting for 10 minutes no employee had come to correct the issue.
14. Employees often seem to be sent on break during key operational periods (lunch/dinner ""rush"") and will be seen lounging around on cell phones while stations will often form extremely long lines.
15.  Consistently there are several employees on ""cleaning duty"" simply wiping down tables when long lines at food stations, but somehow the dining hall is consistently in unclean condition.
16. Guests often complete the surveys asking what they would like to see improved but Sun Devil Dining / Aramark have not acted on a single one of these suggestions.
Overall, the dining experience with Sun Devil Dining / Aramark has been the worst ever seen on any university or institution campus, and it seems to stem from the employee/company culture of ""we have your money, what are you going to do about it?"" 
Immediate change is needed or will result in sharing of these findings to prospective students, and if deemed necessary local and state health and safety organizations.
DEMAND CHANGE FROM ASU. STOP GETTING RIPPED OFF."	1

The girl at the drive through told me she talked to the owner whose name is ""David Kralovich"" and said they would not respect my coupon. I called in and asked to speak to the owner and another girl (Ashley) informed me that the owner was not there. I am appalled that these employees can lie straight to their customers and they claim it is a ""pleasure to serve you"". I had to wait for 25 minutes in the drive through line and got NOTHING. Do not trust this incredulous company."	1
3	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	2	Very slow service and still a lot of kinks. They  often mess up my order and their cookies are hard as rocks every single time. Also their customer service isn't as friendly as other chick fil a restaurants I've been to. It's close to me but I would rather drive to the one in Gilbert to ensure good service	2
4	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	1	We love Chick-fil-A, but coming here was like we entered the Twilight Zone. How can the crew be so wonderful everywhere else and so rude, unfriendly, unkempt here?!?!  We were the only car in the Drivethru and no-one would acknowledge us for a five minutes...then a car pulled up in the other lane and got served before us!!!!  When I mentioned that all I got was a blank stare...NO apology at all!	0
5	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	2	We are huge Chick Fila fans, but this location seems to be having a difficult start up.  We waiting over 30 minutes in the drive thru line during a time window in between lunch and dinner.  As a result, we have not been back.  We've been driving a little further out of our way to the location near the Chandler mall to ensure more reliable service.  Very disappointing.  Not sure if and when we'll try this location again.  I thought that Chick Fila used to send a team of experienced workers to ensure a smooth transition of newly opened stores...not sure why the opening of this location has been so bumpy.	1

Customer service is not like the others locations."	0
7	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	1	Went through the line for almost 20 minutes at once like but to the window telling me that they're out of chicken fillets....	0
8	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	2	I am hoping the owner is watching these because this is a great location and set of owners but they have the rudest employees. There is an older lady (grandma age) that is amazing and a young guy ( looks super young) that are always amazing but I went thru the drive thru and the girl was rude and confused. The women that is a day shift manager doubted me when I told her a sandwich was missing and took my bag and unpacked it piece by piece. I was shocked by her doubtful attitude. As soon as they get it together I will adjust this review but please get it together	0
9	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	2	They kept messing up my order . I didn't believe the reviews.. I was asking myself : how can there be a bad Chick-fil-A ? Well there is. And this location is just sad .	0
10	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	1	My order is always wrong the lines are too big inside and outside and I ordered a large ice cream and was out almost 4$ and it looked like a sample. The drive thru is always a 20 min wait so is inside.	1
11	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	2	I typically love Chick-fil-A, but this one isn't typical. Well the food was decent, and the workers were pleasant. It's evident that this one is clearly miss managed. People were waiting for things. There was problems getting people helped. Which is odd for a Chick-fil-A, because they're almost never ran that way.  The person behind the counter did a great job, the issue was she was the only person behind the counter.	0
12	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	1	the location is perfect and it's clean and nice but customer service is probably the worst i've seen. i went inside because the drive through is always a long wait. i was the only in who ordered and waited 10 minutes for my meal while my friend waited 15 minutes for one sandwich and others who got there after us were getting there food before us. when we went up to the counter to ask about our food we were ignored and the workers don't give off a good vibe either.	0
13	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	1	1	"What an absolute horrible experience.  I went in on a Saturday morning to grab something quick and get to a baseball game.  I went inside because the drive thru line was long.  I was the only one ordering from at the counter.  I then proceeded to wait 15 minutes my one meal.  

I decided to give them a try another day, and while the wait was not quite as long, I still waited 8 - 10 minutes for my meal.  I do not think I will be going back to this location until I hear of some improvement in their delivery."	2
14	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	2	I am a huge Chik-fil-a fan and this location is not up to par. I have gone twice now and the service was terrible. The first time I went our order was missing items the second time the salad I got was old and the chicken was chewy. I will stick with the location on Chandler Blvd.  Always friendly, fast and fresh food. I hope they can get it together. I won't be going back. Huge disappointment.	1

I didn't notice until I got home when we opened the food to eat. I called to let them know, not that I cared about the $.30 price differential that erred in their favor, but about the principle. If I have to pay for cheese, I at least want to get the cheese, or whatever the case is. I was stuck between two people on hold, and David, the GM, came on but had put me on another hold. I had stuff going on and had to go. He called back, and apologized for the inconvenience and offered to send me a gift card. I didn't want to have them hassle with sending me a gift card, I just wanted (since he called back) to adjust my meal on the next visit to compensate for the error the first time. He says come in next time I am here, ask to talk to David, and he will make it right and comp the meal. Okay great. 

I come in a few weeks later, tell my story to the order taker lady, get a look like I'm crazy, and the lady I talk to goes and talks to David, in front of me. I place my order, told the story, and then there was an awkward wait while the lady talked to the GM. I don't like feeling awkward so I said don't even worry about it, all I originally wanted was to get this $.30 cheese taken care of, and the person taking my order couldn't figure out how to do that. So I said don't worry about it, just let me pay the full price and be done with it. Well I could hear and see David and the other lady talking, again like I was crazy. I told the lady I can tell David himself the story since he was right there getting it second hand now from this other lady. He clearly didn't remember by her telling the story what had happened and what he had told me. Finally I got to pay and be done. Food came out. It was fine, but they still got the order wrong (I ordered no pickles, twice in fact since they had to redo my order).  

I came out of my way to visit this place again. I hate being wronged, calling them on it, and feeling like I'm the bad guy by their actions and the way they handled this situation. All over $.30 cents that I originally didn't even care about, other than wanting to let them know and maybe get the cheese comped the next time since I paid for it once and never got it. 

If the GM tells me to drop his name, ask to talk to him so he can deliver on righting the situation, I expect that. If I follow up, and then I'm the bad guy for doing what he says, well that's not how customer service works. Canes is right down the road, and there's another CFA I will drive a little further to go to."	1
16	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	1	0	1	Waited for over 25 minutes in through to get a chicken sandwich. This is absolutely ridiculous. Not the first time this has occurred at this location. Will never come to this location again!!	1
17	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	1	1	Slowest chick-fil-A ever.  Food was fine but do not come here if you are in a hurry - especially over lunch during the week.  Was stuck in the drive thru for 15 minutes because it is a dual lane setup, which just slowed everything down even more.	0
18	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	1	"The dining room is filthy. Have gotten old food multiple times. Staff is unfriendly(for Chick-Fil-A standards)
No ""thank you""s or ""My pleasure""s
Only received two sauces for a $30 order.
This store is the ghetto cousin of the Chick-fil-a
Family.

Avoid at all costs."	1

When we checked in and saw 2 stars, we figured they must be reviews from teenagers from the high school. Nope. Worst location we've ever been to. The dining room was filthy, trash cans full, took a really long time to order even though we were second in line, none of the usual service or ""my pleasure"". The only plus side was I got a salad for the first time ever and it was actually pretty good- the Spicy Southwest one."	0

21	hZQcvxixLVO5nyYQ9DeG6Q	0	0	1	I love chick fil a and was so excited when they built this location.  Unfortunately this has to be the worst  chick fil a I've ever been to from a food and customer service experience.  Either the teams are understaffed or not incentivized like other locations.   I hope the owner figures it out bc I live 2 miles away and drive up to the Chandler Ave location bc the service is so poor on Az ave.	0

Breakfast used to be decent, but they hire, I assume, parolees or people on work release that worked in the prison chow hall. The ""omelet"" I ordered was a mess of veggies and some ham and cheese on the bottom of my plate. Why is there cheese on the bottom of my plate? Because the ""cook"", and I use that term VERY loosely, did not know how to make an omelet so he put the cheese on top of the eggs, and flipped the whole thing onto my plate. There used to be a good cook, but like most things around that kitchen, if they are good at their job, they get rid of them, you know, because people might like their food and come back. Boeing needs to really reassess their food service vendor and like someone else previously mentioned, do what Intel did, and hire a company that takes pride in their job. Boeing employees deserve better than this."	0
23	uudgwwFZhdWG8CVvmNsGdg	0	2	1	Total garbage. Its irritating that they have absolutely no problem taking advantage of the hard working Boeing employees. Mostly fried bar food, and anything that isn't unhealthy shit is ridiculously expensive. I made the mistake of getting 3 sausages (plain with mustard), a banana, and a diet coke. Any guesses on cost? About $19. Wow. Same with breakfast. 3 eggs? About $2.10. Not too bad. Throw some tomatoes and onions on? Now it's a $4 veggie omelette. Seriously, fuck this place. Boeing needs to fire Aramark. We're a Fortune 500 company. We can afford to take care of our employees. If Intel can do it, so can we.	2
24	uudgwwFZhdWG8CVvmNsGdg	0	1	2	When I started working here, I was pretty lazy about bringing lunch, and the cafeteria food was decent enough to keep eating. Nothing really sucks, tastewise; I'll get a philly or Rueben as a guilty pleasure. However since bringing my lunch more consistently to save money, I've noticed something any time I eat the cafe food. I'll feel super bloated and lethargic and gross, almost guaranteed. Morning: feels great, After lunch: shirt doesn't fit. It seems pretty 20th century not to have a variety of healthy lunch options (not just a chicken sandwich or salad or 8$ fish). I'm thankful for this realization; as I'll think twice before getting the fried option now.	0
