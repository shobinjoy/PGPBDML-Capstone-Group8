Friday 8/26/16 I went for all the great reasons  one goes here for......
I ordered the the great ahi tuna tostada-y appetizer.  About two bites in I noticed a long black hair. Ugh...
The response and actions by the staff and manager was remarkable.  We all have miserable things happen at work and this is probably their biggest nightmare. 
Congrats O club personnel, you and your restaurant still rank as one of the best!

Looking forward to next year ..."	1

Our waitress Sarah was amazing!  She was so attentive and answered every question I asked her about the menu! She also served me my food! We couldn't believe how awesome this place was! 

Live music at the bar! 

Can't wait to go again! Oh ps they called me this morning to thank me for dining with them! So cool!"	1

Eric Kelly, really helped create an amazing meal for my husband and me. He is very professional, knowledgable, friendly, and knows good food! I told him that I loved seafood and he helped us pick out the  perfect oysters, sashimi appetizer, and perfect preparation for my tuna. My husband, who is more of a meat lover even liked the sashimi! The food at the Oceans Club is exquisite, but when that is complimented with great service, it becomes such a more memorable experience. Thanks for the great experience Eric! We plan on going back the next time we are in Scottsdale!	0

8	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	"I usually go to City Hall but wanted to try Ocean Club. The food and service was outstanding as expected from a Mastro's restaurant. My guests also enjoyed their dinners and dessert (can't forget the warm butter cake- if only for the fresh whipped cream!) The food was cooked perfectly, the dishes came out together and everything was enjoyable. Love the lobster mashed potatoes.

Great location but a little harder to park- Valet, it is easier."	0
9	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	3	0	5	"This place was poppin!  Right when we came in, the host and hostesses were ready to help out.  You could hear chatter from every corner since everyone was enjoying their dinner experience.  So it may be a little difficult to hear and converse with alongside the live band.  Being a little early we started with their house Cabernet at the bar.  The wall was covered with a variety of bottles of every ETOH imaginable seemed like.  

So what was devoured over dinner?
Bread basket with a creamy yummy butter
Appetizer:  Seared Ahi Tuna - a nice starter before the main course, they have a wide selection of appetizers to choose from.
Entree:  Seared Chilean Sea Bass - excellent!  The outside had a little bit of crisp and crunch while the inside was perfectly moist and tender and flavorful.  I would definitely eat this again!  This can also be ordered blackened or ""bread crumb"" style.
Side:  Sautéed asparagus - I only ate the top part, as the stem part of the asparagus was not as easy to chew.  Nonetheless, tasty! 
Dessert:  Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake - so delightful and buttery melt-in-your-mouth experience.  It was topped with vanilla ice cream and drizzled with a strawberry syrup or similar and garnished with fresh strawberries.  It also came with a separate bowl of vanilla whipped mascarpone cream.  This can be shared between 2 to 4 people easily.  Coffee (pretty large cup in size) was also enjoyed with this dessert. 

Service was on point:  clean, attentive, knowledgable, friendly
Music:  live band, live singers, in tune, up-to-date music, great performance and easy on the ears
Overall a classy experience!"	1
10	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	The best food, service, and atmosphere of anyplace we've been! Our server was exceptional and even brought us butter cake on the house.	0
11	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	1	0	4	"Ocean Club is a great place to impress a date. The atmosphere is great, service is fantastic and the food is good. The atmosphere and service surpasses the food. 
They serve a great basked of bread. But they can skip everything but the pretzel bread. I am totally addicted to Ocean Club's  pretzel bread. I always order more and they bring another basket which the waiter delivers without a roll of the eyes . The butter is soft - can't stand it when the butter comes out a cold little ice cube. Here it is soft and ready to spread. We started with the Seafood Tower. We picked crab, lobster and a few others.  That was where we could have stopped and been full but didn't. 

I had the lemon sole. Okay I was not that impressed. It was  a bit dry and not much flavor. That was disappointing but since I was full already - not a big deal. My guy got the Chilean Sea Bass and loved it. Of course we had the lobster potatoes which is a rich and large dish that could be a dinner for two. Then we topped it off with their signature Butter Cake and chocolate cake. Both were great. But portions are big so you really only need one dessert (and more romantic to split a dessert!). 

The service is the best thing about Ocean Club. The wait staff is attentive but don't interrupt you every 15 seconds. They seem to just know when something is needed or wanted. 

If you want to impress your date, get seating inside the restaurant area. If you want to do people watching and the noise doesn't bother you, the bar area is the place to be."	0
12	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	By far the best fine dining seafood dinner in the country.  Get the seafood tower as an appetizer or to share as a meal between 2-3 people.  The seabass oregento style is amazing!!!!	0
13	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Love this place!  I've never had a bad meal here.  If you go, no matter how full, get the butter cake!!!	0
14	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	Food is great, service was amazing , but very very expensive. Not that the cost takes away from the meal as the food and service pretty much made up for the price .  The bar scene was pretty comical and trying hard to be a mini Vegas but everyone was having a good time that wanted to be there .	0
15	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	You can't go wrong with any of the Mastro family of restaurants. Ocean Club is always our go-to for celebratory dinners, but it doesn't come cheap. Expect to spend about $200 for a couple depending on what your order. I would definitely suggest the Chilean sea bass, lobster mashed potatoes, and warm butter cake. Also, the pomegranate martini is deadly. Enjoy!	1
16	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	We went for dinner last night and the food and service was excellent. Would definatly reccomend. They went overboard for our special occasion. Great dinner.	0
17	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	This restaurant is about as first class as it gets.  The food and service were just spectacular and the ambiance quite romantic.  It's a very good place for a nice dinner for two with your spouse more than anything, although I saw all kinds of people there. The menu is a bit pricey and everything is a la carte, so be prepared for a big check.  I loved the whiskey menu, quite extensive.	0
18	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	"Excellent dinner, wonderful service. Steaks were cooked to perfection. Lobster mash was unbelievable - with large pieces of meat, very tasty and enough to serve 4. My very ""particular"" husband gave it a 10 (that is a rareity). The warm butter cake is delightful and, again, enough to serve 4. Looking forward to the next occasion to celebrate at Mastro's OC!"	0
19	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Went to the OC. Atmosphere nice, food tasty, prices high compared to what i am used to in similar restaurants.	0
20	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	"Went there for special occasion. Great bar and drinks. Ordered Hawaiian tuna. Kitchen overdosed on toasted sesame seeds and tuna didn't appear to be same day fresh and somewhat stringy. Manager was kind enough to make amends. Otherwise everything else was great!!! Billy the bartender and Chris the waiter always super. 
Will go back but will probably not be ordering the tuna again. Enjoy."	0
21	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	1	0	5	"This is the type of Resturant that truly deserves five stars. I went with a ""difficult to please"" family member and our waiter was fantastic. The food was on point and the wine selection was wonderful. Every staff member is there to help you enjoy the experience and we were all quite impressed."	1
22	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	Been here a few times and always end up getting the Chilean seabass!  Best tasting fish I ever had!  I believe it's about $40 just for the fish itself, but oh my it's worth eating good fish and having it prepared right.  I love the diff. bread options they give you off the bat- cheese, pretzel, mini baguete, and some other kind.  You have to order the sides separately, so whatever you get don't get the lobster mashed potato...not worth it.  Cant taste any lobster for that price!  Giving it only 4 stars since i haven't tried much of the other main entrees.	0
23	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Ocean Club is excellent! Ordered the scallop dish and it was fabulous! Great atmosphere and ambience! Highly recommended!!!	0
24	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	I went here 2 months ago and was disappointed with my fish. Gave it another try but this time had a filet. I will have dreams about that filet. Cooked perfect and had awesome flavor. Service was 10 times better too. Glad I gave it another shot.	0
25	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	My girlfriend and I went on Friday night to check out the bar and in doing so met a very friendly, helpful wait staff gentleman.  His name is Iggy, he is a native New Yorker and was very pleasant to speak with.  He made us feel very comfortable and even brought us out a bread basket after the kitchen had closed.  Kudos to Iggy for great customer service!!	0
26	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	"This place was amazing. Very expensive, but on a special occasion, it was a perfect place. My ribeye was one of the best steaks I've ever had, as was the twice baked potato. My wife had the Alaskan king crab legs, and it was literally 3 giant legs, already half shelled. Amazing. Good dessert, great selection of scotch and fancy drinks and presentations for plates. The ambiance was great too. You could tell it was all fancy. Service was good. Definitely don't come if you are in a rush. We were there for over 2 hours, but we never felt like we were waiting. It was a ""good"" 2 hours. Unless you're super rich and you know it, I'd hold off wearing jeans and tennis shoes. This place is too fancy for normal attire. Slacks and a nice shirt or polo would do fine."	1
27	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	This place is more of an event than as meal. They have good live entertainment and the patrons at the bar are worth watching. Very good drinks that include a nice selection of wine to a martini with dry ice so it bubbles. The best thing about the filet was the nicely charred crust and that it was on a 400 degree plate so that every bite was as good as the first. The baked potato was good not great. Duke is a great server who can help you enjoy your time there. The only reason I didn't give it 5 star is because i have had better Good less money.	0
28	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	Enjoyed our anniversary dinner here recently and the only reason why I'm giving it 4 stars instead of 5 is that I think it's too high for what you receive.  Yes, it's in the Kierland area alongside Dominicks, Mortons Eddy V's, etc., but overall I think it's high for seafood.  We have enjoyed all of the other Maestro steak houses but hadn't yet tried Ocean Club. We were there on a Monday night and it was still a busy place for a weekday.  Bar  area is gorgeous, and they have live music every night of the week.  We sat at a table in the bar so we could listen to the music and it was not too loud so that we could still talk and enjoy ourselves.  Service was stellar, Nick was our waiter and he did a great job. The menu is seafood primarlly and steaks which are prepared the same at any of the Maestro properties (City Hall and Mastro's Steakhouse)..The seabass was outstanding and hubby had the ahi tuna...we shared a salad and lobster mashed potatoe as a side (everything is big enough to share) and a great bottle of wine...Butter cake is to die for so don't miss that.	0
29	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Truly the best steak house in the country. Do not pass on the Butter cake it's unreal	0
30	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	"Went to Mastro's Friday, Nov 24 to celebrate my daughter-in-laws' birthday.  The meal was fantastic and the service was great.  

I had Grouper and it was so delicious.  We also had a side of scalloped potatoes and pea pods.  For an appetizer we had roasted bone marrow.  Wow that was a treat.

We didn't have dessert however our waiter, Michael, brought a large piece of oh so good chocolate cake to celebrate my DILs' birthday.

Expensive but so worth it for a treat."	0
31	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	When you go to the Ocean Club, it feels like a special event...even if you're just there for a drink.  If you're interested in a world class dinner for business or with friends/family, Ocean Club has never disappointed.  The lounge is very cool with live music and table clothed high tops.  I'd recommend having one or two gin martini's but they've got whatever you're looking for.  It's my favorite.	0

34	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Finally tree Mastro's ocean club! I can't believe I waited this long to try it. What a great place and amazing food. From the drinks to appetizers to dinner and dessert.....everything was perfect! I started the night with their cosmo which has dry ice in it so it starts out smoky and cool looking. We had a seafood tower and iceberg wedge salad to start with. The seafood tower was amazing! Fresh seafood displayed perfectly on the platter. The wedge salad was good, but I will say I have had better.  For dinner I had filet with mash potatoes, Brussels sprouts and salt and vinegar fries!!! All of it was outstanding. Saving the best for last was the butter cake which was beyond any dessert I have ever had!!! Everything was great and I will be back very soon! The only drawback about everything was the charge for valet. I thought it was silly for this type of restaurant to charge for valet.	0
35	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	This is by far the best ribeye I have ever had! The only downside is the way you are welcomed and the atmosphere isn't as classy as I would like it to have been. When paying $50+ for a steak I don't like to feel rushed. I fealt that we were sort of being rushed since there were so many people waiting to be seated. Other than that, I loved the food.	0
36	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Five star, five star, five star everything!! Their Lobster mash is the single best side I've had in my life. The fillet was stupid good and the service was excellent. This was my 5th time at Mastros and I will come here every time I'm in the Scottsdale/Phoenix area!	0
37	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	white table cloth, outstanding food, incredible service.  what else is there to say?  first time at a mastro's and boy was it an experience.  sides are served family style so be careful on how much you order.  i shared my lobster tail with my wife.  it was very good.  the bone in rib eye that she ordered was absolutely delicious.	0
38	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Two friends joined me for a Sunday evening dinner and drinks. I have been to Mastro's many times and have never been disappointed. The live music in the lounge was so very good, we stayed there in the bar area for dinner and loved it. We ordered our favorites: Red wine, their famous Martinis (exceptional Martinis), the seafood appetizer, Tomahawk steak (not on the menu-just ask your server about it, that incredible steak was enough for all 3 of us) with Lobster Mashed Potatoes (out of this world) and for dessert the butter cake (a must have). All were magnificent. Mastro's really has it down, amazing food and excellent service, my personal favorite place, always an awesome experience.	0
39	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	2	2	5	"The staff is so excellent here they were literally falling on their own two feet to serve you. They have a dedicated water runner to notice if your water is not full and when he (in this case) noticed he ran to get water. Same applies to wine except the server was in charge of that. 

Literally have not had service so excellent before. And that's only the service. 

Let's talk about the food. You have to have to get the seafood tower. The shrimp were so large and juicy... I wanted more than just one! Good thing I ordered the ocean house salad which used the same shrimp. My mouth is watering just thinking about those amazing shrimp. 

Kumamoto Oysters available? YOU HAVE TO GET THEM. So sweet, so delicious, and no seawater/briny taste. It is something not to miss. 

For the sides, lobster mashed potatoes!! And they don't skimp on the lobster. Whole chunks of succulent, juicy lobster! Also another must get. Sauteed sugar snap peas were also super delicious. Creamed spinach was alright, not a favorite for me. 

But overall, all the sides went very well with my CHILEAN SEA BASS. Cooked to perfection: soft, tender, juicy, no fishy-ness at all. Another highly recommend. 

Top your night off with the butter cake dessert, super deccadent, but YOLO right? Workout later. :) 

I am so impressed with Mastro's Ocean Club. First rate service, even better food."	4
40	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	The food is absolutely amazing and we always request a professional, personable server by the name of Shawn Feeny.  He is a great guy that makes the experience all that better.  Highly recommend this establishment.  Their Filet and Crab legs are wonderful and cooked to perfection.  The ambiance gives a sense of relaxation, yet it is a fine dining restaurant which I find appealing.	0
41	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Wow! The steak was super tender and full of flavor! The sides were excellent also. If you're a fanboy bone-in ribeye you will love this Mastro's. Had simple dinner, but extraordinary flavor. Had the chopped salad, bone-in ribeye, asparagus and fries. Entire meal and service was without blemish - definitely a 5 star evening.	0
42	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	1	4	"Had dinner here with my best bud.  Very fancy and posh inside.

I enjoyed the chef cut NY strip.  It was 16-18 ounces.  Very nice.  It was $58.

Also had a variety of oysters.  Yes, we knew that the month didn't have an ""r"" in it, but I am writing a review several days later.  The oysters were very enjoyable - 3 different types.

The menu has all your top steak choices, also lots of fish.  It's Ala-carte.

Seem to have a massive wine selection, and the best of spirits.

Probably want to dress up a bit when coming here.  Although behavior doesn't seem to matter much according to the dude at the table next to us :)"	0
43	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	I went to Mastros during a trip to Scottsdale with my husband and some friends. This was by far one of the best meals I've ever had. The wait staff was attentive. The Martinis came with a shaker of extra drink. The food was delicious. I can't say enough how great this meal was. We will seek it out next time we travel.	0
44	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Fantastic experience while out with the family.  For a nice treat opt for the seafood tower.  The cosmos made with dry ice are a great conversation starter.  This is a wonderful special occasion place or when out with friends to simply celebrate life.	0

47	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	7	3	5	"Love this place. I've frequented the two locations in LA and was interested in how the experience would be in Phoenix. Did not disappoint. Loved the food. Loved the wine. Loved the live music that softly flowed from the bar area into the dining area. Loved loved loved the butter cake. Loved the service. You guys rock!

Did not like the whole valet thing. They even had the handicap spots roped off and had a Bentley and a Maserati parked in the handicapped spaces. Not saying people with handicap stickers don't drive those type of cars but I suspect those were cars valet parked and had nothing to do with handicap stickers. If they did legitimately have handicap parking rights, my bad. But if not, shame on you guys."	4
48	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	I came here last week for dinner and was very satisfied. Our server was extremely professional and gave us his presentation of the menu very well, no questions were left unanswered. For such a large party (There were ten of us) drinks and wine came in a timely manner, only one drink took a little longer which the manager delivered himself and apologized for. We ordered two giant seafood towers with jumbo shrimp, lobster claws, crab legs, and split lobster tails. We took our servers recommendation on how many of each we would need to accommodate our party and he didn't over do it to try and up sell more than we needed. (Very impressed by this) The seafood was amazingly fresh and considering there is no ocean nearby it's actually the best I have had in Arizona. We all ordered steak, which all came out at perfect temperatures. I ordered the Bone In Ribeye medium plus which was juicy and tender with a nice light char. They use swarm service here for larger parties which was nice for delivery of food and pick up, but a little crowded since half of us were up against a wall. The only thing I didn't like was that they served our sides for us and I literally got one bite of each side which was just thrown by my steak. Dessert came and our server recommended a trio so everybody could have enough. It came with thier famous buttercake, a GIANT chocolate layer cake and a key lime pie centered with ice cream and whip cream! Delicious.	0

I really liked that the ambiance wasn't as dark as other steakhouses. The lobster mash potatoes were to die for. The fish, crab cakes and steak were all great selections too. An incredible place to dine with family and friends. We will definitely be back to visit.	0
51	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	5	4	5	"In a single word, Awesomeness....  For a restaurant that is part of a chain of restaurants, there's really nothing that can compare to Mastros.  There's nothing chain about the experience or the ambiance of Ocean Club.  

My last visit here was on a night in the middle of the week.  That didn't stop what seemed to be the rest of Scottsdale from coming here for a great evening of food and libations.  When you walk into Ocean Club, there is an ambiance that simply states sophistication and upscale.  

I was fortunate to be on the arm of a dashing and handsome gent as we were joined by another couple.  We were seated promptly for our reservation at a fantastic table that had a great view across the dining room.  The service was impeccable.  We ordered drinks and a bottle of wine suggested by our server.  We ordered a couple of appetizers and we were set for while as we looked over the menu and carried on conversation with our friends.  

My friend and I are pretty easy to please at restaurants like this.  Dare I say, we're pretty predictable.... for me almost always I order sea bass if it is on the menu and my friend 100% orders bone-in filet.  We were in luck, they had both on the menu as a great and amazing establishment like this should.  Their sea bass was as buttery and delicious as it was the first time I had it and all the other times thereafter.

So, the sides are where we usually get somewhat creative.  I suggest the lobster mashed potatoes, so very yummy and succulent and filling.  Not something I would order, but I definitely enjoy when someone else has ordered it at the table!  The garlic mashed potatoes are also tasty.  My friend loves the creamed corn.  My personal favorite is the sauteed spinach.  

For dessert, my friend loves Mastro's butter cake and we never go there without having it.  Again, very tasty and delicious.

This is a place to bring your mom for her birthday or parent's wedding anniversary, a woman that you are with that you care for or just care to get with.  This place is fantastic.  It is truly as good as it gets.  I'm also a HUGE fan of Mastro's Steakhouse.  I'm totally biased, this is the best restaurant chain on the planet.  Period."	4
52	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	In my sincerest opinion this place was created for the sole satisfaction of consuming only the finest grade of beef. I have been to Steak 44, Durant's, Ruth's Chris, The Keg, Lawry's, listed as ranked in my opinion. The place that keeps me coming back for the special celebration is Mastro's. The environment, service and quality are a cut above. Whether you are in the mood for a seafood tower, an amazing salad, or a scrumptious melts in your mouth steak. This is your place......trust me! This place oozes good looking people and money. The other steakhouse are not even a close second, they are filled with high class escorts and Porsche driving men that have something to prove to themselves. Oh, I almost forgot about the freshly baked bread is a slice of heaven.	0

Awesome food, awesome service, great ambiance.  I recommend the Scallops, Lobster Mac and Cheese, Chilean Sea Bass and the Butter Cake.  Also, like all Mastro's, they have an excellent wire selection.  The day after our visit, I got a call from the restaurant thanking me for my business.  Very highly recommended.	0

Like 3 people deep, crowds around the bar, and constant tickets printing for drinks in the dining room busy.

We got really dressed up and did a fancy date night and this place was absolutely great for it! Energy is great, food is amazing and the dessert is die for.. must try buttermilk cake!!! Our server Jared (I think) was also very very nice and fun!	0

We had reservations for our wedding anniversary and was promptly seated. Outstanding drink and meal menu. We ordered the oysters  and two cocktails (jalapeño martini for me) with a perfect amount of kick to it. I ordered the Hawaiian big eye tuna served sashimi style. I would definitely recommend it. They gave us a complimentary anniversary desert which included their whipped cream made from scratch which threw me off guard with the amount of homemade flavor. 

The staff was real nice and professional. I would highly recommend this place for special occasions or if you're just craving a great meal. With the exception of parking, we truly enjoyed our time. I will definitely be retuning."	0

Our night didnt start exactly as planned since the restaurant took 30 minutes from our reservation time to seat us. However, from the minute we sat down the evening was great. The ambience is very sleek and classy. There was great live music and a lot of great energy in the room. Given the price range, the crowd is mostly older. 
We had the crab cakes and lobster bisque for appetisers. The server was very knowledgeable about the menu and gave helpful advise to share since the helpings are big. We had the John Dory, pacific swordfish, chilean sea bass among five people.. It is advisable to order some sides since the fish doesnt come with any accompaniments. The fish was perfectly cooked per specifications but the presentation could be a little more appetizing than just slabs of fish on a plate.
Since it was a birthday dinner, the restaurant gave a huge complimentary slice of a chocolate cake which was delicious. 
The place is expensive, the food is delicious and the ambience is classy so can certainly be tried for a special occasion."	0

Kerrie was beyond amazing . She took such great care of us and took some genuine care into making sure our daughter (who has food allergies) was taken care of,

The service exceptional and my bone in filet was absolutely seasoned and cooked to perfection. If you are looking for a restaurant for a special occasion I highly, highly recommend Mastros! The butter cake was to die for. Expensive wine and liquor menu to accompany the meal. Knowledgeable employees that were as pleasant as you could ask for. I'm definitely looking forward the visiting here again. So much so that I'm looking for a reason! Thank you Mastro's and we hope to see you soon. You have restored my faith in restaurants.

I ordered the 12oz filet medium and sides, but unfortunately the filet comes a little bit over cooked. Still flavorful and very good meat, but not exactly the way I wanted it. The staff offered to cook another steak, but that wasn't really an option as I didn't feel like waiting.

Soon the manager approaches me and insists on taking it off the bill, even though I would have been willing to pay for it. Great customer service - ""we just want it to be perfect"".

No question I will come back."	1

On New Years Eve, we were on our way for our reservation there when we had a flat tire about a mile from the restaurant.  We were already running late, but we called The Ocean Club to tell them what happened, and they said no problem they would hold the reservation.  We ended up calling a taxi, had a delicious meal, and then returned to our car and called AAA.  We were about 35 minutes late for reservation but Ocean Club held it all that time, even tho it was probably the busiest night of the year.  They took the stress out of a very stressful event.  Thank you Ocean Club	0
80	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	2	0	4	"I had been to the cougar den a/k/a the bar at this location before, but never dined in the restaurant, so the bf and decided to check it out, as City Hall is one my favorite restaurants.  Our reservation was at 7:45pm on a Friday, we were finally seated around 8:30.  They were clearly running behind schedule.  However, it was a nice touch that they offered all the waiting guests a glass of champs.  Classy move!  

We were seated next to a big table and they were SUPER loud, so if you're in the mood for a quiet and romantic evening, be sure to request a table away from the bar area and not right next to larger tables.  The bf and I get excited when we see lobster bisque and clam chowder on menus, so I started with the clam chowder and he had the lobster bisque.  Surprisingly, considering this is a seafood restaurant and the high price point, they were both just okay.  Not bad, but definitely not the best we've had.  For our entrées, I had the scallops and the bf had the swordfish Oscar style.  Both were really good!  The scallops were large and plump.  Although the sauce they were in was good, I almost felt like it was a little too heavy for the scallops.  Maybe I'm just a purist -- I like my scallops sautéed in butter and garlic.  But the dish was still good.  We also had the sautéed spinach and lobster mashed potatoes as sides.  The lobster mashed potatoes is a favorite of ours from City Hall, and even at $35, they're worth it!  Large chunks of lobster and puddles of butter -- it doesn't get much better than that.  We would have normally finished off with the butter rum cake, another of our favorites from City Hall, but we were so stuffed that we couldn't eat anything else.

Our server, who was awesome all evening, brought our check and informed us they had comp'd my glass of wine and then taken off an extra $20 because we had to wait so long.  So that was $40 off our bill -- awesome!  Another classy move!  And to top it off, I received a voicemail from the hostess the following morning following up on our experience!  I originally would have put this review in the 3.5 star category, but the service is so outstanding that it is definitely worthy of 4 stars!"	3

Tender juicy Filet!  Garlic infused mushrooms that are to die for! And then there is the desert of all desserts! You have not lived in till you have had Mastro's butter cake!!! I've been to master this many times but had never made room for dessert. Oh my gosh! This last time, we were so happy we did! There is always room for the butter cake from now on! Absolutely out of this world, and just difficult to explain... just order it! Also, the coffee was wonderful and I am a coffee snob! I recommended this place without hesitation.

86	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	"I've been to Mastro's restaurants many times before but finally got around to posting a review. Of the locations in Arizona, Ocean Club is my favorite because I'm a big fan of seafood. Plus, this one is less than 15 minutes away from our house. Service is always stellar and I believe our server was Giuseppe last night.

Came here last night with colleagues to celebrate the anniversary of establishing the company. We started our meals with some crab cakes and shrimp cocktails. The crab cakes are 2 to an order and are big enough to share. I wish I had taken pictures of the food but I didn't want to be 'that person'. One person ordered the lobster bisque, another a Caesar salad.

Our table also shared a few bottles of the Jordan Cabernet from Alexander Valley. I didn't partake in drinking last night though because I had a headache going into dinner but I do know I enjoy that wine.

For our main entrees, one person ordered the chopped salad. The others - filet mignon and the porterhouse steak. A coworker and I ordered the chilean seabass and everyone enjoyed their meals very much. I honestly can't remember what they called the preparation of my dish, but I know it had breadcrumbs on top. It was perfect. I always get chilean sea bass at steakhouses. Unfortunately, my boyfriend missed out on this meal so he wasn't there for me to pick steak off his plate (which I always do). I did get a bite of the porterhouse and it just melted in my mouth.

Side dishes that we ordered: lobster mashed potatoes (because you're a fool if you don't get it), sauteed mushrooms, creamed corn, and baked potato (it was huuuuuge). We were honestly so stuffed but we managed to have enough room for dessert. There was no debate - we got 2 butter cakes to share. The butter cake at the Mastro's restaurants are pure heaven. With a nice carmelized crusted outside and a big scoop of vanilla ice cream on top, it only gets better when you spoon a large dollop of their whipped cream. This dessert I did get a picture of. My sweet tooth was satisfied :)"	2

I have been to the ones in Vegas and Laguna beach a few times, and the food, drinks and service have been consistently great at all locations. This Mastro's has one of the most lively scenes, and it was packed to the gills. The crabcake, and the swordfish were excellent. I really like their cocktail menu, and wine list, which are fairly similar to the other locations. While crowded and a bit loud, it was a fun place to go, and will definitely go back next time I get to the area.	1

My husband got the bone-in filet and I got the king crab legs. He ordered the wedge salad and I had the chopped salad. We had the sugar snap peas and scalloped potatoes as sides. Even though he asked for the filet as medium, it came medium rare. He didn't mind. I had a bite and while it was very tender, I would have sent it back for more cooking. My king crab legs were fantastic. Perfectly cooked - not too salty or too watery. The sugar snap peas were crisp and the scalloped potatoes were very rich. 

Our server was spot on until we finished our meal. She was being attentive to a large table, but we were ignored for a good 10-15 minutes once our entree dishes were cleared. This is the reason I didn't give 5 stars. 

I think this is a great place to go for a special occasion dinner. We're not the only ones who think that because the restaurant was packed in early January."	0

We had six at our table, most of whom ordered the sea bass. One of the six felt it was oddly slim cut and dried out. I got mine blackened and it was delicious. Calamari was nicely done. Salads were fine. Wine list is decent.

Main complaint: wide open space, really loud and not good for conversation. Our waiter had so many tables he could only allow us a very limited amount of attention. What do you expect for a minimum of $100/ person?"	1

5 star food. It's an unbelievable experience. Get the rib eye steak (it's 22 oz though so come huuuungry) and get the lobster mashed potatoes. The steak literally melts off your fork and into your mouth. The baked mac and cheese is also out of this world. I couldn't finish my plate because I had a skin tight outfit on and didn't want a belly, but next time I am coming in a big sweater and pigging out.

Both times that we've been here the ambiance was enhanced with live music - which was great.  My only complaint is that it's a 'place to be seen' in the bar area - so it's tough to grab a drink and chat before dinner because it is SO crowded.  If you want a popular place to meet singles or go for a 'night out', hit the bar here.  We usually stick to the restaurant area and we love the food and service.  Just be prepared for the party crowd in the bar!	0
110	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	1	0	5	"What isn't there to like about Ocean Club? I'd like to start off by saying this review is for the bar only. I'd rate the restaurant a little lower at about 3.5 or 4 stars. The bar is amazing. There is good live piano music and the cocktails are so good - might even be my favorite place for drinks in Scottsdale. Not only are the cocktails great, but the wine list is super extensive and you cannot go wrong with almost any choice.

It frustrates me when people review restaurant on yelp based on the drinks, so I want to clarify that Ocean Club not only has 5 star drinks it has 5 star food. The oysters are probably my favorite in all of Arizona, they are cleaned very well and always fresh, and how can you go wrong when they are accompanied by pretzel bread and garlic toasts!? The salads are also nice to have as well as the shrimp cocktail (they are more like little lobsters). The best thing on the menu thought? The Mac and cheese!!! 

You can't go wrong spending a Saturday night with a drink and some light food at the bar at Ocean Club. 

My only warning: it is an older crowd. So if that is something that turns you off, it might not be for you."	4

113	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	1	4	5	"Love, love, love, love, this place. It can be a bit busy and stuffy at times, but none of that matters.

The pretzel bread is hot and ready to shove into my mouth, the drinks and wine selections are on the level with any other steak house...and the steaks are excellent...however...what separates this place from the others are the sides and the completely unassuming desert.

I have frequented this location and also the one in Vegas at the crystals mall (Aria) quite a bit. Both are excellent and consistent and service is second to none, absolute first class staff. 

Back to the important part, the sides. You MUST get the lobster mashed potatoes. It isnt a question or recommendation, you MUST get them. I don't care if you have to continuously shoot yourself in the neck with an eppie pen or run a drip IV to eat it, you come here, you eat it, you leave happy. 

As with any first class establishment, they'll pretty much make you anything you want, as we recently discovered at the Vegas location, they will make you Lobster mac and cheese...hell, they'd probably even put it in the waiters shoes, put a bib on you and spoon feed you if that's what it took to keep you happy. I haven't tested that theory yet, but, I imagine stranger requests have been made at the Vegas location.

Now on to dessert. Oh shit. There is nothing in life that could ever prepare you for the decadence of what I am going to say next. Butter Cake. It sounds like some kind of slurr, like everything was great butt'er cake. But I am fucking dead serious. You eat here, you order the butter cake, and you will never look at dessert the same way again. They bring that bad mother fucker out with a huge helping of freshly made whip cream. This whip cream is not to be confused with some cool-whip in a can shit, its freshly made with HEAVY fucking cream. I am telling you, this cream must be made with some kind of heavy molecular weight element because that shit comes out and scoops like ice cream but remains surprisingly light and delicious. 

I don't care how full you are, even if you feel like you are about to burst, you will try one bite of the butter cake and that glutenous masterpiece will create its own void in your gut to fit in as much as you can possibly eat. They could do scientific analysis on the limits of the human stomach with how much this acts and an interrupt between your stomach and brain converting the full signals to FEED ME MOAR BUTTER CAKE signals. 

The long story short, yes, it is good and if you take anyone here who even remotely has food preferences, they will marry your ass on the spot."	1

There is something wonderful about deliberately leaving your Southern Calif. coastal community in late August and going to Scottsdale Arizona during her off season.  Everything is open and everything is available.   And Mastro's never disappoints. 

The service levels are so superior that the food pales in comparison.   Every moment is attended to with grace and professional courtesy.  

Dinner was a ""made to order"" surf and turf split between the two of us.  They even split the steak and cook ours to order, his rare and mine medium.   The lobster was sweet and moist.  The creamed corn and creamed spinach beyond compare.  Everything was done with our intent in mind.   

Only small flaw was the Creme Brulee.  Our server highly recommended the butter cake and I think we should have listened.   It seemed as though the Brulee was made earlier in the day and sat in the refrigerator.   The caramelized sugar was too cold to have been made to order. 

The wine list was a little more limited than my expectations but was quickly relieved with a reserve list upon order. 

And a phone call the following day to thank us for visiting. 

It get's no better than this. 

Thank you!"	1

My waiter, Michael was very entertaining and attentive. 

The tuna tartare appetizer was very large and it was very high quality.

The Boston chowder was good, i take off a point for too much bacon and not enough clams.

The Mediterranean Bronzino was perfectly prepared and totally delicious.

I tried some of their famous butter cake, it was as a good of a desert that I have ever tried, just too full to eat much of it.

The food is out of this world if your ever in a party if 4 or more I recommend getting the seafood tower it's enough to feed 7 or if you want something individual I highly recommend the steak or specialty of the night, the dessert is a perfect way to finish off the night you can order the butter cake which is irresistible and the atmosphere is really good it's not boring it's buzzing all the time	1

They had a live band so it was noisy but the energy was awesome. When coming to a place like this we know everything is going to be expensive but it is worth every penny.

We started with the calamari which was seasoned and cooked nicely. I ordered the king crab and a side of mac n cheese. My husband ordered the porter house and garlic mashed potatos. 

Best king crab I've had so far! And I have eaten a lot of king crab in my day! No need for butter and they'll crack it for you!  The porterhouse was so awesome, you could cut it with a butter knife. Tender, juicy, and flavorful. The sides are a good portion for sharing and we had plenty to take home for the next day.

Service was amazing at every point and it was a night to remember! 5 stars for sure."	0

Everything about the place is top-notch and the ambiance for date-night is even better near the piano bar.  If you want a cozy, intimate and very well serviced restaurant this is the gem.  Full service bar and a great place for mini-macro meetings for those clients that want the very best.  Amazing staff and the food is above and beyond.

121	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	We usually try to make it to Maestros when we are in Scottsdale. It is pricey but oh so delicious. We like to sit in the bar area to hear the live music and watch the people. We started off with oysters in the half shell. The blue point bay oysters were delicious. They serve a variety of breads in a basket, my hands down favorite is the pretzel bread. Be careful, if you eat too many you won't enjoy your dinner. The roasted Brussel sprouts were served sizzling in a saucepan that was put under the broiler for a minute to get that light char flavor. I had the seared ahi sashimi which was served in a light teriyaki type glaze. Although it was a large serving it was a little salty due to the Cajun rub. My husband had the Chilian Sea Bass which was fresh and baked to perfection with a golden crust.  He said it was the best fish he has ever had. The peachtini was a generous 2 glass serving at $18 and delicious served in a chilled glass with a twist of orange. Overall a wonderful dinner with excellent seafood.	0

As such, everything was planned out to the nines before our arrival. Since it was held at Kierland Resort, we just had to cross the street and *boom!* we were there.

Plenty of staff were on hand with champagne and wine for us all for a little social hour before being formally seated for dinner. It was a family style dinner with a waiter to serve every part of the meal to us each.  We had a selection of soup or salad for our appetizer and the meat for our main course and the dessert selection. TBH There was no bad selection on the menu. Most memorable? My wedge salad, the calamari, the mashed potatoes, and key lime pie. My one suggestion would be to keep the lighting up and not so dim in the evening."	1

124	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	This is my favorite seafood restaurant and one of my favorite restaurants. I've been going to the Ocean Club in Scottsdale since 2007 and fortunately the quality of the food and service has not changed despite the change in ownership. For my recent visit on Dec 27, we had the petition filet, scallops, swordfish and the Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna done sashimi style. Our server, Duke, was fabulous. He is very professional and unobtrusive. He has been working at the Ocean Club since it opened. If you get to sit in his area, you'll be in for a great experience. There is a Mastro's Steakhouse in DC area (where I live) but I think an Ocean Club will give the other seafood-centric restaurants a run for their money.	0
125	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	We've had Mike as our waiter at least a dozen times and yet every time we have him I find myself in quiet awe. I forget to request his section but luckily we seem to end up there. My wife and I have friends that visit us annually and he remembered my friends order from one year ago and the specificity of his order. He mentioned something that had happened the year prior. We had never had this discussion with him prior. Mike is simply the best waiter I have ever had anywhere. If you catch the subtle things he does you will be impressed as well. The food is always good here, this place isn't my favorite as far as the food. That's not to say I don't enjoy it. I definitely do. The bartenders do an adequate job for sure. If you go ask for Mike as your waiter. I don't know his last name but he is the gentleman with the beard and the deep voice. Thank you Mike, you make the Ocean Club better than it might be otherwise.	0

The music was great. The constant Casanovas slithering by was ridiculous. This is a great establishment to take a date to, but single women sitting at the bar beware. 

I had the shrimp martini and the chopped salad which were both very enjoyable. The Ketel One and cran was to my liking.  Not a fan of being picked up on while I eat. But hey, you can't blame a man for trying, right?"	2

Everything here was really good, the food definitely fits the ambiance and the excellent level of service. The sides, the appetizers, and the entrees are all excellent. I'm pretty sure the sides are huge as well. The only strong memory I remember from Ocean Club is my halibut entree, which is somewhat unfortunately. While the grilling was spot on, for some reason I found my fillet lacked flavor, whether that be from the fish or the lack of seasoning I have no idea.

If it weren't for being jealous of everyone else's entrees, I probably would've given Maestro's a 5 star review. It's classy and it's affordable, I highly recommend it."	1

I do consider myself a foodie and have dined at some of the best restaurants in North America and Ocean Club ( Scottsdale ) remains my favourite.

I have been dinning here for approximately 8 years now and they have never disappointed me. 

Some of my favourites are :
The filet mignon
The clear lobster roll
Lobster mashed potatoes 

The service 

The live music 

If you have been to any of Mastro's restaurants in other cities do not let that 
be your deciding factor. I have been to most and there is no other like Scottsdale.

I cannot say enough about this restaurant.
Absolutely the best steakhouse and sea food restaurant

We had caviar as an appetizer, which was served with fluffy delicious blinis and all the wonderful accompaniments. My hubby had the filet mignon and he said it was very good, I had the Chilean sea bass and it was incredible! We shared a side of lobster mashed potatoes which had large chunks of lobster in them, so good!! Last but not least, you have to end your meal with their signature warm butter cake and coffee, it was the best cake I've ever had! It was all well worth the money for a such a special occasion. Their lounge is fun with live music while you wait for your table, make sure to make reservations in advance.	1

My boyfriend had NY strip, chefs cut which was so big he could not finish it (he has never left anything on his plate). We did half salads and the amazing mussels. And everything was perfect. To finish it off they brought me their famous butter cake. I typically do not eat dessert, but this was way too amazing to pass up. Thanks for the great experience, we will be back!	0

We ended up taking my Brother-in-Law to dinner for graduating Law School. I had a reservation for 7:45 and after checking in with the hostess we were seated shortly after.

Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and described their evening specials. He was assisted by another waitress that never let our beverages get below half full. You can tell that these servers take their job very seriously and want to make you feel very comfortable. They will make any exception on making you happy and satisfied.

We started off with ordering shrimp cocktails and beef carpaccio. The shrimp cocktail is accompanied with cocktail sauce and this amazing atomic horseradish. This is the kind of horseradish that will clear your sinuses and make your eyes water. I love this stuff, even though it burns it makes you come back for more. The beef carpaccio was also very good and was served with mix greens and toast.

Ocean Club also starts you off with bread basket that is filled with a variety of breads from pretzel to sourdough.

For my main entree I decided to go with the fillet Mignon cooked medium. The steak came out sizzling hot and melted in your mouth. This has got to be one of the best steaks I have ever had. My brother-in-law ordered the swordfish which he said was amazing.

We ordered a side of their lobster mashed potatoes and sauteed broccoli. The lobster mashed were loaded with lobster meat and butter......to die for. 

For dessert, I finished with my after dinner drink of choice....Sambuca and we ordered the butter cake. This cake has the perfect balance of salty and sweet and is cooked to perfection with crispy edges and a moist center. The cake is served with vanilla ice cream and a huge plate of fresh whipped cream.

Overall, this is an amazing restaurant. The service, food and ambiance is the ingredients to a perfect meal. Ocean Club is not cheap but you are paying for an amazing experience. I don't mind paying the extra money when they deliver such a great product.

The atmosphere and service surpasses the food.  They serve a great basked of bread, but for me, they can skip everything but the pretzel bread. #addicted.

I had a tasty dirty martini, made to perfection.  For food, we started with the Seafood Tower. We picked crab, lobster and a few others.  That was where we could have stopped and been full but didn't.  I had a petite cut and it was cooked to perfection.

144	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	The most amazing seafood I've ever had other than what I've had in Hawaii and parts of California. Blueberry Martini - to die for. Crab cakes - a must. Butter cake - heavenly. If you have a party if at least four or more - splurge and get the seafood tower! Service is just what you'd expect from this restaurant chain - five star all the way. All seafood is flown in fresh every day. I miss being able to eat here!	0
145	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	"A client gave me a $250 gift card to Mastro's or else we never would have gone someplace like this. I read all the Yelp reviews and quickly got very nervous.  People either loved or hated Ocean Club. Filter out the ones that complain about the noise though - they were obviously sitting in the lounge, which was super loud.  We sat in the dining room and it was restaurant-quiet the entire time.  But even after filtering out the noise complaints and the people who obviously had an axe to grind with a particular server, the remaining bad reviews were about the food.  This concerned me greatly.  If you're going to pay that much, the food better be delicious and cooked to perfection.  I can tell you that our entire was just that.

Our reservation was at 5pm which is when the dining room opens. Everyone was super friendly and professional starting with the check-in people. We got a nice table by one of the huge windows and a view of the other shops.  The trees outside had christmas lights which turned on at 5:30 and then about 6pm they opened the windows.  

Our server was attentive, professional & courteous.  I cannot stress how incredible the service was.  Our waiter walked us through the menu and instantly many of the questions that had been bugging me were answered.  They started us with a bread basket which had normal rolls, garlic toast wedges and pretzel bread.  I could have eaten an entire dinner of just the pretzel bread.  We love shrimp cocktail and even though Mastro's is famous for it's Seafood Tower, there was no way the two of us could eat that AND have dinner so we just got the $23 shrimp cocktail...which was the coolest thing ever.  4 tasty, mammoth shrimp as big as my hand with spicy, but not-too-spicy cocktail sauce, served over dry ice so the smoke filtered over the table.  My wife got the $8 Small Chopped Salad which she loved and I got the $12 Boston Clam Chowder which was as good or better than any clam chowder I've ever had.  We came for the seafood but my wife wanted a steak.  Our waiter suggested getting the Filet Oscar-style, stuffed with Dungeness Crab and Bearnaise sauce.  Even though the prices seemed astronomical, this was our anniversary and my wife happily agreed.  The 8oz Filet was $51 and the Dungeness Crab topping was another $32.  That's $83 for one steak.  We couldn't believe it....until she tasted it.  It was cooked perfectly with huge chunks of crab in and over it.  I was almost wishing I had gotten the same thing until I dug into my 1lb King Crab Legs for $67.  Ever so briefly, I was a little dissapointed when they came out and saw there were only 2 legs.  Then I saw how massive they were.  Delicious with a hint of sweetness I've never tasted in crab legs before.  

The sides are a-la-cart, and come in 2 sizes - Small or Family.  Our waiter suggested the small sizes for us, which I kind of doubted but was proven wrong.  It was nice that he didn't try to get us to order more than we needed as a few other reviewers experienced.  We got the $20 Lobster Mashed Potatoes which are their signature side, and well worth it.  The lobster was wonderful and not at all chewy like other reviewers experienced.  We also got the $8 Gorgonzolla Mac & Cheese which came out on a skillet and perfectly baked.  The last side was the $7 Grilled Asparagus.  Everything was amazing.  

My wife got Diet Coke and they bring it out in the little 12oz bottles.  She went through 4 of them at $5 a piece and we couldn't have cared less.  The wait staff was incredibly attentive.  Drinks never got more than halfway finished before being refilled.  

Our waiter told us he had a complimentary chocolate cake for us but we told him we also had to try the $16 Warm Butter Cake which was huge, with an equally huge scoop of vanilla ice cream and caramel drizzle.  We must have spent a good 30 minutes on the butter cake alone.

For a full dinner you've got to prepare yourself for at least a 2 hour dining experience.  Possibly longer with alcohol and coffee.  We were there 2 hours and honestly it flew by.  Our water told us it would be 25 minutes between soup/salad and entree and it was, but it didn't feel like it at all.  

The bill came to $295.39 with the comped chocolate cake and after the $250 gift card, $45.39. We always tip at least 20% no matter where we go so we added a $65 tip for a total of $110.39.  That's just under what we routinely spend on our anniversary dinner at The Salt Cellar.  So for us, in this instance, it worked out perfect.

So I'm forced to ask myself if I would feel the same way with a $350 bill.  It's hard to answer that, because I would never pay $300+ for a dinner for 2.  And if I wanted to, my wife would have a very hard time with it.  So - no, I do not think it was worth $350 for a normal dinner.  But that's not the point, it wasn't a normal dinner.  It was a very special occasion dinner.  Will we do it again next year?  Probably not.  Maybe for our 25th anniversary though."	3

150	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	"No question this is a popular Scottsdale spot.  At 6:30 on a recent Saturday night, it was popping!!  The place was packed and not with just wealthy Scottsdale retirees, either.  There was a good mix of families (my Gawd!  You'd have to be super rich to feed mom & dad and four kids here), middle-age folks, older couples, and a slew of the beautiful folks packed into the bar area.  Unfortunately, all those people produced a noise level that, despite acoustical dampening efforts like room divider drapes, carpets, table clothes, and upholstered chairs, made it extremely difficult to carry on a conversation across the table.  Plus, it is so dark in there the waiter passes out mini-flashlights so you can read the menu.

We all thought the food was well above average, although my grilled halibut was as dry a piece as I've ever had.  A little drier and it would have been inedible. I frequently order halibut at restaurants and when I can get a nice piece at the fishmongers, cook it at home.  None has ever been as dry as this piece was.  My wife had the ahi sashimi style and her dinner was excellent.  Another in our party had the sea bass which she loved, and two others had red meat and both thought their food was very good.

Our server was Cole and he was not only pleasant and friendly, he was very knowledgeable about the food and the wines.  He was one of the best servers we've had anywhere in recent years.  He nicely explained that their side plates are very large and we could either split one between two or more people or order half plates.  That was very nice and helped keep the bill down.  Plus, he comped our table a huge piece of their fabulous chocolate cake and their delicious  rum cake because one member of our party was celebrating a birthday.  How great was that?

My only real negative about this restaurant is the poor plate presentation.  The chopped wedge salad (think about that oxymoron for a minute) was just chopped romaine and other items on a small square plate.   It didn't look any better than what I make myself at home. There was also no blue cheese dressing that I could discern but it was so dark at the table it might have been on there, but I never tasted any dressing. .  When the entrees were brought to the table my piece of fish was sitting on a large plate all by its lonesome.  Nothing else adorned the plate!  No parsley, no decorative drizzle of sauce, no nothing.  The sea bass and the two steaks were the same way.  In fact, the piece of sea bass looked just like a large dinner roll sitting on a large plate.  All of the entrees were just plopped down on a plate with no attention to detail.  Gees, when I pay nearly 50 bucks for a hunk of fish you'd think the least they could do was make the plate look nice.  The only reason my wife's ahi looked the best was because it came on a bed of shredded carrots with a pile of shaved ginger.

I know this review won't have much impact on this place as they do a killer business, but for the amount of money we spent in there you'd think that they could take a little effort to spruce up the appearances of their food presentations.  We do eat with our eyes, after all!"	0

Neither her or I do seafood but steaks all the way. 

Got the 8oz filet, medium. It came out pretty rare but luckily the plate is hotter than an oven so I cut it open all over and pushed it around the plate. Became perfect. 

Got a 4 stars cuz the filet had some grizzle on it and the buttercake seemed like it was sitting out for a bit, not hot like usual. 

Still a very good meal but ill stick to city hall"	1

I ordered the chopped salad which was super yummy. They have steak as well but I think their veggies are pretty good. I liked the atmosphere more so than the food at this place. There was a piano player and singer and it just reminded me of another time period. It's an older establishment too. I went there a few years ago as well and the crowd was mostly in the 40-50 age range so no annoying college kids was a welcome change. The crowd was still that same age group when I came back recently. 

The drinks are great too. This is the place to meet up, get a little dressy (always a plus and something I'm up for ) and listen to music.  The food is good I preferred the appetizers to the main course options though."	0

We had an excellent waiter who was very informative and friendly. The bread basket arrived, and it had a huge assortment of flavors in there -- pretzel bread, garlic cheese crisps, etc. Just amazing! Between the 3 of us, we ordered 2 cuts of fish, a steak, and 2 sides. They first gave us each sizzling hot plates with some oil on it for eating off of. Nice presentation. The sides are served family style and are meant to be shared. We opted for the creamed corn and steamed asparagus. Both were delicious and cooked to perfection! We had a petit filet, and they had sliced it up for us to share. It was perfectly pink in the center. Their fish is served very simply, with just the cut of fish for presentation, no add-ons. We had their signature Chilean Sea Bass and Alaskan Halibut. Our server said each fish dish can be served 5 different ways (grilled, pan-seared, etc.), but he recommended that for white fish, it be cooked method #5. Can't recall exactly but it involves some herbs and seasoning. Both the sea bass and the halibut were cooked that way, and they came out scrumptious! They had sliced each piece 3 ways for easy sharing for us, which was very nice. And to round off the meal, we had checked-in on yelp so got a free warm butter cake for dessert! It's normally worth $15! I highly recommend this restaurant for fine dining!	0
157	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	2	0	5	Just had one of the best meals of my life! The hubby and I ordered the Wagu boned in ribeye along with a lobster roll served with sugar snap peas. The meat was tender and tasty and the sushi was amazing as well, we loved the combination along with our wine. For dessert we shared the butter cake which was a HUGE plate of pure indulgence. The service was too notch, the restrooms were clean, the ambiance was elegant and romantic. They opened the windows as the sun set and allowed the fresh breeze in. We felt like we were really taken care of. Our server, Patrick, was friendly and knowledgeable. Can't wait to come back again! Wish we didn't live in the snowy tundra of Wisconsin! It truly was a 5 star experience!	1

All four of us ordered steaks and they all were cooked to perfection. The mac n cheese (a favorite of mine) and the asparagus were the perfect sides and of course, how could I have forgotten the pretzel bread to start (delish!) 

I just have one minor complaint. I always order the petite filet and, in the past, it was always an 8 oz for $40. However, I guess Mastros just started selling the petite filet in a 6oz (trust me, the 2 extra oz make a huge difference when it comes to filling up your stomach). You can order the 8oz for, I dont know, I think $10+ -, which is the smallest complaint. But I mean, I'm already paying $40 ... why should I have to pay an extra $10 for what I normally always get?? 

Anywho... we all thoroughly enjoyed our meal and will be back without question."	2

We tried the shrimp cocktail for a starter and were warned about the horseradish.  WOW the shrimp was fantastic and the horseradish was amazing. The bread was very tasty. We tried the scallops and they were quite possibly the best I've ever had.  We also had the filet and it was cooked to perfection.  For sides we had the sautéed wild mushrooms. They were amazing.

170	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	Ok it's seriously expensive for steaks and veggies covered with butter and salt.     But let's get serious, people go here for the SCENE.     Weekends have many good looking people, though it can be a wait to sit.     It's usually at least half cougars but half 30s age group.     The bartenders and wait staff are very good, which makes you feel better about spending 200 a person for a night of dinner and drinks.   Maybe Jess if you drink less.      Decor is nice, and the live music is usually good.    Scottsdale is short on high style places so these guys are a rarity, but you pay for it.	0

173	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Absolutely perfect in every way.  We spotted this place when we were first checking out the Phoenix area before we lived here.  Since it's a bit pricey we said to ourselves, this is where we will come after we move here and have something special to celebrate.  And that we did last night. I was a little concerned after reading some reviews about the busy-ness and it was a Friday night after all.  So I half expected we may be disappointed.  But, between being sat within a few minutes of our arrival, being greeted by the staff, taking our initial drink order, etc ... everyone and everything arrived in a timely and very professional and presentable manner.  In the lounge area, there IS a band playing and for us, we would prefer a bit more quiet as it was difficult at times to hear each other or our waiter.  But, the food and the service more than made up for any slight hearing impairment.  Expect to pay.  Drinks are $20.  My 2lb Lobster was $70 ... etc... but my God ... the food was AMAZING!  Filling and delicious.  The service was absolutely impeccable.  They will bend over backward to make sure you are happy.  I would definitely come back here often if budget permitted.  It's really some of the best food I've ever had.  The Shrimp and Crab Cocktail ... Best ever.  We also ordered two sides:  The Roasted Brussels Sprouts and the Sweet Mashed Potatoes.  Better than Thanksgiving.  My husband had steak ... he said it was awesome. I enjoyed the Lemon Berry Martini ... Yum.  And then ended the night with Chocolate covered strawberries.    This place definitely left a lasting impression and we will be back!	0

Lobster mashed potatoes, Lobster mashed potatoes, Lobster mashed potatoes. The best thing you can order, I swear. You have to order this if you are a fan of mashed potatoes.
 If you like a little spice.. the jalepeno tuna sashimi. Its the highest quality fish I've had and its got a mild spice to it. delicious.

Heirloom tomatoes - ok, but I would pass on this
Sea Bass - very good, but not spectacular
Vanilla battered sole - very good w massive portion (4 large pieces) and yummy tartar sauce

I was with a very large group that challenged the kitchen. The kitchen was clearly stressed after apps were served, but the blackened tuna and perfect calamari were served spot on! The best calamari I have ever had. I could have left completely satisfied after having this dish!

However, blackened Mahi mahi was also in our future.....

Our table was served much later than others in the group, and we had to get the attention of wait-staff when one diner wasn't served at all. They quickly responded. The fish was cooked very well, and I enjoyed the creamed corn and broccoli sides, but thought all could have been kicked up a notch with seasoning or topping."	2

The service was amazing and the food was great and timed perfectly. We started with blue point oysters and jumbo shrimp cocktail. It was phenomenal. We continued with a filet and family sides. The whole experience was delightful. Unexpectedly the next day, Ocean Club called me and thanked me for dining with them! I have dined at City Hall many times and never received an after call. I will continue to go to Ocean Club!	1

If you order a mixed drink, such as a gin and tonic - you will get a gin on the rocks with perhaps a 1/2 inch of room for tonic, which is provided in a separate bottle. Talk about a good pour!

191	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	9	9	5	"Standing on a rooftop, I shout ""I absolutely love Mastro's Ocean Club!""  It's my absolute favorite place to dine when visiting Scottsdale.  I've been 4 times, for business and for pleasure (even though this makes it one of the same, 100% pleasure).

The bar is beautiful, reminds me of an Absolute ad of color and things stacked atop of another magnificently, hence that's why I used ABSOLUTE so much.  I can go on and on about Mastro's, the seafood is terrific, and they even have wonderful steaks.  I have heard about the ship to shore to restaurant process, and it's nothing short of phenomenal. 

But what I really want to focus your attention on two things, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and incredible, awe inspiring, Seafood Tower.  Focus, FOCUS!

First, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes: creamy, lobstery, and the most perfect mashed potatoes you can imagine (I think they are buttery, too).  They will leave in a state of bliss.  They go perfect with anything you order, seafood and meat dish.  I absolutely adore this.

Second, and without a doubt, the most outstanding thing on the menu, the Seafood Tower.  I've had it small (3-4 items), and I've it large (7-8 items), but I get it each and every time I go to MOC.  They clear the table, fast before your eyes.  Then, they bring out the monstrosity, a tower, 2/3/4 tiers depending on how much is ordered for how many, and the thing is smoking.  Literally.  Served on dry ice (and regular), it's a feast for king.  You have your choice from snow crab claws, crab legs, blue crab, oysters on the half shell, lobster cocktails, jumbo shrimp, lobster tails, among others.  Each and every selection is the freshest thing you can have.  I love it.  I would make sweet love to it!  It's pricey, but worthy of making credit card payments.

It's a chain, I know, but the food and service has always been outstanding."	13

193	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	I'm basing this review on only a single visit. That said, we had a pretty good experience at Mastro's: quick seating despite a relatively crowded restaurant and no reservations. The table ordered a mix of steak and fish dishes. Mine, the Sashimi-style Ahi tuna was fresh, well prepared and well cooked. Steaks came sizzling hot and sides, while maybe note quite as big as the waiter described, were excellent and big enough to share. The highlight was probably the butter cake desert: awful for you, I'm sure, but melt-in-your mouth delicious. Recommended.	0

I am used to paying $15 but these cost $20... but served tableside with a generous pour...   The menu has good choices. Friends had Chilean sea bass which they liked. My wife spent $35 on fois gras which was great.  My $56 bone in ribeye seemed expensive but was great.  The Brussels sprouts, green beans and scalloped potatoes were excellent at $13 each.  The $12 crisp was appreciated. As I said, expensive but all very good. I found an unusual and amazingly low priced petite sirah on the wine list. We got it. We liked it. I was disillusioned that the ""computer"" added $20 to the price. It was corrected but I shouldn't have had to catch it. Should you have dinner here?  As a Ugandan friend said years go (in a different context), how heavy is your pocket?  This place is really good but expensive, which has been my experience at other Mastro's restaurants. If you aren't price sensitive, check it out. If you are on a budget you will find it stressful.  For us, it was good. We don't do it every night."	0
196	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	5 star should be enough said but I will say everything about our visit on a simple Monday evening was absolute perfection. During our wait for our dining table in the lounge I found myself having a difficult time choosing a cocktail from their extensive list with a lengthy variety of cocktails but the live music was a nice bonus. I ended up with the Elder Flower Martini and the $19 cocktail ended up being an extremely generous portion including leaving the remainder amount in the shaker for me to enjoy which ended up bring another entire martini. I highly recommend our table as it was completely open to the outdoors with fabulous weather and a beautiful night view of the Tommy Bahama building with all the green and beautifully lit trees. The Australian Wagu beef was perfectly prepared and definitely enough for two. The sides were filled with flavor. Our concierge from our resort had our server send over their famous butter cake which we knew we were never going to be able to finish. However, one bite in and we were hooked, this cake alone is worth returning for and we will absolutely do that. Do not forget to top it with the homemade Chantilly cream. Oh my!!!!!	0

We shared some appetizers, oysters, tuna tartar and the beef carpaccio.  They were great, I would recommend the tuna as it was amazing!  Followed by a ribeye grilled to a perfect medium!!  The steak came out sizzling on a 400 degree plate!  We also shared some side, mushrooms, scalloped potato and some asparagus.  The sides were alright but I'd have to say that this steak was probably one of the best I've ever had!!  Highly recommend this restaurant!!	0
198	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	3	10	4	"Hit up the Ocean Club for a work dinner with a bunch of others after a conference. Despite being in located in a mall and being a small chain, I had a good experience at Mastro's.

Liked:
+The wine list which was predictably extensive and expensive. Look closer and there are ""some"" decent values like a French Cremant at $10/glass for a generous pour
+My steak was very tender and flavorful. Even the ""petite"" filet is 8oz which ended up being quite large.

Indifferent To:
~I honestly thought the Butter Cake was ""meh"" - it was just too....unctuous I guess. I should expect that given the name but it just wasn't my jam. I was the exception because my party demolished that thing.
~The service is professional, with requisite white ""steakhouse waiter"" jackets. I could do without the clearly rehearsed patter though and I don't need to be reminded that medium on a steak is a ""warm red center"".

Disliked:
-Attendants in the restroom. I don't always bring my handbag with me and it's just awkward all the way around. No.
-Tables are way, way, way too close together. I shouldn't have to ask the person next to me to slide out so I can get up.

The crowd here is definitely interesting, especially once the (terrible) band gets going. Lots of spangly Chico's clad older ladies on the prowl and lots of on-the-third-divorce Regional Sales Managers."	3

The calamari, caesar salad and steak options are all great. And theres enough space between the tables that its fairly quiet and you can have a conversation with others at your table.

The live music was good to hear and still allowed conversation.   I had the Mahi mahi and my buddy ordered the swordfish.  The meal was fantastic and nearly as impressive as the extensive bourbon list.  I'm not one to request specific servers, but Andy would be an exception.  Funny and friendly made for a enjoyable experience.  Kudos to the chef and Andy.	1

When we had problems deciding on our sides (because we wanted so many) he split them into smaller portions so we could order more variety. His drink selections were right on the money and exactly as described. Our appetizers and desserts were the perfect size. The food was perfectly cooked, perfectly timed and delicious.  Thanks for a great night!	0

I always order the same: -oysters (Kumamoto) and shrimp cocktail (huge and delicious) with lots of fresh horse radish. 

- sometimes I get the clam chowder which is amazing but I have to say it's very buttery and heavy.

- bone in steak. I always order the small one with a side of veggies.

I don't usually like sweets but you can't get out of there without trying the Butter Cake desert! 

This Mastro's has so far the best live music, usually some blonde girl that sings really good and a guy at the piano. And the staff is extra friendly."	0

Our drinks were perfect and the atmosphere was relaxing.

My husband and I decided to eat appetizers. I had the Best crab cake anywhere! Filled with so much crab and just the right combo of filling. One crab cake comes with avocado on the side and it was a meal for me. My husband was disappointed in the Vanilla Crusted Shrimp because it was a lot of crust. The prawn was good though. Give it a 3.

Their signature warm butter cake was the most decadent, delicious dessert! Fresh fruit on the side, ice cream on top and a side of rich, fluffy whipped cream. My husband & I thought that was something we would not eat, but we finished off everything! Definitely a dessert to share with 2 or more. Fantastic=5!"	0

This past weekend we ordered the Oyster's Rockefeller to start with and they were as delicious as always. For our entrees, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my boyfriend ordered the Filet Oscar Style - both dishes were amazing. Spinach and mushroom sides were also very good - this place is exceptional. For dessert we shared the key lime pie, and it was surprisingly a large slice - loved it! Usually we get the signature warm butter cake for dessert and it is heavenly. 

Overall, we love Maestros' Ocean Club. The service is always impeccable and then food outstanding. The bar area has live music and is a perfect place to people watch. The dining room on the other side is also very nice and a bit quieter. I would recommend Maestro's Ocean Club to anyone for any occasion or just a regular day."	0
209	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	This restaurant not only meets my standards as far as food goes, but even in the atypical situation where your steak is under done, the solution here is that the plate is so hot it will continue to cook as it sizzles in front of you. The appetizers are brilliant, the main courses exquisite, and the deserts to die for. I do not think the price should scare you away because it really meets the price to the cent. I recommend Mastro's highly to anyone I can.	0

We got there early before the dinner crowd, and finished up some work form our meeting and then enjoyed a glass of wine and dinner.   I'm a vegetarian so I ordered a salad.  Salad was definitely tasty, but my coworker raved about her fish.  She said it was the best she'd ever had.    Sometimes when you read great reviews it leaves space for disappointment, but that was definitely not our experience.  I'd go here again when in Scottsdale."	4

I chose Ocean Club for our main course.  We were greeted promptly by name and seated immediately.  I had stopped by the restaurant earlier in the day to drop off a birthday card and flowers for our table.  Yes a little redundant, but I'm all about going all the way or nothing at all!  At that time I explained that we were having appetizers 1st somewhere else and moving on to another restaurant for dessert. All was well when we were seated, card and orchid in place (whew).  I ordered Swordfish for myself and the bone-in Rib Eye/Crab leg combo for my companion.  I also ordered the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, and the Sautéed Mushrooms.  Our server Lloyd was amazing, treated us as if we were his only guests.  We were not!  Once we were finished, Lloyd had our leftovers boxed and sent us on our way knowing that we had a 3rd reservation waiting.Thank you to Lloyd and Mastro's Ocean Club for making it an amazing mid-course to our evening!!!	0

To start, it is very classy and nice. Beautiful interior décor. Fancy place settings.

The service is wonderful. Very professional and high class. You get what you pay for there.

The food was wonderful. I got salmon of course and loved it!

We told them it was our anniversary as well so they were nice enough to bring us a piece of cake and a candle lit!! So nice of them.  We left there stuffed.

This place is just marvelous. Loved it!! If I could afford to, I would go back every weekend."	1

I decided to leave an updated review because we order a seafood tower this time. We ordered Pacific Coast oysters on half shell, seared ahi tuna, jumbo tiger shrimp, the swordfish and scallops. The fish was cooked perfectly; it pretty much melts in your mouth. The sauce the scallop entree is cooked in is delicious. Oysters were good. Shrimp was HUGE. And the sauce the seared tuna came in was to-die-for. 

All the above was phenomenal. We racked up a pretty high tab including wine and whiskey but every penny was worth it.

Again, I didn't get to the dessert because I was stuffed but one day I will!"	1

222	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	......... I'm speechless... This place is fabulous! I ordered the New York Strip, and they did not disappoint. It was so tender... Usually just the filets are like butter, but believe me, my New York was like cool whip. The staff were fantastic, I believe our waiters name was Patrick... He was so kind and helpful, shoutout to him. We got a few sides and appetizers... We got escargot which was surprisingly good in its garlicky sauce, but I recommend eating with the pastry it comes with. We also ordered the vanilla shrimp which was so plump and fresh and probably some of the best shrimp I've ever had. Our waiter, Patrick, recommended the lobster mashed potatoes, boy was his recommendation on point, it was simply divine. And of course you have to have a green vegetable, so you just couldn't go wrong with steamed broccoli. Then after leisurely eating the main course for about 45 minutes, it was time for dessert... Their specialty is the warm butter cake, which we sadly did not get to experience, instead we devoured the chocolate sin cake. The chocolate was so rich and pure and topped with house made whipped cream and garnished with a mint leaf, but you simply couldn't go wrong with any dessert on the menu. Sadly you can't keep eating all night, it was time to go home with a big doggy bag. Until the next time, I'm sure I won't be disappointed.	1

I would recommend that to start and then head in the direction of steak. Wine list is, of course, expansive and diverse. An excellent experience all in itself.	0
226	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	As usual, the Ocean Club was packed - on a Tuesday night!  My favorite thing about this establishment is the superior training and execution delivered by the staff - from the front to the back of the restaurant. You sense it immediately. And you sense how engaged the staff is in delivering exceptional customer experiences. They move quick, think fast, and don't miss the details - but they still take time to build rapport with each table. And then there's the food!  I ordered a New York Strip, medium rare, that was absolutely marvelous!  The signature seasoning applied to their steaks really sets them and finishes the taste of the fine beef well.  Mastro's know fine dining and they deliver it - every time!	0
227	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	"We all had high expectations for this place and I must admit the expectations were met! Normally I am not a fan of ""steakhouses"" so I was pleased that my parents wanted to go to a seafood/steak place for their 35th wedding anniversary. I've been to City Hall in old town for steaks before and have always been pleased, so I think I knew what to expect from Ocean Club.

We arrived and were seated right away (with reservation on a Sunday night). They have a very large bar area (well known in the area as cougar hunting grounds) which looked nice and fully stocked. I think the bar area is actually larger than the dining room. The cocktails on the menu were expensive, far more expensive that the average for the area (approx $20 each), and they weren't that fantastic. But the wine and beer selection was fairly good.

Now, on to the food - We started with oysters which were SO fresh. I am always hesitant eating any seafood in Arizona (or anywhere landlocked) but you could really taste the ocean. Our server informed us that they fly in their seafood daily so ensure freshness. Not good for my global footprint, but I will accept the freshness none the less. Both the boyfriend and I got steak and lobster tail. I got mine with the small filet (6oz) and it was lovely and cooked perfectly. My boyfriend had the New York cut and seemed to really enjoy it. My father got the Mahi Mahi and also enjoyed it alot, I was surprised at the large portion of the Mahi. They offered to cook it a variety of ways, he chose to have it grilled with lemon. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus on the side. The lobster mashed potatoes had huge pieces of lobster in it, but was under seasoned. In fact, everyone put salt on their steak/fish/sides throughout the evening and we aren't big salt eaters. I suppose I would rather my food under salted vs over salted but you'd think when you pay so much money they would get the balance right for you.

All in all, the service was great, the food was good, and we had an enjoyable celebration. This place is very expensive but I'd say it's worth it for a special occasion."	1
228	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	I have never had a bad meal at Mastro's. We had a table of 20 people and we all order different items and loved them all immensely. I got crab claws and my husband got steak. We also ordered the bacon appetizer as well as the vanilla shrimp. I truly think I'm addicted to the vanilla shrimp. It is unbelievable and so flavorful. The salads and all of the sides are amazing but I have to tell you that their signature dessert (which is a warm butter cake) is the best dessert you will ever eat. My girls got chocolate covered strawberries with the mound of whip cream and those two were extraordinary. Go eat at this restaurant because you will love it!	0

You want to impress the ladies, bring them here to the O bar and enjoy some live music while you order a martini at $20 a pop. Then get the seafood tower for an appetizer, maybe a little side salad. Then order the ribeye, or the New York steak, or the sea bass.  Get the side without sautéed veggies, get them steamed or grilled. Then cash out at about $200. All worth it for sure. Oh yeah, get the butter cake. Then go to the gym the next day and diet for two weeks after.	0

It turned out to be just about the perfect day and time as it was not too busy while also there was enough room for us to have our own space without another occupied table too near us. What can I say? I go for the food. I do not care to listen to other peoples conversations no matter who they are and what they do.

Let's talk food.

OK, that butter cake made me laugh like it had drugs in it. The combo of the warm sweet sugary cake with melting ice cream, fresh strawberries and homemade whipped cream is so good that I'd not be surprise to learn that they secretly added some type of anti-depressants. 

The big surprise was just how crisp, sweet and perfectly delicious the snap peas were. I mean they are only veggies. How wonderful can they get. Well the answer is that they can be out of this world. Biting into one at a time was a carnival of blissful experiences. 

Our server was Eric and he had it down cold. He was experienced and seemed to possess a deep understanding of all food and drink. Eric knew just how to handle each customer in a unique way. I saw him adjust his approach with every table he visited. It is not often that you suspect you were lucky enough to get the best employee in the place. We talked at length with Eric and learned his secret to superior service. He has been a chef, sever, small business owner, etc. With a long and diverse background in food service, we really enjoyed his expertise. This is coming from me and I do not chat about personal stuff with the folks that bring out my food very often. Somehow Eric knew that it was OK on this night to talk with us like we were all old friends and I though it was fun.

My main  course was lobster and it was amazing as expected.

Overall, it was one of my best restaurant experiences in my entire life and I have dined at great spots in NY, Paris, Sedona and Miami.

The price could have been twice as much and I would have paid it with a smile."	0

As for the food, my steak (12oz filet Oscar style) was PERFECT and so were the caesar salad, asparagus, and scalloped potatoes. The wine list was extensive and the service was pretty consistent with other steakhouses but not as good as my recent visit to Fleming's. Bottom line - I would absolutely return to this Mastro's!

I had the Bone-in Filet and the Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese....these are my favorite Mastro dishes.  I sampled the Carpaccio, which was phenomenal....it's soo tender and full of flavor.  For Dessert, we all shared 1,000,000 calories worth of dishes (Buttercake, Key Lime Pie, Chocolate Cake, Whipped Cream)....but it's all good when you're dining in a top notch restaurant with great people.

I forgot to mention that we put away 2 bottles of Wine during dinner and a nice glass of Port at the end of dinner.  A perfect way to end an evening.

Tip - Don't forget that Mastro's is not cheap.  It's a fine dining joint....expect to pay for it.

I came to Mastro's with 14 clients and everyone was raving about the service and the food. 

Patrick gave us excellent descriptions on all the different kinds of shell fish available. He knew what oysters were  more mild than others, where they came from, and he did a great job putting 4 different seafood towers together. I highly recommend the seafood tower if you like shell fish - everything tasted so fresh!

I had the Chilean Sea Bass, and it was the best piece of fish I've ever had! Growing up in New England my whole life, I've had some really good seafood but nothing as good as this Chilean Sea Bass (blackened). 

Everyone else either had the Chilean Sea Bass or some kind of Steak. Everyone loved their food and said the steaks were cooked to perfection. 

 Dining at Masteo's is more than just dinner, it's an experience you won't forget!

I also have to give a shoutout to Tanya, the  event planner. Tanya did an excellent job coordinating our reservations and preparing us for the evening.

During my trips to Arizona I normally frequent the Mastro's Steakhouse, but I decided to switch it up this time.  I couldn't be happier I did!

We ended up getting there early and the place was jammed pack and had live music...It was like part HH, part fine dining...The best of both worlds, I say.  We went to the bar in the back and hung out there until our table was ready.  

Word to the wise, the drinks are expensive, BUT you get a mixer/tumbler that evens it all out.  We ordered two drinks and it came to around $50.  We were like, ""Uhhh, did you accidentally charge us for someone else's drinks, as well?!""  Thankfully, my tasty Cosmo with the mixer/tumbler was like three drinks... 3 Cosmos for ~$25, not a bad deal:-)

All the patrons at the bar were so friendly and chatted with us...there was a hodgepodge of different styles and crowds blended in, but still kept an air of an ""upscale"" spot.  

The food was great...unfortunately, I cannot recall what we had, as we had a variety of dishes and left with our bellies filled to the max.

Shout-out to the manager, Steve, who followed up our dining experience with a ""thank you for being a patron"" call!

I will DEFINITELY be stopping at this restaurant each & every time I am in town and recommend everyone do the same:-)"	3

We also split the Chilean Sea Bass on searing plates. $49. Never needed a knife. For a side we had the creamy spinach. 
It was my wife's birthday and we were comped a wonderful chocolate raspberry cake. 
Can't say enough about out service. We had a leisurely 3 hour dinner and were never rushed.

Went back to Ocean Club for my wife's birthday again last night. Service and food outstanding. Told the waiter we didn't want to rush and had a 2 hour dinner which was fabulous. 
Most restaurants loose quality over the years... not Ocean Club! A very special evening."	0

246	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	1	0	4	"Mastro's Ocean Club is all about energy and quality.   I am a fan for several reasons.  

First and foremost, the steak's are amazing and the seafood tower is so wrong (RIGHT!!) on every level.  

Additionally, it is great to go somewhere that has a great energy to it and just makes you feel good, excited and full of life.  And the people watching is some of the best in Scottsdale. I will say nothing more as you have to experience it.  The bar team does a great job and the cocktail waitresses work hard and always have a smile on their face. The servers I have had have been professional and available without hovering.  Some have the skill for bonding with the table and some don't but all are excellent at what they do.  The music is fun and full of life.  

And finally, the management team is amazing. I was sad to see Frank leave but am thrilled that Nick has been promoted and know he will continue the VIP feeling they have always been known for.   Definitely check them out. So worth it."	1

Overall a great vibe and is on my usual rotation of places to have great business dinners. Not cheap, in fact downright expensive. My biggest complaint is the wine mark up. They have a great wine selection but seem to press new limits of how much you should mark up wine. 
Save your money then go to Mastros to blow it all on good food and a good time."	1
248	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	5	Awesome place. My husband and I went to Mastro's Ocean Club while visiting Scottsdale on a business trip based on the reviews on Yelp. It was wonderful!!!  The bar scene was amazing, the live music which was heard from outside was the greatest music. The appetizers and drinks came to our table sizzling, wow!!  I was impressed.  The shrimp cocktail and martini were fabulous.  Our waiter, I believe his name was Brandon, was the greatest.  Very sweet, thoughtful, made suggestions, not pushy.. great guy.  The steak wasnt fabulous, probably my fault though, i ordered it medium well, so a little overcooked, but the crab legs were to die for.  The bread and butter brought out before dinner were warm and fresh.  We are from Los Angeles, but have never been to the Mastro's in Beverly Hills.  Actually, I had never even heard of it til I read the reviews on Yelp.  The staff, hostess, waiters, etc. were all outstanding, even the lady in the bathroom handing out towels was a pleasure, thank you for having her there.  I will definitely come back to Mastros Ocean Club, actually i want to move to Scottsdale once the kids go to college.	0

Mastros/ Scottsdale exceeded our expectations!!  The Blackened Chilean Sea Bass was the absolute best I've ever had!   Great bar experience, live music while waiting for our reservation.

We had what was described to us as a Mediterranean Sea Bass for our entree. It was ok, not a ton of flavor, but it was saved by the wonderful side dishes we had. 
For dessert we had the chocolate cake and the butter cake. The winner of the two was the butter cake! Amazing!!! 
Lastly we topped off the night with some 20yr Pappy Van Winkle. What a great night! Love this place."	1

My husband and I were enthusiastically greeted by several beautiful hostesses as we walked in.  We opted to sit at the bar where we were once again made welcome by Alexis and George, our bartenders for the evening.  We each ordered a martini which was made to perfection.  Shaken vigorously and served in a chilled glass with the extra contents left on the bar in an ice cold mixing steel for us to pour when we we ready.   Behind us was a small band that played great classics and tunes that many of the guests were dancing to on the ""17 square foot"" dance floor.  LOL!   Josh and Brie were a lot of fun and very good entertainers.  

We ordered escargot, calamari w/ a unique dipping sauce and roasted bone marrow appetizers.  These were served to us by a very pleasant and professional bar back, Cesar. These dishes proved to be expertly prepared, served piping hot and very tasty.   My husband struck up a conversation with a lovely young lady next to him, Ann. To his delight she was a fellow east coaster and he was thrilled to hear a familiar accent.  Ann was very nice as was typical of every person we met here and as it turned out she was related to the General Manager, Phil.  Phil stopped by and took the time to introduce himself and speak to us like we were old friends.  

I cannot give enough accolades to describe our time at the Ocean Club.  If you are in the Scottsdale area and want to have a fun and unique dining experience. This is the place!"	1

260	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	32	20	5	"I wanted to make this a special dinner because it was our 25th anniversary so we decided to go to Ocean Club. I made my reservations on Open Table and got a call from Mastro's to confirm my reservation. I knew this was going to cost me but what the heck it's a once in a lifetime marker in our lives. 

We walked in and were greet by three people. Seated promptly. Seemed pretty fancy. It was a little dark with the only light from the tinted windows. Server greeting us promptly and providing our drink orders. 

We started off with their bread basket and boy was the bread good. Really liked the pretzel roll the best but it was all really good. We were careful not to fill up on bread. Just so tempting. 

We ordered the calamari to start off. All rings and no legs. The sauce was really good. Not to spicy but really flavorful. The calamari was cooked perfect with a light breading. Really good and everyone enjoyed it a lot. 

I had the Chilean Sea Bass based on then Yelp reviews. Our server Shawn recommended Mastro's way to prepare it and all I know is  it was so good. It had a light crust on the fish and it was such a thick piece of fish. Cooked perfectly. Juicy, tender, and flaky. Really good. Recommend the sea bass any time. We ordered the side of sugar snap peas and boy were those good. Probably the best I've had. Cooked perfectly. Tender, fresh and just melt in your mouth good. I really couldn't get enough of those. Everyone loved it. Then my son wanted some shoestring potatoes cause he had them at Dominic's and he wanted to try these. These were really crispy and really good. The portion was so big we couldn't finish them. 

My wife got the swordfish steak which came with two fairly big pieces. Really tender but not as tender as the sea bass. Juicy and fresh. She liked it a lot and i tried it and it was pretty good. 

My son (yes, he joined us too) ordered the 12oz Filet and it was pretty big and thick. When he was cutting it, you could tell it was tender. It was like cutting butter. He liked it a lot. I didn't get to try it cause I was so full. Couldn't eat another bite. Looked nice and juicy. Cooked perfectly. No issues here. 

I know I said I was fully and so was everyone else but we just had to try their dessert. We always share so we ordered the warm butter cake and told them it's our anniversary. It came on a nice big plate wishing us a happy anniversary. Really nicely decorated. Melt in your mouth goodness. Really good butter cake with slivers of fresh fruit and homemade whip cream. Boy was that good. Little crispy on the edges. Moist and warm with ice cream on top. So good. The best part is that it was on the house cause of our anniversary. 

Service was excellent. Filling our water glasses and ice tea all the time. Making sure everything was okay and even having the manger come by to check on us. Really good service. They took our plates off in a timely manner and clear the crumbs off our table. Very very good service. They even have someone in the bathrooms to help you out and serve you there too. 

So this isn't a place I can visit on a regular basis cause it really expensive but nice for special occasions. Great service, really good food. Fresh. The ambiance was so calm yet elegant (if that makes sense). Noise level was okay, just depending on the tables around you. So we had a really nice Anniversary dinner and enjoyed it a lot. I will probably be back for another special occasion. Enjoy"	37
261	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	"So after searching many of the fine dining restaurants online  in Phoenix I decided on MOC 12/8/17.
I was celebrating my girlfriends birthday so I wanted her to enjoy her dinner most of all. The food was excellent! We started out with 1/2 dz oysters and the calamari which was great. Then we both had the petite filets, lobster mash potatoes and roasted Brussel sprouts. The food was awesome! Here is my complaint.. I knew the cost going in and was ok with it, I mean it's fine dining. My issue was our waiter. From the very moment he presented us with the menus he tried to push the most expensive items. From the wine, to the appetizers, entrees and even the after dinner drinks. I spent $300 for the two of us and had no qualms about it! I can read and I knew the cost so I just can't fathom other than tip why he would insist the way he did. It was annoying and we finished one bottle of wine and after he suggested another, we declined it was like he went MIA on us. We tip well when treated well at min 20% but he was not deserving of more than the 17% I begrudgingly gave only because I was thinking of the bus boys and the tip out. MOC talk your staff, no need to push those items, most patrons going to places such as yours I think will tip accordingly and considering your prices I'd say your waiters probable do ok for themselves w/o the push!"	0

I have been her a million times, or so it feels like, and each time it the menu and staff improve. The oysters were amazing. It is definitely worth asking what the catch of the day is. We had Fanny Bays, which are a bigger more meaty oyster, the blue points and the kumomotos were spectacular. 

We ordered the scallops- to die for. However everything is great here. From the bone-in-ribeye to the swordfish. We started out this evening with the crab cakes, which were phenomenal. 

Our wine choice was point on, Dan did direct us in the right direction. We shared Justin by the bottle , along with speaking pelligrino. We did have two glasses of an amazing red blend as well at the bar.

Excellent filet mignon prepared to perfection
The scallop potatoes are an absolute must and are creamy yet lightly crisp with spectacular flavor.  Broccoli side dish was huge and flavorful.

Creamed corn- another must try!

Cheesecake and pecan pie were huge and over the top.  A great way to wind down an excellent meal.

Silver Oak Napa Valley Cab is always a winner, but was marked up about 100 bucks way too much but won't hold against them because I bought it anyway.

I've been to 4 Mastros in California, 1 in Las Vegas and now 2 in Scottsdale and it's always been the same great quality and service.    Their cold seafood platter is dynamite and the server is cognizent of how many items to order for the amount of people in the party.  Their Ice Berg Wedge is an excellent starter and I always get the Petite Filet Medium.  The steak is pretty thick and ordering it Medium Rare can be red and cold in the middle.  

Whenver I travel and I know that there will be a Mastro's, the restaurant will be on my list to visit first."	1

Our server was informative and attentive. He provided helpful responses to our menu questions.  I started with the lobster bisque which was flavorful and included lumps of lobster meat.  My entree was the Sea Scallops which were toped with a wine sauce and lightly broiled.  Awesome!!  My friend had the salmon and the macaroni and cheese with bacon.  Our waiter suggested ordering the crumbled bacon with the Mac and Cheese.  It was delicious.  Our food was promptly delivered to our table while it was at the appropriate temperature.

I highly recommend this restaurant to anyone who loves steak.	1
274	_4Gpn_NIM94D9OFucgfaJQ	0	0	4	The concierge at the Fairmont recommended Mastro's Ocean Club for dinner. This is a fairly large restaurant and reservations are highly recommended. At 7:30pm this place was full. It's a hip, loud and cool restaurant with live music. Service was excellent with multiple people working each table. The seafood is fresh and the mussels were some of the best I have ever had. Excellent, fresh oysters and lobster were also enjoyed and shared. The main courses of different fishes and steaks were good. I do not care for restaurants were you need to buy the sides separately and then share them with the whole table. We decided on the fries and the serving was large and okay. Chocolate cake and raspberry sorbet for dessert was excellent. Overall, a very fun night with good service and food.	0

The serving size was very generous, and came with the shaker on the table for a ""refill.""  I had the onion and beefsteak tomato salad, which was quite good, and very simple. The bone in Ribeye was to die for: crusty top, meltingly tender interior, and huge. The roasted Brussels sprouts were my favorite side, but the lobster mashed potatoes were memorable. For dessert we split the chocolate cake, pecan pie, and butter cake. By far, the star of the show was the butter cake-i will be thinking about that dessert for a long time!  Service was friendly, at tentative, and very informative."	0

The service is always good. The steak was good, although not cooked to the correct temperature which is surprising for a steakhouse. I would recommend ordering for a lesser cook than what you normally order. I typically order medium, but at donovan's would get medium rare. The side dish menu was somewhat limited, but we chose the creamed spinach and asparagus, both were good. Of course, you have to try the creme brulee - Yum!"	4

Although we ordered entirely too much food, my only complaint is that I couldn't finish it all!
SERVICE is top notch without being N.PHX/Scottsdale snotty.  Bartender knows how to make a Manhattan and an Old Fashion (huge pluses in my book).
FOOD is excellent.  Caesar Salad: Yum!  Shrimp were huge and cooked to perfection (not sure why this is lost on many other restaurants). Do yourself a favor and save room for their creme brûlée. I was so bummed that I had eaten so much, I could honestly only get thru half of it...trust me, I tried to finish!  I'm *still* stuffed (the morning after).  I want to go back and have something small like a salad just so I can dive into that dessert again!  Husband had the cheesecake and cleared his plate. Espresso: excellent, served traditionally - also a huge plus for us.
I hope all the people who took advantage of the Groupon type deal (last week), allow themselves to come back and enjoy Donovan's when it's not such a mad-house.  Slow down, take a load off and let this place do what they do. 
Great for special occasions.

The atmosphere inside is very versatile; it's relaxed enough for a business dinner or casual meal but can also be romantic seated in one of the cozy booths. The service really was wonderful. They were friendly, attentive, informative without being pushy. What I really liked was that they included sides in the price of the entree and a lot of higher end steakhouses do not. Food was delicious and it was an overall good experience.	1

What I loved about them most of all is once they found out we were US Army Veterans who had served in Afghanistan and Iraq, they gave us a $50 credit.  How wonderful is that?  They thanked us for our service.  Remarkable.  Always will go back, forever."	6

I also iike that Donovan's doesn't seem to be as loud as other steakhouses.  I have to say that one of the great things about this restaurant is that it is consistent, even on holidays.	0

Anyone who uses a Groupon or Living Social on the day it expires knows how horrific that can be: overcrowded restaurants who usually aren't aware of the fact tons of people will be trying to use their things.  Donovan's was prepared I'm happy to say.

We did wait about 15 minutes after our reservation time, but being as how my friend was late it really didn't matter much.  The restaurant was really crowded but our server was attentive and pleasant.

We both ordered filets and they were perfectly cooked and couldve been cut with just a fork.  The garlic mashed potatoes were creamy and delicious.  

The interior is somewhat typical for a steakhouse. Wood interiors and dark atmosphere."	4
306	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	7	5	4	"Came here for a work dinner and really enjoyed it.  Drinks were strong!  And delicious.

We had some appetizers.  Nothing really stood out except the mushrooms.  Everything else was fine but the stuffed mushrooms were very good.

Now the steak...I had the rib eye and it was phenomenal.  I didn't think I could eat it all but I did.  Subsequent to that, one of my dining companions said she couldn't finish her filet.  It looked like she had only taken a couple of bites.  She suggested I try it and I did.   And by try it, I meant that I finished the whole thing.

Service was friendly and professional.   Very good place."	10
307	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	"For years my husband and I have been saying we want to try Donovan's but never got around to it until last month. It was our 11 year wedding anniversary and we had made reservations at another upscale restaurant. After asking for an outdoor table on 4 separate occasions, they tried to seat us indoors.  Then told us it would be a 30-45 minute wait for the patio. We decided not to patronize the nameless restaurant but were now left in a jam. It was our anniversary, a Saturday night at 8:00 and we had comedy tickets for 9:30. We called Donovan's on a whim and were immediately delighted by their customer service. 
Within 15 minutes they prepared a cozy booth for us and had red rose petals on the table. The waiter was aware of our time crunch and went above and beyond to expedite a delicious meal. My husband had the large filet, cooked perfectly, and augratin potatoes. Just a side note: Donovan's is one of the very few local steakhouses that serves ""Prime"" cuts of meat. And that higher quality makes all the difference! I had an iceberg wedge salad and a side of asparagus. Which were perfect for this super picky eater. Finally, they presented us with a sensational creme brûlée with a candle in it. 
Bottom line: Great food, excellent service and attention to detail. They put the other restaurant we were supposed to go to, TO SHAME!"	1
308	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	This restaurant is awesome! My husband and I have been here during restaurant week and during normal weeks as well. Their surf & turf is the best. Steak & lobster. How can that go wrong? Superb service & delicious food. Pricey but worth it.	0

If you've never been here, definitely plan on doing so.  You'll be attended by the most attentive and professional wait staff I've ever encountered.

Everything here is top-notch.  Your food will be cooked exactly to your specification without fail.

I got the veal chop, my brother and father got the NY, and my son got the salmon.  The salmon was tastier than that of Bluewater Grill, and the steaks were far better than Morton's.  The salads and sides were given the same level of attention that the steaks were.

Yes, everything is a la carte, and this place is pricey.  The portion sizes are very generous, and you'll have trouble leaving room for dessert.

I'm looking forward to another visit on my next trip to Phoenix."	1
310	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	Amazing. Every time we come here we thoroughly enjoy ourselves. The wait staff doesn't put on an act and they are genuinely good servers. The ambiance is calm and quiet, but the restaurant could use a little more of a modern look.  The style in in each room is a little outdated. Typically, we have the filet with sides of mash and a veggie.  They serve these sides to share and are not individual dishes.  The steak is always cooked true to temperature.  Donovan's food is comparable to Flemings for those of you who have eaten there.  Plan on spending a bit of money if you go here, especially if you have a drink or two with your meal.  The creme brûlée is also delicious and very satisfying! Look out for the yearly groupons they have as well because if you have never tried Donovan's it is a great time to go.	2

The wait staff and manager are equally attentive to each costumer to ensure a five star experience! Do not skip out on dessert, the Creme Brûlée, Tiramisu and Double Chocolate brownie are equal contenders for first choice. Ask the manager to recommend a good tawny port to pair with the brownie, the combination is like getting a hug from a teddy bear.	1

As our waitress, Sarah F., became familiar with us she offered a special wine that was mid priced but limited in offering. It was incredible. Next the food, very good and very appropriate serving sizes. But I got to tell you that I would have gladly had a serving of oysters and two bottles of that wine. (Random Ridge) Wow!

The steaks,  mine the 20oz NY Bone in which Augustine recommended was freaking amazing and cooked to perfection. My girlfriend had the 8oz fillet also cooked to perfection."	1

My brother was generous to give us gift cards for this place.
When you drive up, they have valet parking. I was hoping this place would be nice but it was beyond my expectations! Our table had rose pedals sprinkled on it. The service was great, we were pampered throughout the dinner. We ordered fried calamari for an appetizer.......crispy and not greasy. Very good. I had the French Pinot Nois wine, absolutely devine. My filet mignon was delicious, very tender and cooked perfectly. The scallops wrapped in bacon were yummy. Potatoes augraten were the best I have ever had, not mushy, the cheese that was used was flavorful, the dish was stacked into a neat square. The asparagas  salad with roasted red peppers in a balsamic dressing was refreshing. My husband had the prime rib steak which was very good but too fatty for me. He had a potato that had a gravy over it, the potato was sliced and crispy, I would of liked it without the gravy/sauce. The spinach salad with almonds was ok. Bread is served at the start which was good. 
We were given cream brule' to share, it was in a bowl that was placed on a platter with Happy Anniversary written on it, with chocolate. Amazing!  I was under the assumption that there was a dress code, but I witnessed folks in shorts, flip flops etc. Be prepared to spend more than a car payment. But overall it is worth it!

The place was very clean our waitress had a new waiter shadowing her but they were both very professional and outstanding my wife and I both had the T-bone steak hers was well done mine was medium well and both was cooked to perfection. The rest of the meal was outstanding as well. When we made our reservations we let them know that it was our anniversary and when we arrived we had a table reserved and we had a nice little happy anniversary place card surrounded by roses made into the shape of a heart and we both were very very pleased with that, this will definitely not be our last visit to Donovan's. Just my opinion but other than being a little pricey we enjoyed ourselves, but I have been to places that were a lot more expensive. We were both very pleased that we chose Donovan's to have our anniversary dinner and we will return again Donovan's to you and your staff thanks very much enjoyed everything.	1

327	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	6	4	5	"Have you ever experienced a visit to a restaurant that you wouldn't change in any way?  

Everything about Donovan's was outstanding - from the time we arrived to the time we left, it was nonstop wonderful food, ambiance and service.  

We enjoyed:

Crab cake appetizer:  It was more like a crab continent - this thing was big!   Big and full of crab meat goodness, without any filler.  Crab, crab  and more crab.  

Spinach salad:  Light blend of spinach, mushrooms, bacon and a tangy dressing - a great transition into the main course

Filet with shrimp scampi:  My filet was prepared a perfect medium rare, and the shrimp were graced with a light garlic sauce that still allowed the shrimp flavor to shine through.  Entrees come with vegetables (snap peas and carrots - crunchy and flavorful) as well as a choice of potato.  We both chose baked potatoes, which were garnished with all the fixin's tableside.  Yum!

Wine and water glasses never went empty - every need seemed to be anticipated before we could even ask.  The team made us feel both appreciated and pampered.  I wish more restaurants had this type of attention to detail.

My only regret is we did not save valuable stomach real estate for dessert.  Guess a return visit has to happen soon!"	9

Every trip to here is perfect to the last detail."	2
329	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	"Thanks to Groupon, we decided to give Donovan's a try. Yes, you do have to valet your car. (Free valet, but we all know free does not exclude a tip.) I personally like dimly lit restaurants, so the interior was appealing. I prefer booths, but we had made our reservation that same day, so we ended up being seated at a table in the middle of the room. (We were told that all of the booths were reserved.) You probably have to ask for a booth specifically in your reservation when you call ahead.

The service is terrific: a team of several people makes sure you have everything you need at all times. My husband and I both thought our steaks were delicious. He went nuts over the skillet fried potatoes side, and I loved my au gratin potatoes. My husband also ordered the spinach salad, which we both agreed was fresh and tasty. The crème brulée we split was one of the better ones we'd had in awhile. Our only (small) disappointment was that the complimentary bread was very tasteless and bland. 

While Donovan's is an expensive night out, I appreciated the fact that the entrees come with a veggie and potato side. So many high-end steakhouses charge extra for that. They also offer a three course prix fixe menu that looks intriguing. I would love to come back, especially for a special occasion."	3

333	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	I'd never been here before and since it was my nieces last night in town, we decided on Donovans tonight for our yearly splurge night. Sooooo glad we did! 1st and foremost, the 5 stars are mostly because of our service! We had Sarah and Nick (back waiter) and they were so fantastic. Sarah was helpful with the menu, personable and had a great sense of humor. We just adored her. Now for the food....we had calamari and mac n cheese as starters. The calamari was incredibly tender and the mac was delicious. For dinner, the neice had a filet and bacon wrapped scallops, I had a NY but with a peppercorn crust and the skillet potatoes and peppercorn sauce. Even the snap peas for the vegetable were awesome! My brother had a filet as well and he tried a ceaser salad, too. So good! For dessert, we had creme brulee and my niece had a choclate mousse cake. All were very good. If I had any sort of complaint, it would be the amount of times we were asked if everything was ok. 2 managers, of course Sarah, Nick, the hostess (who was a super sweet little red head girl) and the valet (who called us by name so that was cool) It wasn't super annoying or anything but our conversation was interrupted a few times. It was just a little excessive. But...thank you Donovans crew for ....well...everything. spot on!!	0

338	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	4	1	5	"Yep.  It was that great!

Service was flawless - immediate refilling of glasses before they were below half full, waitress heard me comment about temperature and immediately offered a sweater (which was needed), drinks were quickly brought to the table (and my mixed drink was described with a few extra details to ensure it's what I was wanting).

Food was perfectly, and I mean, PERFECTLY cooked.  Grabbed some of the peppercorn sauce for my smashed garlic potatoes.  While the taters definitely stood on their own, I'm glad to have had the crazy delish gravy to douse my potatoes with.  The veggies of a single carrot and snow peas were cooked fine, but being a veg-head, I'd have wished for a lot more.  Regardless, my filet, potatoes, and veggies were more than enough for an over-the-top gluttonous meal!

The manager stopped by the table to make sure everything was to our liking and cooked correctly.  Even valet was seamless with the experience.

Based on some of the reviews, I was concerned we'd find our steaks under-seasoned, and I even thought about asking for extra seasoning.  Alas, it was absolutely perfect as is.

Definitely a splurge-worthy meal!

Bonus: the happy hour offers discounted cocktails and free steak sandwiches...we didn't imbibe since a steak sandwich before my steak meal seemed a bit over-the-top-fatass-American."	9

Both meals were excellent. The steaks are USDA Prime, the best you can get, wet aged in house. The wait staff was delightful (especially Jay) and the atmosphere was what you would expect from a top tier steak house: dim lit, dark wood and understated elegance. I really appreciated that the steak dishes come with two sides, unlike the ala carte menus of other high end steak places. I also appreciated the complimentary valet parking and bottled water they bring to the table. We had an $80 Livingsocial coupon (that I bought for $40) that helped take the edge off of the bill. We will be going back to Donovans!	0
346	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	2	0	5	"This excellent restaurant was a compromise between the wife and I.  I wanted a traditional wedding, and she would rather just get married in front of a judge.  Considering this was where we went on our first date, I am glad that we were married here.  It has an air of symmetry.  

Either way, John Simich, the Sales & Marketing Manager at Donovan's, treated us right.  For the price of food, we used two of their adjoining meeting rooms.  He threw together a special menu with our pre-selected choices on drinks and food.

The ceremony was conducted in the left meeting room.  It was set up with chairs on either side, and there was a nice aisle down the middle for Aggie to walk down.  I was waiting for my (soon-to-be) wife down at the end.  It was as traditional as I wanted it, and it felt great, but it was not lock-stepped with older conventions.  

The parents walked down the aisle, our daughter put down the petals, and everyone took their place (except the bride).  Instead of Aggie being walked down the aisle in the traditional fashion,she spoke up to get people's attention by saying ""Can I say something crazy?"" followed by my ""I love crazy!   We then performed  ""Love is an Open Door"" from Disney's Frozen, but it is kind of hard to have an excellent performance when the person that can sing breaks down.  But, it was great.  

After the ceremony, we went to the adjoining conference room for dinner.  The cake was on our left.  Aggie and I had our own table at the head of the conference room, and we both had nice giant chairs at our own personal table.  Every one of the tables had a Donovan's Signature Seafood Tower as the center piece, and we had our own personal half-tower as well.  

Our choice of salad:
Caesar Salad
Diced Chop House Salad with Italian Vinaigrette 
---both were great, and there were no complaints.

The other appetizer besides the Seafood tower was Cajun Seared Lamb Chops.  Everyone loved it.

The entree choices (served with garlic smashed potatoes and the vegetable of the day):

8 oz. Prime Filet Mignon

16 oz. Prime Ribeye

Cherry Glazed Pork Chops

North Atlantic Salmon with Maître d' Butter.

Herb Crusted Shelton Chick with Tomato & Caper Sauce

Dessert:

Our wedding cake from Honeymoon Sweets, and Donovan's served it with fresh berries and vanilla ice cream.  

It was a great experience, and I am glad that we held it at such a nice area.  Considering the guest took their leftovers, it instantly makes it better than any other wedding I have attended.  Never mind the food being flat out better than anything you can get from caterers.  

If you want to get married and you want the first class experience, but you do not want to pay first class prices, I would recommend giving Donovan's a call..."	1

My mom was visiting from out of town and based upon the not so nice review I left on Mother's Day about the Donovan's in La Jolla that manger reached out and offered to make things right at the location in Arizona. We were treated like royalty, this place definitely set the bar as to how customers should be treated when dining out! The manager at the La Jolla location and the manager at the Phoenix location were in communication on how to make this experience for my mom and I a great one and it was evident in the service. From the valet (which was complimentary) to the wait staff, to the busser, everything was top notch. AND I finally got the chop salad I had been thinking about for the past several years. I will definitely be back during happy hour. Thank You Adrian and John for taking the time to make this a great personal experience for my mom and I.	0

The service was above average. The staff absolutely went out of their way to ensure we had the best possible experience (Sarah, Nick, and Raul were top notch). Bar was a little noisy but it was happy hour so understandable (also it was our choice to sit there). 

I had the 10 oz filet with au gratin potatoes, vegetables and we added a side of mac and cheese with bacon (just to check it out). The filet was like butter. There was no fat on it and it was cooked perfectly. Potatoes were great - and it was a large portion, too. Vegetables were so good and crisp that I actually ate the snap peas (and peas are disgusting). Finished with the creme brûlée and a large sigh. 

So amazing. Will definitely return!!"	5

I had the 10oz Prime Filet because I wanted some leftover for steak and eggs in the morning (which I almost didn't have because I ate so much!). It was cooked perfectly and as tender as it can be. I always add butter to my steak and personally I think most need it but that's just a personal preference. Wouldn't have minded just a tad more seasoning though. The server recommended the au gratin potatoes - and with good reason. They were fabulous.  Again, cooked perfectly with great flavor without the need for enhancement. For me the big disappointment was the wine list by the glass. Yes, they are known for their extensive wine offerings and it really was some great selections. However, there was just the two of us and my husband doesn't drink wine so I just wanted a glass and was disappointed with my options and what I ultimately ended up with. I gave the server credit though as he gave a recommendation for what I was looking for (which was red, dry, full bodied) and the best option wasn't that good and I didn't feel it paired well with my red meat - too fruity. Again, that's just my opinion. Outstanding service. All in all, however, I would try Donovan's again; just wouldn't have wine with my meal.	0

Perfectly cooked and flavorful petite filet with lobster tail also cooked to perfection. Immediately aware that your teeth have met a piece of Prime. Many lobster can be over-cooked any chewy, not this one. I had them de-shell it for me as it should be in a nice place and ate it and the steak with au gratin potatoes over the course of an hour.

The only downer was the groupon/living social grazers coming in without any etiquette and not even knowing to turn their phone to silent/vibrate. I had to look at them and say aloud ""Honestly?"" and they seemed to get the hint. Enjoyed the rest of my $106 meal!

When we arrived at the restaurant, we grabbed a drink at the bar (it was happy hour pricing) and then we were shown to our table which was adorned with red rose petals.  

Everyone who visited our table that evening congratulated us on our anniversary.  

We enjoyed their bacon mac n cheese, their house chop salad, and their rib eye steak.   

We were all set to order dessert when our service staff delivered a complimentary Creme Brulee that was simply divine.  

All in all the food and the service was excellent. Definitely worth the trip. 

Today I received an email thanking us for our visit and again wishing us happy anniversary.  It does not get much better than the total experience that is Donovan's Steak and Chop House."	1

The bread that it is served on is really nice a crispy on the outside. The meat is juicy and tender. Also a tortilla and beef roll up is served.  Perfect with a glass of red wine.
I love to go to HH as it gives me an introduction to their food. If it is good then this is the place I want to got for a special occasion dinner."	0

My fiancé and I took my mom for her 65th dinner and Donovan's did not disappoint. I always order fish, even at steak restaurants! Special Chilean sea bass and was exquisite. They both got NY strips and were in heaven. Wine pairing is thoughtful. Loved this place. Very relaxing too. We dined and were not rushed at all and enjoyed each other's company for at least 2 hours. And, of course, they brought my mom whatever birthday dessert she desired. New York cheesecake. All in all, I give this place YUMMM stars!!	0

Service (Tina, Brett and Angel at the table or Jason at the bar), the food, (perfectly executed steak, the Rib Chop was divine); the succulent apple tart, great espresso... The manager stopped at the table, the ambiance is top notch. A flawless experience. I know now why Donovans is the best Steakhouse in Arizona.	1

We then got a filet and bone in ribeye, both Oscar style, and was pleasantly surprised to hear they used king crab for their Oscar. The bearnaise sauce was a bit too lemony for me. I will be coming back for sure.	0

365	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	Okay I have to say that I loved this meal. It was one of the better meals that I have had in a long time. We started off with the bacon wrapped scallops. They were on a bed of asparagus with a ginger orange sauce. Very delicious! I had the Fillet Oscar which were two fillet mignon medallions with crabmeat and a hollandaise sauce on top. They were cooked perfectly. It was accompanied by asparagus and potatoes au gratin. I also ordered a side of the brussels sprouts with bacon. They were very good. Don had the 12 ounce New York with the garlic mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas. It was cooked perfectly and he ate every last bite. I couldn't pass up dessert of bread pudding and a coffee with Frangelica and Bailey's. It was the perfect ending to a wonderful meal. We will definitely be back!	1

368	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	1	5	Went here for restaurant week because we're cheap and don't like to pay full price and very glad we did.  I must be getting old because there was soft music in the background and even though the restaurant was busy it was relatively quiet and I liked it that way.  My wife and I were probably the youngest patrons in the restaurant by at least 20 years.  The food was awesome.  I ordered the filet rare and it actually came out rare.  It's the easiest way to cook steak but you'd be surprised how many other places mess that up.  I like this place better than City Hall but less than Shula's.  I'd come here again if I were trying to impress some out-of-towners visiting me... if my out-of-towners were over 50 years old.	2
369	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	The best steak I have ever eaten. Service is also very good. This restaurant is very expensive, so don't let that surprise you. All parking is valet. The restaurant is upscale so dress accordingly.	0
370	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	1	0	5	"A couple years ago I received a gift card to Donovan's Steak & Chop House. I had never been before and set it aside to save for a special occasion. Well, special occasions came and went and I kind of forgot about the card. Then my wife and I were looking for some place to go for our 20th wedding anniversary last night and we remembered the card and decided to check it out.

It was fantastic! Great atmosphere, great staff, great food. The perfect place for our special dinner. When I made the reservation I mentioned that it was our anniversary and upon arrival they had made a heart out of rose petals on our table and gave us an amazing crème brûlée on the house for dessert. My filet was perfect. I love ""meat"" but get grossed out by a bloody steak and this was the very perfect amount of pink, somehow stayed the perfect temperature thought the meal, and was seasoned or something so that it was as delicious on the outside as it was on the inside if that makes any sense. 

We had a gift card but still felt the prices were fair for the quality of food, setting, and service.

The room felt old/traditional but not at all stuffy or too fancy. Most guests were dressed pretty casually but we still felt comfortable and not at all out of place dressed up in a suit and in a dress with heels. 

I'm so glad we were introduced to a wonderful place where I'm sure we'll enjoy future special occasions!"	2
371	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	1	0	5	"One of the best meals in the Valley of the Sun, maybe the best. We haven't been often but our experiences have been great. (If you don't like red meat or you accept the advice of a professional not to consume red meat you might as well stop reading). It has great steaks. I have had ribeye and Kansas City bone-in cuts. Both were great steaks, cooked perfectly. Wife and one friend had veal chop and both were happy with it.  Meals come with potatoes and there are good choices. We didn't bother with appetizers but all of us had salads. My tomato and onion salad with blue cheese dressing was pretty good. The onion was hot so I didn't finish it.  My wife said the beet salad was ok but she wouldn't get it again. One friend had the chopped salad and said it was great. Fresh carrot and snow pea sides were good but not important to me. I skipped dessert but wife and had a brownie and a friend had an Oreo ice cream sundae and both liked them. The wine list is expensive but I found a very nice Australian Shiraz for $60 which is cheap on the wine list. Everyone loved it.  The martinis are great.  Which brings me to price: it is expensive. I don't flinch when prices are high but this is definitely a ""special occasion"" place.  I like it a lot. Be prepared for ""sticker shock"". It is worth it."	1
372	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	1	2	5	"Everything about our evening was wonderful.

Let me start by saying that I've been to a number of steakhouses in my lifetime. I've been to the chains (Morton's, Ruth's Chris, El Gaucho) and I've been to the local spots. What separates this place from the others is the service. Many of the chain restaurants (or any establishment that calls themselves ""fine dining"" typically train the servers to drool all over you. In other words, they fawn and fuss and hover and dote. Not at Donovan's. The servers were attentive, there when you needed them, and appropriately helpful. They stayed in the background most of the time but were quite probably reading body language from across the room, so that the moment you were perceived to need something, they appeared.

I had a glass of cabernet from Paso Robles that paired beautifully with my 10 oz. filet mignon. The steak was cooked perfectly to my liking. My server made sure I had the same expectation of ""medium"" as the restaurant did. It came out just right. my only complaint about my entree was that the potatoes au gratin was too tiny. I wanted more! Heck, I coulda eaten a whole tray of it! It was the best I've ever had. Creamy, soft potatoes inside, and a nice crispy, salty/cheesy layer on top.

My dining companion ordered the crab cake appetizer for her entree. It was good. There were huge chunks of crab and it was pan fried, not deep fried. Thank goodness.

The Brussels Sprouts side dish was good -- the perfect amount of crunch to softness ratio. I could even taste the natural flavor of the vegetable -- it was oiled and seasoned with bacon bits, but the Brussels Sprouts still maintained their flavor. They were fresh.

The coffee was STRONG. I'd give 5 stars for that! :)

And finally, for desert we ordered their house-made oreo ice cream cake. It was good but way too much oreo. Next time I'd go for the chocolate mousse or creme brulee.

Overall, this was a really lovely meal. Great service, top notch steak, and a relaxing vibe. They do have valet. Next time I'm in Phoenix, I'm making a reservation."	5

374	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	4	My husband took me here for my birthday last week and this was both of our first time dinning at Donovan's. They have complimentary valet right when you drive in, not sure if it's just on the weekends; we went on a Friday. He made a reservation through Yelp earlier and we were seated right away. Our waiter greeted us as soon as we sat down and took our drink order. He said there were 3 people that would assist him throughout the night for various things. Then the bread came shortly after and he took our order after telling us about the specials. The hubby ordered a ribeye (medium rare) and I got the filet minion (medium well) and a side order of Mac & Cheese. The hubby loved the ribeye and the scalloped potato he ordered which also came with mixed veggies. I also loved the filet minion with garlic mashed potatoes and mixed veggies. The Mac & Cheese came shortly after they brought our meal and I forgot all about it while I was devouring my main meal until the hubby pointed it out. Everything was delicious however the price was way too high for the quality. We have been to other steak houses and the steaks were better tasting and a lot cheaper. It was delicious and I guess for a birthday it's okay to spend a little more but I'm fine with just dining at white chocolate grill and paying less than $30.00 for the parmesan crusted filet (my all time favorite). Service was great,  and the dining room was beautifully decorated. Would probably only come back for another special event however not a place to dine at if your not willing to spend over 40+ a steak.	1
375	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	4	"I was very excited to try this steakhouse. I am new to the area and I read great reviews on Yelp. Upon arrival it was nice to have a complimentary valet.  We had reservations for Friday night 7:15. So we figured it would be very busy but it was kind of empty which was surprising. The atmosphere was old school steakhouse but sometimes that is a good thing and yes it was a good thing. 

We were greeted by the hostess who was very pleasant. I will say the service was outstanding and we haven't even sat down yet. I am a stickler about service and It was definitely a great start to our evening. While ordering drinks I inquired about a certain wine and I was offered a sample of that wine to see if I liked it. That was very nice and it made ordering a new type of wine more enjoyable. 

Reviewing the menu I was a little surprised at the prices. My expectations now we're set extremely high. For dinner I ordered Filet and Scallops and my friend ordered Filet and Shrimp. Our food arrived and we both were very surprised. Our Filets were barely bigger than my scallops. The steak was very good and cooked perfectly, the seafood was ok. The service was impeccable.. We had a very pleasant evening but we laughed at the portions. Our side vegetables were green beans, squash and carrots but she should've said carrot  because I only had one carrot and those were cooked perfectly just enough crisp. All in all the food was good but the price for portions were not proportional.   

It was a nice experience but not one that I will repeat in the future, it is a little far and super expensive. The best thing about this place is the phenomenal service but that is why a 6 oz steak is $50 and the price is why I didn't give it at 5 star."	1
376	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	"I have to agree with my wife's assessment that the food and service at this place are top notch. It is the quintessential old-school steakhouse, with all of the details like dim lights, white table cloths, and a team of people ready to help you select your meal. 

I really like the team approach that some restaurants have adopted -- it means that you're not stuck waiting to get some more water, or your food isn't sitting in the kitchen while that group of 10 next to you tries to decide what appetizers to order.  Our team included Sarah and Todd, and they took great care of us.

I have been to many steakhouses, and have paid way too much for slabs of meat, only to walk away with that, ""well, it was good, but, WOW, that cost a lot for what it was,"" feeling. Make no mistake, you WILL pay a lot here. Even without drinks. But, my experience was that the food was absolutely worth the money. I had a ""small"" peppercorn filet, which came with a light pepper crust and a fantastic peppercorn sauce on the side. Neither the sauce nor the crust took away from the flavor of the meat. The sauce on the side is a good idea because you don't want to be hiding the flavor of that prime cut of beef! The steak had a beautiful crusty brown exterior and a nice warm pink center. Mine was cooked perfectly.

The meat came with a side of vegetables and a potato selection. I had the potato side with the same peppercorn sauce that came with my meat. It was a good choice. I don't think the steak cost any more than the other fancy steak places in the area, and may be a little less since it includes the sides. 

The spinach salad we split as an appetizer was good and the crème brûlée we split for dessert was excellent. The only thing I wasn't too thrilled about was the bread. It was fine, but nothing spectacular. I wasn't there for the bread, though, so it wasn't that much of a problem. 

For us, this is a new special occasion place for sure."	0

The salads are full portion, the sides are also generous in size and expertly prepared (we had Lyonnais potatoes and Asparagus).

Larry had the filet and I had the rib eye.  Both were fabulous, but next time I'm going with the filet.  Steaks are not a la carte and actually come with a potato and veg! Don't pass up the au gratin potatoes with gruyere cheese.  To die for.  The wait staff was very attentive, bordering on too much.  Maybe I'm not used to that much attention.  They treated us to a creme brulee in honor of the birthday which was very nice.  The creme brulee was perfection.  The crackle was spot on and the strawberries were the perfect amount of acidity paired with the cream.  This place is pricey but worth it.  Will definitely be returning.	0
386	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	1	3	5	"My wife and I went to Donovan's (Phoenix) on 08/13/2013 for our 13th Anniversary.

Upon arrival, we were greeted nicely and soon seated at our reserved table.  It should be noted that the table was decorated with fresh, red colored rose petals; a nice added touch to accentuate our special evening.  

Interestingly, we were seated directly behind the waiter's POS station, therefore making us privy to how their nights were progressing.  This was actually a nice thing. Being as my wife and I were in the business for years, and having owned & operated our own restaurant, it made us feel as if we were ""in-on"" the behind the scenes action. 

Our team of wait staff was very professional.  They all worked well together and were attentive, yet unobtrusive.  Our water glasses were never less than half full.  We appreciated how knowledgeable the waitress was about the menu, the history of the restaurant, and also the wine list.  

I was going to order a beer (and this is my only complaint about the beverage selection) but was disappointed to find out how Donovan's does not offer beer on tap.  Just a minor suggestion, but there are a few local craft breweries that would make a great fit on the Donovan's (draft) beer menu.  There is nothing like a, poured fresh from the keg, pilsner glass full of ice cold brew!

We ordered appetizers: I had the oysters Rockefeller and my wife had the seared scallops.  Both were cooked perfectly, and we accompanied the starters with a bottle of Prosecco.  The sparkling wine was very nice, with hints of green apple and peaches.

For the entrees:  My wife ordered the rack of lamb with a baked potato & steamed veggies. I in turn, had the petit filet covered with blue cheese, accompanied by shrimp and a side of vegetables. Both dishes were spectacular.  I paired my meal with a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon, while my wife continued to enjoy the Prosecco.

Additionally, the restaurant did a great job of catering to my wife's gluten and whey allergies.

Unfortunately, while enjoying our meals, the table behind me was occupied by an elderly woman and her much younger male acquaintance.  The complaining coming from the two of them was ceaseless and it made me want to change our table location.  We actually heard her instructing the young man on how to get food comp'd! Their complaints were unwarranted, and the waiter should have said to them, ""Is anything alright?""  

Desserts:  We were presented with an amazingly light and flavorful crème brûlée in celebration of our anniversary.  My wife had decaf coffee and I had a double espresso.

Overall, I would definitely recommend Donovan's to anyone looking for a romantic, fine dining experience, fit for foodies - particularly for those special occasions.

Since you are at a top notch steak house, you will be dropping some serious dough here. All the steaks are prime and delicious. I was very surprised that a steak house did not have any steak tartar or carpaccio. I was very much in the mood for it that night and felt a little let down. The butternut squash soup was very tasty and full of delicious heavy cream. They also had some amazing oysters, my wife commenting, better than the ones we had in Seattle and Portland. I had the Kansas City Bone in New York strip and ate the entire thing. I was actually pretty amazed how much I piled in that night. I would love to be able to come here at least once a week but I don't think my wallet will be able to afford it. Parking is complimentary valet, you just need to tip at the end.	0

Don't come here in a rush.  My steak took about 30 minutes or more to prepare, and it was still a bit rare, so 5 minutes more for it to come out perfect.

This is definitely good for a special occasion.   I saw some tables with roses spread all over.  I would recommend getting a big steak and sharing it with two people.

One thing I can't wait to return for are the Complimentary Prime Filet Mini Steak Sandwiches during Happy Hour.  What a great deal!"	0

Was one of the best steaks I have ever had. The staff always made sure we were taken care of. Best dinner I have ever had! Would highly recommend!	0

Service is superior. Environment is a bit fancy for my taste, but often good food comes with the whole ""well to do"" interior design."	1

I was very impressed with the food and the service.  I ordered a ribeye steak and that was the best steak I have had in a very long time.

While the prices are a little steep, you do get what you pay for and I will be back!! I love Donovan's."	0
401	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	3	1	5	"Phoenix Steakhouses we've been to: Houstons, Durant's, the Capitol Grill and now Donovan's. Donovan's has the best overall package. 

Durant's has a kind of interesting old school atmosphere and decent service but the food is poor. Capitol Grill has a real high end feel to it, great service and the prices to go with it. But their food is mediocre. Especially for the price. Houston's is a steakhouse but not white table cloth and has a different thing going on. But it's always a good meal. 

Donovan's is solid white table cloth fine dining steak house all around. Excellent service. Truly excellent. Great wine list (with half bottles!), and the food.... was worth the price! Amazing. 

We started with the seafood appetizer. OMG. Lobster, shrimp and oysters with three different sauces to choose from. The steaks were perfect. One of our party had the tuna steak and it also was perfect. 

If you're looking for the whole package and wanting the food and experience to be worth the price... Donovans is it."	3
402	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	Finally got to try this place by quite often cuz I'm going to a different Steak House so fine decided try them and I was really impressed number one the service was probably the best I've had quite some time they work in three-man teams and they're quick to get you anything you need drinks or never half empty Baskin refilled those funny I knock my Fork off the table and even before I could ask for no and it was already at my table great service very good at explaining things and what they do and making good suggestions on things that you might want no for the food start off the calamari I didn't particularly like it just something this Bland about it the sauce was pretty good but not crunchy enough or not enough tentacles and then it was just okay now what I do like about the places for the 50 bucks or whatever you spend for the steak it comes with the starch and a vegetable I opted for the ribeye steak and the pain fried potatoes with the peppercorn sauce it was amazing the potatoes if I wasn't so full I would order another one now the stink it was great far as tenderness and seasoning but the wet age their meat instead of dry age which is a little bit different flavor not too sure if I like it or not my son didn't like mine he had the four way which I tried his it was really good but didn't have much sour flavor I would say so I think next time I'll get the filet also have the creme brulee I would skip it didn't like the texture was enough custard it was more like pudding consistency no good for creme brulee I definitely will go back I'll get the filet this time overall will be at 4 but the outstanding service just pushed it over the top that's what you expect for a fine dining restaurant in my opinion cuz you're paying more for the experience in the food at those kind of prices	0
403	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	Excellent service   Very attentive.   The variety of selections were very extensive.   The quality of the beef was as described    A must when in the area.   Great wine selection	2
404	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	My wife and I had an excellent experience on Valentine's Day. Reservations at 9:15 - we were a few minutes late. Valet parking is a big plus. Service was on point and unobtrusive. I ordered the 14 oz filet with demiglace and blue cheese. Perfectly cooked to medium. Best filet in a long time and worth every dollar. Wife ordered huge Australian lobster tail. OMG - it was the biggest I've ever seen and she said it was the best ever. Ambience is opulent without being stuffy. Definitely an upscale meal. Will be back next chance we get.	0
405	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	4	We went because we liked the wine list. The service was excellent. The place was perfect for a working dinner. Our chief complaint though is that the steaks were dry. It was overall good, but I expected a little more on the food front. That being said, it's a good restaurant with a nice ambience.	0
406	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	1	0	4	In all the years I've lived in the valley I've never tried Donovan's.  I'm so glad they offered a special on Livingsocial because if it wasn't for this who knows when I might have tried them, if ever.  Wonderful, from my martini, wedge salad, king crab legs and bone- in ribeye.  Everything was excellent !  I will visit again and very soon.  I'm already craving one of those martinis and a ribeyes!  Service was also very good and friendly.	1
407	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	36	24	5	"I tell you what. I love steakhouses and my family does too. My son got a new suit and my daughter got some really nice dresses for Christmas and this was a great excuse to try Donovan's. Dress up and eat good. 

All the parking here is free valet. As we walked in it was fairly dark with dark wood finish. Very nice ambience. 

Before I could sit down the waiter took the bottle of water at our table and pour a glass for me (as you can tell I was a little late for dinner). We started off with their hot loaf of bread and it was so good. Nice and warm. Soft on the inside and crispy on the outside. Add the butter and boy was that good. 

Anyhow, we started off our meal with the fried calamari. Lightly battered with a tarter sauce. I really enjoyed the calamari. It was so good. Everyone at our table agreed that it was really good. We always order calamari so figuring out the good from the bad is easy for us. Next everyone at our table ordered the seafood chowder but me. My entree that I ordered was so big that I didn't think I could handle it but once everyone ate their chowder they were raving about it. So it got a few bites and man was that good. Lots of seafood at the bottoms of the cup. Got a nice piece of fish. Outstanding. 

I ordered the 16oz ribeye with Au Gratin potatoes and it came with sweet peas, carrot, and squash. Ribeye was so good perfectly cooked. So juicy. So tender. Melt in your mouth goodness. One of the best ribeye's I've had. The Au Gratin potatoes was so good too. Not too much cheese. Potatoes were cooked perfectly. Not under cooked at all. Man was that good. Of course the veggies were so good. I would say this was a great meal. This meal was so good I even ate to flower on top of my potatoes. No taste but now I can say I've eaten a flower. Hahaha

My wife had the Sea Bass with bok choy. She gave me a bite and it was so flaky. So moist. Cooked perfectly. Very nice. 

My mom and daughter got some special for two people where they get an appetizer, entree, and dessert. So they got the seafood chowder, some type of steak with shrimp scampi, and they got a creme brûlée and New York style cheesecake. They loved it all. I got a taste of their creme brûlée and it was so big. Crispy on the top but nice and creamy inside. I thought it was really good. 

Service was outstanding. We had a bottle of water at our table always but if our cups were half way filled then they would make sure our cups were filled. A few of us had iced teas and every time it was empty and new cup of ice was at our table right away. They even kept track of my wife's hot tea and made sure her hot water pot was ok. Cleaned off our dirty dishes and every time someone went to the bathroom they rolled up their napkin on the table. 

Speaking about the bathrooms. Nice and clean. Instead of paper towels. They had rolled up white towels to dry your hands. They also had mouth wash with tiny cups for your breath. Wow. Really nice. 

So we had a really great meal. Great food. Exceptional service. Nice ambience.  This is a really good steakhouse and really expensive. One of the top steakhouses in my books. Outstanding and of course we'll be back"	44
408	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	As usual,  our service was top notch. John, the manager, stops by to say hello and ensures everyone is well taken care of.  Our main waiters,  Brett and Nick were fantastic. When I'm in the mood for steak,  I typically order the ribeye but last night I thoroughly enjoyed a 24oz rib chop. It was the best I've had and would highly recommend. Ended with a tiramisu which was just perfect. Now this is a well run restaurant that knows how to value its patrons. Can hardly wait for our next visit.	0

410	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	1	1	5	Donovan's steakhouse is one of my favorite places to go to now! As you turn into the lot, you are forced to valet park. It's complimentary. When you walk in, there are dark wood tables and such. All the waiters and bus boys are in suits. My advice for anyone that wants to go here is dress up! Wear a suit or something nice! No tee shirts, flip flops, or shorts! It is highly frowned upon to walk into a restaurant like Donovan's with inappropriate clothing. I had the New York strip 12 oz, seafood chowder (this is to die for), and a fruit bowl. The New York was not something to do die for but it does hit all your taste buds. The chowder was SO good. Get that! The fruit bowl is healthy dessert if you want to start eating better. The service was excellent and I wouldn't ask for better. Dominick's steakhouse and Donovan's are equal in pricing and ambience. Donovan's is quieter while Dominick's is loud. I would definitely come back to this place any day!	1
411	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	1	0	5	We had the best service at this place. Boyfriend had the 16 oz ribeye oscar style and me being the vegetarian, had this awesome asparagus salad. Steak was cooked perfectly.  They were very accommodating to what I requested, and they made a veggie like me feel welcome in a steakhouse! If there is one takeaway that you must get out of this review, you must get the Oreo pie for dessert. Thick layers of Oreo crust between vanilla and chocolate ice cream soaking in a sea of chocolate Carmel sauce....OMG to die for! Best dessert I've had in phoenix.	1
412	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	6	21	5	"Phone voice:  ""Are we celebrating any special occasion this evening?""

Me: ""Uh, yeah. We're both still alive and haven't killed one another after all these years.""

Phone voice:  [cute giggle]  Ok, we'll see you both at seven, byeee.""

Service, ambiance and food, the entirety of this event was perfection. But the best part, the coup de gras was our server delivering a dessert neither of us had ordered.

Atop this lovely bowl of creme brulee were beautiful, bright red sliced strawberries and a lone candle, shimmering with light against the darkened enclave where we sat.

Puzzled, and before we could indicate we hadn't ordered dessert....

Server: ""We here at Donovan's are totally glad you two are still alive""


Fun night.
Right up to the point where I had to explain why Donovan's staff brought us a free dessert.
Thanks Donovan's, I think?"	10

414	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	5	5	"We all heed the warnings about drinking and driving especially on New Years Eve. I do need to warn folks of another danger that I experienced this past New Years Eve. This would be eating then driving. I took my lovely wife to Donovan's Steak and Chop House to celebrate our anniversary and NYE. I had the wedge salad, filet Oscar style (awesome), lobster tail (best lobster we ever ate), garlic mashed, veggies and chocolate mouse. When we finished they had to get a hand cart to wheel me out to the car because I was so full I could not walk. I then had to drive us home (I was the DD) which was extremely difficult with the buttons popping off my shirt and ricocheting all around the car. At one point I thought we were being shot at because one button caught me in the back of the head after it bounced off the ceiling. It was wild. So be careful when over consuming kids!
Oh and of course the service was awesome."	1

The staff were very friendly, patient and helpful and we had a wonderful family dinner...it will be our new family tradition!	1

Split the bone in Kansas City strip steak and it was excellent, charred on the outside and med. rare on the inside , just the way we ordered it. It was so flavorful and easily fed 2 people. It came with choice of potato, we love the skillet fried potatoes the best, crunchy on the outside, soft on the inside with yummy peppercorn gravy on the side. It also comes with perfectly cooked fresh assorted vegetables. For dessert we had the brownie and ice cream really enjoyed it. Excellent service always and we will be back next year!	1
418	7jl9EJQCGBiTyXTDXMsRIw	0	0	5	"This restaurant is great! The decor is ""old traditional steak house"" with the dark woods and low light. The food is fantastic and the steaks will melt in your mouth. We ordered the petite and 10 oz filet mignon. You can choose your starch (i.e. smashed potatoes, au gratin, baked potato etc) and your entree also comes with a fresh vegetable medley. Everything was cooked to perfection. Desserts are $11 regardless of which dessert you order. The apple pie was ok. The apple filling was good but because the pie is served in the same dish as a scoop of ice cream, the crust is mushy. The creme brûlée was perfectly done as was the chocolate mousse cake. Service is impeccable. The wait staff works in a team of 3 and are very attentive. A wonderful dining experience."	0

The staff gives the utmost and superb service and really goes above and beyond to make you feel special. 

We started off by ordering the seafood tower, a must have/tradition amongst my family. A large bowl with delicately arranged oysters, lobster, crab legs and topped off with a shrimp cocktail. Served with drawn butter and dipping sauces. Hello, sea-heaven. 

For my main entree, I decided on the 6oz filet mignon, Oscar style, and the bacon wrapped scallops. My filet was cooked to perfection, and the ""Oscar style"" added an even more rich, succulent taste. And as for the scallops, bless thee. 

The cherry on top? Our server, Shane, gave us a complimentary creme brûlée to congratulate my father on his retirement."	4

I've never seen anyone here make fun of other diners, bring a bunch of loud children, drink to excess, look a mess and pretend it's everybody else's problem, or call negative attention to themselves in any way.

Talavera is a slightly different experience for me every time. It's very special."	0

423	R2fjCEHav7HqIhfBRDWQ9Q	0	0	4	This place is more like a 41/2.  Pricey but well worth it.  This is the second time we've been here and just as good as the first time.  We ordered a couple of Ketel One martinis for starters.  With dinner ordered a bottle of their Iconoclast house Cab, pretty good and reasonably priced.  The wild salmon was to die for, couldn't have been happier.  A side of crab and sautéed spinach were nice as well.  The ahi was excellent to boot.  The fennel added a nice level of flavor.  Let me just say this - I LOVE THAT FREAKIN BREAD!  It is so good it's hard to describe.  Comes out in a cast iron pan and glazed with a little butter and salt,  WOW.  I would pay big bucks just for the bread.  The truffles when you leave we're a nice touch.  I had a single espresso also, which was as expected.  Solid service, beautiful view and sunset, and great food.  A drive to get up there but absolutely worth it.	1
424	R2fjCEHav7HqIhfBRDWQ9Q	0	0	4	Hubby took me here for date night recently and had such an enjoyable time, the service was very friendly and attentive, the lamb shank and veal was simply mouth watering, the only thing I didn't care for was the raw beef appetizer, the meat was very fatty which just resulted in an never ending chew.  The cocktails where delicious but man where they strong, we ended up ordering a separate glass of sprite to tone it down but in all honestly, we weren't complaining.	0

While on vacation we stayed at the four seasons.We found this place to be not only over the top in service but more than expected flavor on our meals. We had a spill of red wine at our table which could have been a tragedy(it is as for us) waiter took the meal that was splashed with red wine back and prepared a new one!

We set outside on the patio which has an awesome view of pinnacle peak and the troon area.  

The restaurant has a great wine menu and the drinks are very good.  Start off with a drink at the onyx bar!

432	R2fjCEHav7HqIhfBRDWQ9Q	1	0	4	"Talavera offers outstanding service, very good food, and an absolutely gorgeous setting for a special meal. The price tag is hefty but I left feeling like I had a luxurious meal so I certainly think it's worth it for celebratory occasions. The service was superb. It seemed like our waiter was dedicated to us and our table of 2 (even if that wasn't the case). There was never a long wait, it always felt like he was going above and beyond, and it was all very nice. When making my reservation with Open Table I noted it was someone's birthday and the menus were specially printed with a birthday message - talk about a nice touch! The setting is breathtakingly gorgeous. Of course the Four Seasons grounds are beautiful, and there is wonderful Pinnacle Peak and the sunset to enjoy off the patio. If the weather allows it, I highly recommend a patio table. 

The food was very good too. I guess the only reason this is a 4 star review instead of 5 stars is that the dessert wasn't all that great. I should say the dessert we paid for* because the complimentary truffles we received with a birthday message (again, what outstanding and caring service!) were amazing. I had:

- Beet & Goat Cheese Salad: Such a beautiful dish, a real treat for the eyes. It also tasted very good, so while not unique nor large, it was a yummy start to the meal. I probably wouldn't order it again though - the only app I need is the complimentary buttery skillet bread.
- Butternut Squash Risotto: The vegetarian entree for the day and I initially groaned because risotto is the de facto veg entree. This was the best risotto I've ever had! So creamy yet the rice still had a strong texture to it, instead of being mushy. The mushrooms and other vegetables were a great mix of textures and overall the flavor was very good.
- Chocolate Mousse: I just didn't like this. It was too rich and I've never met a chocolate mousse I didn't like. Some fresh berries or a light cream could have gone a long way in balancing it out.
- Croissant Creme Brulee: Also underwhelming. The fried carrot strips were not to my taste and the croissant pieces just seemed stale."	1

We participated in the Mash Up menu (dodging past the Restaurant Week prix fix menu) because The Breadfruit & Talavera were combining talents & flavors, & we enjoy both restaurants. If you go, try one of the Mash Up deals. Just go to their website to see who'll be the next Valley chef to partner with Chef Mel in the kitchen. And, try to catch a sunset.

437	R2fjCEHav7HqIhfBRDWQ9Q	0	0	4	"Yum! We were here for Restaurant Week, and the mister was definitely glad he forgot to make reservations elsewhere. 

Sat down at their last available table outside and noticed a couple near the edge getting ready to leave. We mentioned it to our hostess and were told that we could move momentarily. Awesome! Our table was quickly snatched up as soon as we moved, so their willingness to accommodate us was appreciated. 

Love their little plate with an assortment of water flavorings. Cucumber, lemon, and lime slices - one of each per guest at the table. 

Started out with the beet salad. So good! The candied pecans had the perfect amount of cinnamon in the glaze. The mister had the lobster bisque. He was a little disappointed that there wasn't more lobster (only one decently-sized piece in the bowl), but liked it well enough. 

They took our drink orders before bringing the first course, and when I ordered two different glasses at different times, the server (maybe the somm? A different server than the one who took our orders) knew which courses I had ordered and clarified the foods. Top notch service right there. 

We added on the beef carpaccio appetizer between the first course and our entrees. It was good, but not quite what I was expecting. Their seven-minute fried egg didn't live up to my expectations. Very little yolk still runny, plus the breading was a little off-putting. I don't like breaded and subsequently fried foods, but the man wasn't sold on it either. Didn't get the hype there. The chive cream was an EXCELLENT compliment, and the mustard was delicious, though a little overpowering. 

My lamb shank entree was strangely sweet and not what I was looking for, but the farro accompaniment was outstanding. I left meat on the bone, but hoovered all the farro. So good. The beef medallions were spectacular! Perfectly done, tender, and juicy. I was almost regretting not ordering the beef for myself. 

For dessert, I had ordered the semifreddo, and was served the icebox cake. Not sure if this was a mixup on their part or not, but it was still tasty and I never mentioned anything to the contrary. The grapefruit was a strange choice next to the chocolate and caramel, as the caramel overpowered it, but the cake itself was so tasty it didn't really matter. The frozen yogurt came out with a plentiful serving of gorgeous, fresh berries. Both of us were happy there. 

The cappuccino after dessert came with cubed sugar, and they allowed us to grab the cup and go walking around the grounds. 

$150 before tip, with Restaurant Week pricing. I probably would've been happier if I would have spoken up about the lamb, but we'll be back. Great food and excellent service."	1

From the wine to the Octopus appetizer to the warm bread... To the Seabass and New York Strip... Everything was perfect! Would highly recommend the Seabass and lobster mac & cheese on the side! The views from the patio were incredible of the city lights and Pinnacle Peak. Even though it was a bit cold, the heaters worked extremely well and the temperature was perfect. After our dinner, we enjoyed live music in the bar outside to cap off a great date night. Would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone!	0

Started with their house bread with Hawaiian sea salt.  First course was tuna tartar with a quail egg.  Balsamic reduction made for w very wonderful start.  Mild tuna with a very flavorful egg.  Second course was a pea tendril salad with fig, plums, prosciutto, Gorgonzola and lemon soubiy.  Charred Spanish octopus with chorizo, shishito peppers, onion and potato, wow!!  Next up was a melt in your mouth tender and mild poached halibut.  Favorite course!  Bison tenderloin with spiced brandied cherries, mole, and fois gras!! A flavor explosion!!  Brûlée plum, fage ice cream, pecans and Carmel sauce. Amazing dessert.  Top 5 all time meals.	0

Had the scallops and they were so good. Also had the lobster mac and cheese and it was delicious. My husband had the bison fillet wrapped in bacon. He enjoyed it. 
Our server Josh was so friendly and his attention to detail was on point. He made us feel like we were the only ones in the restaurant. He took the time to explain everything we were eating and cared if we were going to enjoy it. We had a beautiful evening and the ambience was amazing."	0

We missed the sunset which would have been a  nice addition to our dining experience but nonetheless it was a great time. The seafood platter was perfect, same with really any dish on the menu. The chocolate soufflé was a nice treat as you don't really see that on the menu anymore. Thanks for a lovely dinner!	1

446	R2fjCEHav7HqIhfBRDWQ9Q	0	0	5	Wonderful experience. Did our reservations online and wrote this was my parents 50th wedding anniversary dinner. Our menus across the top stated this, such a thoughtful and sweet gesture. The head chef signed one and it was given back to my Mom with a beautiful bow. This will end up in her scrap book without a doubt. To write about the 3 appetizers, 5 meals and 3 desserts would take too long. I will mention the best. NY strip, scallops and chocolate soufflé. Everything from the duck to the buffalo was fabulous but those 3 were my favorites. All the staff were superb, our waiter was on spot. I love great waitstaff so I really appreciated them all. We sat at 530 so we enjoyed a great sunset. The location is beautiful and the overall feel is comfortable. The whole experience was great start to finish. The only odd thing was the music. DUB, techno and something similar my son called Trap was not really fitting for the atmosphere.	1

We split the shrimp and lobster bisque and the restaurant was nice enough to split the serving in two bowls.  It was good, but not quite as amazing as I was expecting.  For my entree, I enjoyed the sea bass with potato risotto - again, good, but not as good as I was expecting for a Four Seasons and the price you are expected to pay.  The restaurant is beautifully appointed, the views are beautiful and the service was fun and laid back.	1

Made reservations for 6:30 but arrived early to grab cocktails at the Onyx Bar & sat outside in the patio area watching the sunset...it was very beautiful & romantic. Afterwards we were seated outside in the patio area of the restaurant right next to the fireplace facing the mountain view. Again it was a very beautiful & romantic ambience. 

We started our dinner with complimentary warm hot dinner rolls that were super yummy & addicting. They were freshly baked & were so soft that it melted in your mouth. They were topped poppy seeds & came with butter topped with Hawaiian sea salt...so good! Next we shared a beet, pear, arugula & candied pecan salad. For entrees we had the sea bass topped with braised short rib on a bed of potato risotto and the ""cow of the week"" which was waygu beef with risotto & foie gras. We also ordered the lobster Mac & cheese (it was decent but not memorable). We were pleased with our dinner & it ended with complimentary chocolate covered cheesecake bites. They also gave us a small box of truffles as a gift for our anniversary. Overall the service & staffs were great.

We sat outside, which was very nice. Started the meal with the Lobster-Corn Bisque, which was just spectacular-burst of flavors! It's one of those dishes where it's just not enough and you don't want it to end.

For the second course, I got the Medallion of New York strip loin
 chorizo mac & cheese, which was good but after the Lobster-corn bisque, it was hard to impress me at this point. Their steak wasn't anything special but it was very tender. The chorizo mac & cheese on the other hand was another ""I don't want to finish this"" dish. 

I got the Warm Stonefruit Cobbler cornmeal with honey ice cream for dessert. It was delicious and I finished it even though I was extremely full from my meal. 

I'll definitely go back to try the other dishes!"	1

Everything done with precision and expertise.  You will want to try some things you never had before!  Service impeccable, as one would expect at The Four Seasons.

From the smart wine pairings to the melt in your mouth seabass, my company and I were in complete bliss. Hospitality is their specialty at the Four Seasons and we were treated like VIPs from the minute we walked in the door. We started off with some very unique cocktails in the lounge, the new habanero mescal concoction is definitely not to be missed. I'm a sucker for a dirty martini. The ice cold Titos vodka with the briny blue cheese olives set my whole mood for the night --yah yah yah I was tipsy, don't judge me! We dined on the patio, which in my opinion is the best patio in Arizona. The scenery is beautiful with the mountains and sunset. Nightingales flew around the desert landscape after the sun went down. Precious! 

The food as usual was beyond perfect. My party tried a bit of everything, but the favorite dishes were the ahi tuna appetizer, the lobster bisque, and of course the heavenly seabass. I dream about this meal during the year, so as much as I would like to stray and try something new for my entree, I have to have the seabass. The buttery potato gnocchi paired with the velvety fish is taken to a whole different level with the crispy, savory shreds of oxtail. Never in my life have I had such a perfect dish--and I've tried everything!  We ended the evening with pretty much every dessert on the menu. The hands down favorite here was the vanilla scented marscapone with the hibiscus berries--I WILL FIGURE OUT HOW TO MAKE THIS. We had a tasting of fine Madeira wine which really sealed the deal. Some strong coffee to sober up and then we sadly ended our evening. 

Thank you to the amazing team at Talavera. Our server Juan (pronounced like Wyclef Jean) was knowledgeable, funny, and more than accommodating. We were beyond spoiled for our family reunion. On a personal note, my uncle who joined us just beat cancer this last year and was able to travel from Minneapolis to see us for the first time in two years. You made the visit more than special, it was magical."	2

There was a little order mishap but was quickly and professionally resolved. Dessert we had fruit tart. GET IT. *HAPPY DANCE*

Everything from the service, to the view, to the food was perfect! My husband got the bison and he said it was a Top 3 best meal in his life. I got the chicken which was also delicious. The only downside was that the meal had to end. I've been dreaming about it since last night!!!	2
472	R2fjCEHav7HqIhfBRDWQ9Q	1	1	5	"The view is absolutely breath taking! Watching the sunset over the mountains while having a decadent dinner was super romantic. 
Chef Mel greeted our table and the service was superb. The servers were as excited talking about the food as we were to eat it. 
We started with the foie gras. It was perfectly seared and the savoriness was nicely complimented by the sweetness of the peach pound cake and rhubarb chutney. 
Next we got a seared scallop, compliments of the chef and servers. It's hard to find well executed scallops and these were superb! The sear on the outside had a nice crispness. 
I had the Chilean sea bass. The kitchen definitely knows how to cook their fish. It was moist and flakey  with a good char. The potato risotto was on the cusp of being over seasoned but was silky and melted like butter. 
My partner got the cut of the week which was a bone in filet. It was cooked to perfection. The squash and mole complimented it well. The lobster mac and cheese was made with havarti. It was deliciously creamy. 
We got the chocolate soufflé for dessert. My partner really loved it. I am not a fan of chocolate but I can only imagine it's the stuff chocolate fanatics dream about. 
Tip: during the summer go between six and seven to maximize the view. Watching the sky turn from blue to lavender to fire was awesome."	2

I informed the staff ahead of the time and they prepared a menu with a Happy 26th on it with her name, and they offered to have it signed by the Head Chef and gave it a very romantic looking bow.  When we first entered, they greeted us both by name and wished my lady a Happy Birthday.  Umm YES! Way to make me look like a stud.  Then we decided to ball out and try their 6 course tasting menu.  That was definitely the right move.  We paired it was an absolutely superb Malbec and were delighted from course to course as we went on an extended surf and turf meal.  To say it was sublime would be an understatement.  This is one of the meals that I will remember forever, and that in its essence is worthy of five stars.  Yes, it is expensive and because of that price you must raise your expectations.  Talavera exceeded all of my expectations and more.  Can't wait to dine here again!	1

The menu featured autumnal flavors.  I had soup, the lobster trio and for an entree The Three Sisters, which were scallops.

I love seeing Native American culture succeed at this level, so for me it's both an artistic and culinary experience. I thought the scented fog experience at the end of the meal was a nice touch.

I've learned to pace myself at this restaurant. The food is some of the richest I've ever eaten. Taking a couple acidophilus beforehand helps. I ended up bringing home two large 'doggy' bags, only partly because I couldn't eat it all. My experience is when you ask to take something home from this restaurant, you're going to get home and find LOTS of wonderful surprises!"	0
481	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	2	1	4	"Because my home state of California stupidly banned the sustainable foie gras, I had to find a restaurant during my vacation in Arizona that had foie. The law is stupid because banning the barely produced and consumed foie is another step in the wrong direction of letting the morality of a select few control our food when we should be more concerned with human safety along with livestock safety - like chickens fed with grains that are laced with antibiotics, caffeine, prozac, etc. which, in turn, negatively impacts human biology.

Obviously, we ordered every foie gras dish on the menu and turned the start of the meal into a foie gras tasting.

The seared foie gras was a lovingly big and luscious piece of fatty liver with a clever and yummy white powder of foie. The rest of the dish was an abundant amount of various forms of sweet with funnel cake, apple and pear preserve, Port and Saguaro syrup sauce, and banana cream. Take away the foie and it sounds like a dessert. The heavy use of sweet was recurring in chef Joshua Johnson's cooking.

The duck duo was a dance between sweet and spice with the lightly bruleed foie gras torchon (sweet), the duck rillette (spicy), the raspberry and chile jam (sweet), the canele of chili and golden raisins (sweet). The four parts of the dish were individually good, but the overkill of ingredients caused problems where the rillette clashed with the jam. Again, sweetness was aggressively used.

The quail and rabbit dish was highlighted by the wonderful piquillo pepper sauce and tomatillo crema. The dark smoked quail breast was better than the salty rabbit. I'm not sure what made the cornbread ""60 Day"", but it was moist and not sweet to provide a good foundation for the plate.

The most traditional dish of the night was the elk loin wrapped in Iberico lomo. By adding truffle risotto, wild mushrooms, Comte cheese, and truffle sauce, the focus was on earthiness. I liked the dish because it was the least sweet plate of the evening. But when there was a lack of sweet, the kitchen replaced it with too much salt just like the quail and rabbit dish. It was a shame because the meat and risotto were otherwise perfectly executed.

The pecan coated lamb was dry and oddly placed on a thick layer of olive tapenade and a hard puff pastry. The seeds and aromatic spices from a refined and elegant mole sauce adventurously tried to tie the dish together and succeeded with the nutty lamb, but not with the olives.

For dessert, the fry bread puffs were like round churros coated in vanilla sugar. Piped with lemon cream and served with a side of bright lemon and blackberry sorbet, it was a solid dessert. It was also a big dessert where the 8 doughnut-like holes were too much for two people.

The kitchen is trying to attain a very high bar with complex dishes. Unfortunately, fancy food doesn't win points with me, but flavorful food does. So when the flavors on savory dishes slant towards being either too sweet or too salty, I lose interest. I appreciate the work and use of unique ingredients which contributed to the 4-stars, but the dishes were too fussy.

Although there are three courses on the menu, ""The Birth"", ""The Beginnings"", and ""The Journey"", ordering a dish from each section is too much food. ""The Birth"" and ""The Beginnings"" were appetizer-like dishes and ""The Journey"" was entrées.

With $20 appetizers, $48 entrees, and $15 desserts, this is not for the budget conscious. The many amenities like the bottled water, three types of bread, a smooth amuse of mushroom mousse, sorbet palate cleanser, chocolate truffles, pulling up the car before leaving the restaurant, free valet parking, and stocking the car with chocolate squares and water helped to justify the $371 total tab for two."	1

Having dined here several times for various occasions, whether it was wishing a dear colleague a send off or for business matters, it's the best.  The use of various tribal foods is the heart of and the very essence of Kai.  It represents the hospitality tradition of the Akimel O'odham.	0
483	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	1	5	"Kai is certainly an AZ treasure. I had forgotten how really great the place is, but had the opportunity to dine there again recently. What sets it apart is the seamless quality of the food and service.

With regards to food, it is loosely variations on native american fare. However, there are lots of luxury twists, such as seared foie gras, escargot, etc. We chose to order individual dishes, but there are two extensive tasting menus that can be paired with wine. Perhaps the most beautiful was a composed salad ""From the Garden"". The mains we enjoyed most were the ""Coriander-Sumac Spiced Rack of Lamb"" and ""Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo"", which we ordered mid-rare.

The cocktails were outstanding. I had a riff on an old fashioned which and they also sampled us the ""Smokey Almond"" which I would certainly recommend. The wine list is extensive and tends to be pricey, but the wine service itself is perfect.

Service is a level above anything else I've experienced in Arizona. The attitude is one of graciousness and a peaceful pace, without dragging. The team is very well coordinated, bring out the dishes simultaneously. One never needs to ask for anything as they anticipate your needs. Lots of meaningful touches add up. For instance, the coffee is served table side as either french press or ceramic drip. When you go to you car, you find signature chocolates, Voss water and a handwritten thank you note from the waiter."	1

Our main server, Feliciano and our sommelier, Thomas, along with their able staff, guided us through our journey with professionalism and genuine enthusiasm. They know this territory well and demonstrate their passion for delivering a fine dining experience at every turn.

The meal was exquisite.  Each course was inventive, beautiful and incredibly delicious.  The wine pairings were among the best we have experienced anywhere and were pitch perfect.

We live in New York and we thought we'd experienced this level of dining before, but obviously we had not.  Our stay in Phoenix was brief but Kai is something we'd like to experience again, so we will return when we can.

Of course a meal like this comes at a steep price, but it is worth every penny.  Bravo, Kai.  You guys rock!!!!!"	3
485	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	2	0	5	"I am so glad that I gave this 5 star, 5 diamond restaurant a try. I decided to pamper my Father for Father's Day and had a day at Aji Spa followed by dinner at Kai. It was by far the most magical experience I've ever had while dining. My Father is a restaurateur, 30+ years, who is also a chef and a wine maker, so he was completely blown away with the infusion of flavors, the presentation and the remarkable wine list. Special points that they served Portuguese wine, because we are both Portuguese and my Father actually had been to both vineyards that the wine was from. Our wine connoisseur at our table was very knowledgeable and his pronunciation on the grapes and vineyards was on point, remarkable for him not speaking the Portuguese language.  We had an amazing server by the name of Kevin, he really made the experience extra delightful and I cannot wait to return.

The area is quiet and dimly lit, it's perfect for intimate evenings. The portions are small but incredibly filling, believe me when I say I could barely move after the appetizer portion. They explain all of the ingredients to you, and if artwork was food this would be it.

I loves the surprises they throw in at the end, won't tell you what they are but you get two! Make sure to valet your car and they will validate it for you.

Thank you Kai for making a daughter's attempt for the perfect Father's Day a magical dream come true."	3
486	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	2	2	5	"Mind blown!!! I feel guilty giving anywhere else a five star rating after coming here, because it's in a league of its own. As an expert in fine dining, I can honestly say this is the best restaurant experience in America. Better than Alinea, Eleven Madison Park, and the famous French Laundry. Period. This chef deserves a James Beard Award more than anyone else. It should have multiple Michelin stars.

It's in the beautiful Wild Horse Pass hotel. The decor is modern with Native American influences. The windows allow you to watch the beautiful sunset while you dine. From a view perspective, it's impeccable! The wait staff is incredible. We had 10 different waiters, each of which were unbelievably knowledgeable regarding the menu. They intricately explained each course, the chef's inspiration, and the sourcing of ingredients. The staff bends over backwards to make you feel like royalty.

We did the 13 course tasting menu. They do have abnormal menu and a shorter tasting menu option (only 7 courses). But, I'd highly recommend the 13 courses, as it allows you to try nearly everything. It's called the journey, which is quite fitting.

The courses were as follows:

Foie gras amuse

Hahl soup with 32 hour brisket and prickly pear cotton candy - cotton candy melts as you eat it

Hand picked lettuces

The Preserved Garden

Foie gras and apple pie - The best foie gras I've ever had.

Elixir

Dusted hebi with tuna tartare and squid ink

Festival of seasons NY strip

Coconut taramind palate cleanser sorbet

Tenderloin of tribal buffalo

Cheese course

Deconstructed tiramisu.

Then, they bring local herbs in a wood bowl with rocks and dry ice. They pour tea over to and it smokes for a good 10 minutes, filling the entire room with a relaxing aroma. This was the absolute best culinary feat I've ever seen. More so than Grant Achatz's dessert balloons at Alinea. Epic, purely epic.

So, five hours later, we finished. As if the above experience weren't enough, the chef came out from the kitchen and greeted us. As we left, they put a thank you card, two Voss water bottles, and some homemade jelly in the car. All in all, the best restaurant in America. Well worth the price tag!!"	5

We opted for the ""Short Story"" tasting menu, paired with wines. I have no idea how I'd be able to survive the 11 course ""Journey"" tasting menu. We were dining for just under 2 1/2 hours as it was! We did add the Foie Gras to make it an eight course meal. If you have the time, spirit of adventure and disposable income, I highly recommend this restaurant and menu choice. 
Our server, Feliciano, was as terrific as the food. He made sure all our needs were addressed and each course was described with precise detail. Our Sommelier, whose name I unfortunately don't remember, also did an amazing job pairing some fantastic wines with each course. He took us from Hungary to Argentina, and all points in between. 
Was it the best meal I've ever had? I don't know, but I'm having a hard time remembering a better meal."	1
488	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	Oh my.... this is my favorite restaurant in the world. I can't even put into words how good this experience was. I got two drinks, both out of this world. The first was the grapefruit martini which I'm not a huge grapefruit person and I loved it. The other one I got was the blue mountain. Then they brought us one to share that is their favorite and it was strong and good :) then I did the journey. Wow just wow. I can't explain how amazing of an experience this was. Not one ounce of regret in my mind even when getting the bill. They know what they are doing. They pay attention to everything. They know when you are remotely low on water. They escort you to the bathroom. We got to know each other Pretty well from doing the journey. It was bittersweet leaving st the end. Amazing experience please try if you ever have the opportunity!!!! You will not regret it!!	0

Extremely well - trained and - versed on the components of each dish.  We started with a small tuna plate and bread serviced complimentary with dinner.  The tuna was of excellent grade with a favorable but not overpowering sauce.  Bread was good except a small piece of course native bread that tasted like a hard whole grain dumpling.  We each ordered a salad mine was mainly beets and fermented earth.  Different but tasty.  My husband's salad was mainly tomato aspect with greens and cheese.  The chef was kind enough to forgo the olives and mushrooms.  After the salad we were provided a small sorbet, perfect is the only word.  For my main, I had the scallops which were cooked medium just to my liking.  I did not care for the curry sauce on the pasta.  Just my taste buds.  My husband ordered the lamb and liked everything on the plate except the lamb as it was overcooked and slightly tough.  The ending was nothing short of spectacular.  I was provided a beet chocolate raspberry desert, yum.  Afterwards we has a few chocolates and a dry ice herb show.  The best restaurant in the valley for a special occasion.	0

You might think that eleven courses and four hours is overkill. But you would be wrong. The service is paced and never rushed. Each serving is small but enough to throughly enjoy each delectable item. If you want an outstanding dining experience, this is your place. The staff went well beyond what you might expect with even high standards. We even got a nice surprise at the valet when we got our car. It was expensive, but worth it."	0
491	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	2	4	"It's so hard to say a restraurant is amazing when the hype has been built up so much. It dares you to be disappointed. I am still not sure (a month later) which camp I fall into. I've heard such amazing things about Kai from so many people in the Valley - friends, husband, co-workers, clients. All of those amazing things people have told me are true. The service, drinks, dinner, dessert - they were all amazing. I guess I'm disappointed because they didn't stand out in their amazingness. Does that even make sense? I'll try to explain. 

For example, the ambience & decor are top notch. Soft music, luxurious & spacious dining room, hip bar - but the place just feels like, I don't know, like it's missing its soul. Kai just feels & looks like another great Arizona restraurant. It's subtly southwest, but you could be at the Camelback Inn or the Pointe. You don't get the feeling you're at a Casino (although that's actually down the street, huh?) or on an Indian reservation - you could be in North Scottsdale or Downtown Phoenix. I don't know, something was just missing. It's hard for me to describe or even put my finger on. Look at their virtual tour & see if you agee.

Kai does better in the actual food & menu - it's pretty clear that organic farming & using good quality ingredients from the Gila River Indian Community are a cornerstone of the menu - it's written in every description. Our party enjoyed both surf & turf - so we had a good representation off the menu with appetizers & desserts. Every entree was wonderful & there were no leftovers! But, again, I was left feeling......something, what? The dishes were inspired by Native American culture, but in the end - I couldn't really tell the difference between the ""inspired"" tenderloin & one from Durant's or Mastro's. The difference between the local micro green salad & one grown in California. Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if the dishes were more authentic to Arizona's various Native American tribes. Taking a real tribal staple or favorite dish & then giving it an amazing executive chef's touch or re-inventing it - that to me would truely make Kai unique. Serving lobster, dry aged rib eye, truffles, & scallops just sounds like every other expensive, five star restraurant in the Valley & probably in any large US city. What's uniquely Native American or Arizonan about that?

Some ideas - maybe if they changed the decor, hired an Arizonan Native American chef, created an avant garde signature dish from a tribal staple, or gave your party a handmade arts & craft talisman made by the local tribes instead of a hand written Thank you on stationary?? I don't know. I think Kai just needs to be more innovative & create a dining experience that a local or visitor can't get at any other restaurant in the Valley of the Sun. Take themselves out of the five star restaurant competition by giving the guest something completely different & cutting edge.

In short, I think Kai is just missing that 'je ne sais quoi'. After all the great reviews & hype, I felt Kai fell short. I was expecting an authentic, uniquely Arizonan Native American dining experience & got an amazing, delicious dinner at a five star restraurant. Great dinner, but not really unique or innovative."	2
492	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"I would definitely recommend Kai. Yes, it is expensive. But, the experience is so worth it! I had the Short Story, which is the 7-course meal.  

Amuse - I couldn't tell you what this was, but it was tasty. It had a piece of asparagus with nuts.
Mesquite Ha:l Soup - The presentation is beautiful. The cotton candy gets melted right in front of you with the soup.
Three Sisters - The scallop was cooked perfectly.
Intermezzo - The sorbet was refreshing.
Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo - The tenderloin was fork tender. The smoked corn puree was delicious and the chorizo was on another level.   
Global Artisan Cheese - I had two cheeses. One was mild, can't remember the name and the other was a type of blue cheese. I enjoyed them with some honey and crackers.
Dessert - The dessert was sorbet and too pretty to eat. Of course, I ate it all.

This was the best culinary experience of my life. Everything was perfect! I felt like I was a judge on Iron Chef America. The presentation was beautiful. Yes, the food is different, because it's not a steakhouse. So, you have to be open to eating locally farmed ingredients and Native American inspired dishes. The menu is showcased on a piece of Mesquite with a watercolor painting from a local Native American artist. The view of the sunset was breathtaking.     

The service was excellent. They push in your chair and place the napkin on your lap. We never had to wait for a refill. The service explains every course to you. Jackson was our server and he was great! He even walked me out of the restaurant to show me the restroom. At the end of our meal, they gave us four chocolate truffles. And, a handwritten ""thank you"" card from Jackson. If you are tired of going to steakhouses and feel adventurous, this is definitely the place."	1
493	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	2	1	5	"Kai Restaurant is a Forbes Travel Guide five star and a five diamond AAA restaurant located in Chandler Arizona. 

Kai specializes in cuisine that is Native American tribal inspired sourcing as much regional ingredients as possible. The menu changes with the seasons and this season the menu features many different proteins such as elk, buffalo, pork, lamb and more. 

I found that the service was attentive and impeccable. Besides enjoying a shop stopping dinner this event also was slightly educational from the interpretations of menu paintings described by our server.

Dinner takes about three hours without the multi course tastings. Several amuse bouche are served and tribal flute music plays in the background.

I do note although they say they can accommodate anyone. I am not certain that they actually offer any vegetarian plates. Possibly only one of the salads might be vegetarian style but the other as I was surprised to find out after it was sitting in front of me that it  had squid in it. Ironically the salad was named, ""From The Garden"" I sure wasn't expecting squid and my server offered to make me a new one or get something else. I don't feel it's necessary to remove a star for this one fault since the salad was so absolutely stunning. 

I received the most sophisticated breath taking salad I've ever seen before that truly looked as if it was growing up from a garden with fancy vegetables I've never seen before like a small green with a fuzzy bright red top that I was told was some sort of spinach. The salad was delightful and looked magical. I was told it was a small plate and it was much larger than I expected it to be. 

For dinner I had the Chimayo Rubbed Dry Aged New York Stirp that came with horseradish potatoes gratin, creamed spinach, heirloom carrots with bordelaise sauce. The steak wasn't the most succulent steak I've ever had but it did have a really great crust on it that was very unique. The portion was very large for me and after eating enough I took home close to 7 ounces of steak. Heirlooms carrots were scented with vanilla or something that reminded me of vanilla. I thought the creamed spinach was very good but the potatoes gratin was slightly over salted. 

My husbands Elk Loin wrapped in Iberico seemed like a much more complex dinner and I went green with envy when they shaved fresh truffles over it.

Peanut butter in  mousse towers, peanut sponge cakes, crunchy peanut brittle dust and Jelly Dessert was many layers of peanut taste and very grown up jelly. Blackberry five spice sorbet, poached grapes and red wine hibiscus drops adorned the plate. This dessert really was amazing. It wasn't too sweet and was just right and had many different textures and was delicious.

Waiting for us in the car was a handwritten Thank You Card from the server, two bottles of water and a box of chocolates.

If you attended Devoured this year you might have picked up a card from Kai that would give each guest a complimentary glass of wine and a complimentary appetizer. For two people that adds up to a $70. savings. If you still have your card now is the time to try Kai if you were thinking of doing so."	4
494	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	The food was so enticing that we stuffed ourselves over capacity. The specialty martinis were also fantastic. Both drinks and food used interesting flavor combinations that I hadn't had before. While not strictly native american (e.g. had lobster and caviar as ingredients), all the dishes and drinks had elements or ingredients that were locally based. The decor is based on traditional native american design and all the menus have hand painted pictures depicting some element of native american life. Our servers were excellent. They were knowledgeable about the different dishes and gave us cultural background throughout the night. We were also blown away to find a box of chocolates, fancy water, and a hand written card from our server in our car when we picked it up from valet.	2
495	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	If you want a true fine dining experience this is it.  It is well worth the money. Right from the start to the way you are treated by the valet to the incredible service and food experience.  There are two waiters per person...they don't hover but are right there if you want something. The Native American   Influence and foods are a delightful experience and the food was without fault . I had a lobster dish that was sweet and tasty  The bottles of water and chocolates in the car at the end of the meal are a nice treat and ending to an exceptional evening.	1

The food was definitely different but it was pretty good, but it was all a little overpriced for my liking and whilst I did appreciate the great presentation I didn't want to have to pay that much for the meal. However, the service at the restaurant was really great. 

The staff at the restaurant were really friendly and had great personalities which really did make the experience much better and I would definitely go to the restaurant again but it won't be my first choice and while I definitely appreciate and thank the staff for the great service the price was too much for me especially since the food could have definitely been better."	0

The reservations were at 730pm. the sun was just setting, the night sky was absolutely gorgeous as you look over the mountains in Scottsdale.It was a hunt to find the place too, which made for a fun story later.
My drink was a lemoncello with a hot chili that was to die for. We had the 'short story' which was only 7 courses :-)  Handpainted ,wood, menus, each menu with a different story told in watercolors. 1 server for each person at our table. Food, incredible.

It is evident that the chef and the staff put a lot of thought into making every expect of your dining experience perfect. The food is incredibly delicious, the presentation beautiful, and the service is absolutely top notch.

Two examples to illustrate the level of attention to detail:

- One of the dishes I had was an appetizer dish, lobster done three ways, from chilled, to room temperature, to warm. The food itself was INCREDIBLE. I went more than a year ago, so I don't remember a lot of the details, but suffice to say I still dream about that dish. But what I want to highlight here is the utensil that came with the dish. It was chilled, and warmed in your hand at the exact right pace as you worked your way through each of the three preparations. That was mind blowing for me. I've been to plenty of 2- and 3-michelin starred restaurants in different cities in the US, and some would chill the spoon that came with the sorbet palette cleanser. I have yet to experience what I experienced at Kai anywhere else.

- Our car was waiting for us outside of the hotel lobby when we were finished with dinner. Inside we found two bottles of VOSS water, a box of chocolate, and a card from our server thanking us for dining at Kai. 

My friend who dined with me promptly sent a thank-you card back, to both the waiter as well as restaurant management. It was THAT good.

If you live in the Phoenix area, I envy you. :) But, I will probably see you at Kai soon, as I'm perfectly willing to get on a plane, just to eat at Kai."	1
505	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"It is truly a unique and remarkable dining experience. Celebrating our anniversary, we traversed all the way from Peoria and it was worth the trek and definite subsequent visits. I would consider the staff more as guides than waiters. Their knowledge and professionalism exemplified excellence while also maintaining a pleasant friendliness. The food, oh the food. Phenomenal? Orgasmic? Divine? Existing words don't do it justice. The complex layers of flavor in combination proved to be a delightful journey for the palate. A definite must for everyone's  ""Bucket List""!"	0
506	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"Visited by myself after noting the restaurant was listed as a AAA five diamond restaurant. I don't know where to begin, but I cannot say enough good things. I'll start with it is worth the drive if you are contemplating making the 30-45 minute drive from the Phoenix-Scottsdale area.

Upon arriving for my reservation, I was greeted by valet, who gave me a ticket and directed me to Kai after I informed them it was my first time visiting. Along the walk, the gentleman concisely informed me on various aspects of the property before handing me off to the hostess that sat me at my table. Once at my table, I noticed the Native American influenced decor and observed the impeccable service delivered throughout the night as I sat behind other diners where everyone faced the same way.

In the dimly lit restaurant, I received nothing short of exceptional service where each complementary dish was explained and there was no guessing on where the food was sourced from as it was all explained, which was a nice touch. I ordered a glass of cabernet that paired well with my Bison Tenderlion featuring smoked corn puree, cholla buds, chorizo, scarlet runner bean chile, and dots saguaro blossom syrup provided by the native tribe.

The eclectic food from the Native American Kai tribe was worth every cent. The experience was noteworthy and one I will never forget."	1
507	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	1	5	"This is a 7 STAR REVIEW. Here is the real, honest to goodness truth. I've done tons of reviews. I've given some 5 stars before. Now that I've been to Kai, I literally feel that I need to go back and move all others down a full star. Kai is by far, that good and the absolute best food and experience I've ever had. It's simply not fair to put other 5 star Yelp reviews on par with this restaurant. I'm a food lover, a dining experience lover. Honestly, I kind of prefer the hole-in-the-wall places, mom and pop, casual. Kai may have changed me,...no, it did change me. I have a new appreciation for restaurants like this. It was beyond tremendous. I truly believe it may have ruined me on other ""really nice"" restaurants. I would hate to be the next ""really nice"" restaurant I go to because there is absolutely no-way it will measure up to Kai.

Bottom line, this was the best ""dining experience"" of my life. And I've been to some nice places in some pretty cool countries. Why?

Service: absolutely impeccable. All plates served and cleared at the same time. Silverware heated/chilled to appropriate temperature for your next dish. Sommelier was spot on, picked the exact wine I described we'd like that night, absolutely perfect.

Wait staff: friendly, incredibly knowledgeable, polite, timely, genuine. Best I've ever had, ever, anywhere, hands down. 

Food: Carefully, lovingly prepared by what are clearly experts, with the absolute best, freshest, highest quality ingredients in the perfect amounts. Best tasting, robust, full, absolutely incredible. We were worried portion sizes would be small. Worried for nothing, we were stuffed, perfect!

Atmosphere: peaceful, comfortable, soft, warm, comforting, soft music, lots of space, clean. Simply unreal

Value: honestly, for the service, quality, quantity and the entire experience, this is the best value there is, worth every penny and not excessively priced. I've had much less for much more money.

No kidding, if I could afford to eat here EVERY NIGHT, hands down, I would do it.

I honestly wish there was a 6 star option,...or 7. This is just like the Tesla Model S P85D breaking the Consumer Reports Rating Scale. It only goes to 100 and the car scored 103. That is Kai, better than the best.

If you have to forego 5 restaurants to save to go to Kai, do it! Don't miss this restaurant, whatever you do."	5

All of us thoroughly enjoyed our meals.  I had the lamb entree which was prepared with a Mexican mole sauce.  Very tasty.  The others at my table are all picky eaters, but they enjoyed their meals as well (seafood pasta, buffalo, and red snapper).  We ended the meal with a delicious chocolate lava cake.  The menu changes based on what's in season.  The dishes are prepared with all local ingredients from local farms and areas.

When I returned to my room that night at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass there was a box of chocolates and a thank you note waiting for me from our waiter.  Talk about attention to detail.

Our lead waiter Kevin was fabulous and such a joy to have throughout the dinner. The food? Well you will not experience cuisine much better than this, especially in the States. Each course was delightful and amazingly flavorful in its own way. Don't even get me started on the Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras. Kevin described it like dessert and I never would have thought foie gras could be so magnificent! It's a must try when you go. From the Journey (our main entrees) my husband ordered the Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo and I ordered the High Country Elk Loin. Both were delightful, but if I had to choose one the Tribal Buffalo was pretty outstanding. I've read mixed reviews on the sensory experience, but I have only positive things to say. My husband and I love to spend hours at a dinner such as this and the sensory experience only added to our time at Kai. I could go on and on, but overall just know if you find yourself in the Phoenix area try Kai. It's worth the drive and cost! Also, book a reservation well in advance.	0

The wait staff's attention to detail is amazing.  They provided great information and seemed genuinely delighted to share information and answer questions on the Indian culture, foods and wine.

The food was phenomenal. As each dish was presented, the staff explained each component.  The use of Native American food throughout the menu is delicious as well as fascinating.  Unique and delightful tastes wait on every plate. The Buffalo tenderloin and Elk Loin was delicious.

Everything was perfect - from the moment we were greeted by the hostess to be seated to the point when we got into our car with chocolates and bottled waters waiting for us inside. The the ""high end"" restaurants in the city of Vancouver really needs to learn a thing or two from Kai. Our server was great; the ambiance was really calm; and the amazing food came with an amazing view (we were lucky to be seated in front of the window that over looked the back of the Sheraton). The dinning experience was unique with their synchronized table service and Native American fine dinning of amazing food. I can't remember the dishes of the appetizers that we had but I do remember it being amazing - mine had fois gras on it. My trio of seafood main was also amazing - the scallops and lobster were cooked perfectly. The chef gave us a complimentary dessert even though we ordered one ourselves. It's a shame that the chef's complimentary chocolate dessert wasn't on the menu because it was better than the chocolate dessert we ordered off of the menu. 

I can not say enough good things about this restaurant. I would come back to the Phoenix area just to eat here again."	0
521	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	1	4	"After wanting to visit this restaurant for over a year, this past September I made reservations for a Saturday night.  OpenTable.com made the process of reserving a table very easy.

Now the part that brought this review down.

Someone from the restaurant had called the day of our reservation, however no one left a voicemail with their name and/or phone number.  Since I don't typically get phone calls from the Phoenix area, I called the number back and was directed to the Sheraton's front desk (not directly related to Kai) where a pleasant lady was able to confirm my reservation.  My husband and I ran late on our reservation, which prompted someone from the restaurant to call us. Again, when I checked my phone, there was a one second voicemail which did not include the caller's name/phone numbers, but again, thankful for caller ID, I called the number and let a different lady know we would be up shortly. So, suggestion #1) have a directly line to your restaurant and #2) please train your staff to please leave their name and contact info when they are unable to reach guests by phone. I think this is only common curtsey for a restaurant known with the best reputation in the whole Arizona state.

Once we walked up to the front desk I must say it was a little awkward meeting a group of young girls. I wasn't quite sure who was checking my party in, but I was impressed that once we were checked in, we were guided to our table and very politely we welcomed as Mr. and Mrs. Salvador.  

Our main servers for the night were Quenton and I believe Richard. Quenton was very knowledgable about the restaurant's traditions and community projects and gave us a quick rundown of how their establishment partners with many local farms and artists to inspire their food and overall atmosphere.  He then left us to review the menu.  Unfortunately this is where I must make suggestion #3) please do not let your guests wait more than 10 minutes to place their order. While we were enjoying some entertaining people watching, we were hungry and we're excited to begin eating.  Having to wait such a long time to place our order was frankly annoying.

For this meal we ordered the Short Story tasting menu with an additional dish of foie gras since we can no longer order foie in California.

Here is a list of what we ate:
-Bruleed fig: Parmesan crisp, Brie, bourbon pecan butter, candied sage
-mesquite charred pumpkin & squash purée: mesquite bean glazed furor pork belly, ahi Amarillo, compressed squash, nopales, and tart apple spume
-potpourri of butter braised lobster, guaymas shrimp & diver scallops: black threads of past, braised tomato, cauliflower and leek fondue, shaved aged gruyere cheese, ham hock bits, and crispy shallots
-seared Hudson Valley foie gras with spiced pumpkin funnel cake: powdered foie gras sugar, caramel iced quince & Bosc pear preserve, aged port and saguaro syrup reduction
-mango-guava and ancho sorbet: raspberry and ginger syrup
-grilled tenderloin of tribal buffalo: smoked corn purée, cholla buds, chorizo and scarlet runner bean chili, and saguaro blossom syrup
-assortment of French cheeses
-two sisters squash air cake: 60-day corn ice cream, mesquite syrup, smoked corn purée, Ramona Farms ga'lvsa, tarragon and amaranth
-Guatemalan coffee
-assortment of chocolate bonbons 

Despite some of the initial flaws I experienced with the waitstaff, I must give credit to the kitchen staff, for they surely are the stars of this establishment!  The food was almost flawless (the pumpkin and squash purée could have been puréed into a smoother consistency), our overall meal was quite beautiful visually and texturally.  The waitstaff acted in great precision as each dish was presented to each guest at the same time, kind of like a well orchestrated dance.  There were moments where my palate wasn't expecting some of the flavor combos, but they were all quite delightful.  There was a definitely moments of surprise throughout this meal!

I would actually rate this restaurant as a 3.5 given the reasons above (some communication misfires and overall extended wait time), but what rounded it up was the well executed food that we enjoyed.

Thank you Kai for an enjoyable meal."	0

NOTHING I can write nor words can explain the superior level of service you will receive along with the amazing food you will eat.  My 2nd visit to Kai was in December of 2014 and they remembered (from my first visit a month prior) that I had requested almond milk for my coffee because of my dietary restriction.  Their chef literally made the almond milk from scratch by hand that night.  Fast forward ONE YEAR LATER to my dinner there last night with two of my best girlfriends and co-workers.  I ordered my coffee and without asking, they delivered a creamer containing coconut cream (which is a secondary option for my diet) and actually my preferred coffee creamer.  You just can't get that kind of attention to detail anywhere else!  Their staff works in unison like an amazing flock of birds, and the food is prepared to perfection.  They will make you feel like family, which makes you choose them each and every time for your next, and next, and next elegant dining experiences.  Thank you Kai for another incredible evening.  Well done!!	0

Everything was beyond excellent with the exception of the dessert.
The cake portion of the combination seemed to be lacking in flavor.
However, each course, from the soup on was perfect. All the dishes and utensils were at the correct temperature to be served with the course. Service was impeccable. 
The wine parings were exceptional.
Very pricey, but you get what you pay for. Awesome view and room as well."	0

The journey started upon our arrival and the note and water left in the vehicle are the little things that make an evening memorable.  The story was descriptive and thorough and any questions were welcomed and answered in great detail.  The whole team, from the front of the house , to the kitchen, made the experience unforgettable. If you need an escape, I highly recommend an evening at Kai.	0

532	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	You would be hard pressed to find a better place to eat in the country.  It's starts with amazing views, goes to the hand painted menus each with it's own story, continues into the regionally inspired cocktails and then takes off with the food.  Each dish has just the right touch of Southwest ingredients and they are executed to perfection.  Oysters and caviar - delicious.  Love escargot.  The lobster and foie gras were equally decadent.  Everything was great, but the Buffalo tenderloin is clearly the star.  The service is top notch.  We went for a birthday and they brought out an amazing chocolate souffle for our birthday girl.  Outstanding evening.	1
533	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"Excellent service, beautiful display of food and very tasty.  Love the cultural background of the history of Native American influence. Staff was definitely the 5 star service as stated.  Friends had the salmon or white fish, and I had a New York Strip.  It was a little tough and they replaced with a reorder, then no charge on that because it took so long. Gave us desserts and just so accommodating.  Wine steward was knowledgeable but young, which was o.k. Highly, highly recommend it.  The hotel is going through renovation so the ""view"" of the mountains was covered up by drapes, so you feel a little bit in the closet, but the service made it worthwhile and food.  Remodel is just temporary and will be magnificent soon."	0

Yes, worth it.  Why?  You really are invited to ""experience"" the food at Kai.  The staff are very formally trained (which can seem theatrical), but really when you consider the atmosphere, which features local beautiful arts & crafts as well as probably the best sunset views in the area, the flavors and presentation of the food (practically perfect), the slightly stiff staff presentations can be forgiven.  Plus, you can dress up! (but don't under-do it).

Part of the fun going into this dinner was the fact that my husband and I hadn't read anything about the restaurant, knew absolutely nothing about anything, but decided to go because we were staying at the resort and were there for a special occasion anyway.  They also had availability when we wanted to eat there and managed a reservation the night before for 5:45 PM (we were there until 8:30 PM).  Boy, were we in for a surprise!

We each ordered an item from the three courses: Birth, Beginning, and Journey.  For a total of 6 dishes between the two of us we were well fed for the price of about two of the 5-course meals; but because we went a la carte, we had a little more control over the selection, had more to share between the two of us, and were able to pass on the dessert (really unnecessary).

I can't get too detailed on each food item, because the menu is always changing.  But I will say that the husband and I were pretty much blown away by every selection.  The portions were large in terms of fancy restaurants; so shareable at every level (birth, beginning, and journey), but it was really fun to share between the two of us.  The presentation of the food, particularly the items from Birth and Beginning, was gorgeous.  The preparation of the food was just about perfect in terms of flavor complexity and techniques.  I was worried that the Journey would be disappointing because everything else was just unstoppable, but the meats were cooked exactly to our specifications.

If you're curious of the types of foods offered here, let me reiterate that the menu changes.. but some of the items included on our menu were foie gras, escargot, fry bread (so good), roasted vegetables, local cheeses, lobster, sheep, NY strip steak, Big Eye Tuna, Scallops, Duck, Tribal Buffalo, Elk Loin, Lamb; and techniques included molecular gastronomy, french...  In addition, the amuse bouche and intermezzo were a complimentary inclusion to our a la carte selection."	6

Deliciousness - 5/5.

Oh my gosh you guys. Ohmygosh! I can't help but add to the insane amount of hype for this place. Kai earns it all, and more.

First, I'm not an elitist snobby guy. Like some of you, I rolled my eyes when reading the reviews calling it an ""experience."" Well - shame on me. It absolutely lives up to the billing.

The service is top notch. Artistic menus, gorgeous scenery outside of giant picture windows, staff all along the walls, finding a way to meet dietary needs, and then fresh (and free) biscuits and bottled water in my car when we were done (we didn't even have to call the valet, they do it for you). But what makes it an experience, beyond the out-of-this-world service, is that they try to engage all your senses. Calming Native American music. They brought out a basket of herbs that they poured hot tea on that filled (and cleansed) your nose and that activated dry ice to entice your eyes. How's that for an experience?!

I've focused so much on the service, but the food lives up to the rating and the price. The foie gras really is to die for. My wife is pretty ""meh"" about foie gras, and ended up eating more than I did (to my chagrin). They gave us a free dessert and palate cleansers, which was so generous. I had the bison, which was probably the best cuts of bison I've ever had. 

This place is expensive but you get every cent's worth out of it. Highly recommended, even if you only make it there once."	0
536	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"I can't say enough good things about Chi! I will start with the service. We were greeted at the entrance of the hotel and escorted to the restaurant promptly seated. 

The we were there for my sisters birthday and the staff greeted us by our names and wished my sister a happy birthday. 

The both chose the ""Short Story"" 6 course tasting paired with 2 glasses of Riesling...it was out of this world! Great flavor profiles and the dishes with spice had just enough to enjoy but not overpowering. 

I had questions about the Michelin star system and the staff had a manger come over who was so knowledgeable and explained everything to me. The other staff engaged in conversation about wines etc...it was so fun as a foodie to ""talk shop"" with these people! 

It's all about the little extra touches...a birthday candle on an additional complimentary dessert, a gift when you leave, a signed bday card for my sister, our free valet waiting for us when we walked outside, and a bottle of water and parting gift waiting in the car for us! Just complete top notch service on all fronts! Feliciano and Robert were beyond fantastic!

537	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	Jeremy and his team of wait staff are amazing. Their breadth of knowledge, sequential movements, attention to detail are second to none. I am originally from New York city let me tell you this restaurant exceeds even the 3 star Michelin restaurants like Per Se, Daniel, Le Bernadin, etc. I would come back to Arizona just for this place, it is THAT good. The ambience, scenery, service and dishes were all impeccable!!	0
538	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"Hands down, the best meal I've ever had in my life.   Also hands down the most expensive, but the experience, the flavors, the service, all worth every penny.  

Kai blends a Native American base theme with locally grown and locally sourced ingredients to create dishes that are simply out of this world.    The Lobster Degustation we started with was sublime.  The menu describes it as three items,  ""Butter Braised Tail, Avocado Mousse, Tear Drop Salsa & Lobster Coral Lobster Knuckles in Sweet Corn Panna Cotta with Sour Radishes, Lobster Cobbler with Mesquite Meal & Burnt Irish Porter Cheese"".  I describe it as simply ridiculous in its enjoyability.

I had a Buffalo steak which was very lean yet incredibly tender.  My wife had the Ribeye steak, which was borderline too fatty, but the flavor and texture were outstanding.  The house-made barbecue sauce should be bottled and sold.

My dessert was the ""Two Sisters Squash Air Cake"", with ""60-Day Corn Ice Cream, Mesquite Syrup, Smoked Corn Puree, Ramona Farms Ga'Ivsa, Tarragon and Amaranth"".  What the menu doesn't say is the dish is delivered under a bell filled with Applewood smoke.   Wow.  Unexpected, and exceptionally different.  

Make no mistake:  Dining here is an investment in time and money.   It is not inexpensive in any way shape or form.  But if you're willing to invest in flavors and textures and service you're not likely to experience in many places, and certainly not anywhere else here in the Valley, then make a reservation and be prepared to be awestruck."	2

My husband and I shared a primary course of Arctic Char cooked perfectly with a seared crust and moist inside. Accompanied with native beans and corn in a wonderful sauce. 
We then inhaled the lobster cooked three ways. Poached in butter, as part of a salad with a vanilla vinaigrette, and as part of a flan with buttered breadcrumbs.
Next was the Lamb tenderloin wrapped in pecans enhanced by a mole sauce and squash accompaniment. The Buffalo tenderloin was perfection offset by a corn purée and smoky mushroom flavor.
Native breads were served to round out the flavors.
No over the top molecular gastronomy here just chefs who passionately bring you to a land  indicative of the region they love.

541	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	"Let me start by saying that if you are looking for a memorable way to celebrate a birthday, anniversary or any other special event and are willing to spend a couple hundred dollars per person, stop looking for a restaurant and book your reservation here!

This restaurant is absolutely spectacular! A fine dining experience unlike anything else I have ever experienced!

The entire staff ensures that ever detail of your entire dining experience is flawless.

My wife and I celebrated her birthday here and I can't think of any restaurant we have been to in the world that I would rather return to for future special events. Aside from the service, the food is also a revelation with every bite of every dish being one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth!

I won't list everything we ordered, but whatever you do, don't miss the Potato soup (forgive me for not remembering the fancy name) or the escargot! I really love that each dish is described for you as it is being placed in front of you, so you are never left wondering, ""what was that small thing on the side I just ate?""

After an amazing meal, I love that our server chose our deserts for us based on what we had ordered for our other courses! Through conversation and our discussions about the other dishes, they made perfect selections for my wife (the chocolate mousse) and for me, an incredible smoked pecan pie that they serve under a dome, releasing a huge puff of hickory smoke right at your table to inhale and start the dish!

I won't share all the small details of how they turn a fine dining experience into a memorable evening as I think that for those not accustomed to truly fine dining, the small details they pay attention to are more enjoyable if they come as a surprise.

Bar service is top notch (knowledgeable and super friendly) and live music adds to the already perfect ambiance. We come for every special occasion, and 'just because'. Make it part of a weekend staycation at the Wild Horse (resort, not casino, though that's fun too!), throw in a spa day and you'll be as hooked as we are!	0

By far the most wonderful Foie Gras I've ever eaten has been here and I also had a Buffalo Tartare that knocked my socks off.  Their duck is sublime and I really love how they tie in native ingredients and menu items.  T

he attention to detail in Kai is absolutely mind blowing including chilling or heating your silverware based on the temp of your next dish.  They table crumb and even have a person paying attention to how the sunset gazes upon the inside of the restaurant so they can ensure you never have sun in your eyes... all the while making sure they do not obstruct your view of the beautiful desert in full view.  

If you book a private room I can assure you that you will feel like a champ.  We had eight people and each dish was placed down simultaneously by eight waiters.  Everything is impeccable from the minute you arrive to the minute you hop back on the road.  One of those wonderful examples of being worth every penny if you are a foodie or appreciate fine dining service."	2

We opted for the car service that Kai now offers and I am so glad we did. They picked us up in a very nice Infiniti SUV, gace us ice cold bottles of Voss water and dropped us off at the restaurant entrance. The car service is reasonably priced at $60 round-trip for up to 4 people. Highly recommend it! 

Now onto the dinner journey. We were welcomed by name when we walked in and invited to sit in the lounge for a few minutes. The lounge is lovely with a nice bar, cozy seats and beautiful fireplace. We were greeted by a server and given an amuse drink that was delicious. We ordered two cocktails before being escorted to our table. We had a corner table with windows and it was very romantic. 

Jackson was our server and he did a wonderful job. He explained the concept of a Kai and told us about the custom artwork that is on each menu. The menus are gorgeous! Since there were so many things that we both wanted to try, we opted for The Journey tasting menu, which consisted of the following:

Amuse
Ham & Potato Soup 
Hand Picked Lettuces From The Garden 
Foie Gras
Elixir 
Big Eye Tuna 
Festival of Seasons 
Escargot 
Intermezzo 
Grilled Tenderloin of Tribal Buffalo 
Global Artisan Cheese
Dessert

It was a lot of food and we loved every second of it. I got pictures of all the courses except the foie gras. I forgot that one, but it was amazing!

I read about Kai in Phoenix Magazine and made reservations for an anniversary dinner for my wife and I. 

It was a tour of exquisite dishes, prepared wonderfully, and coupling in Sonoran Desert ingredients and flavors that are completely novel in everyday cuisine. 

Jeremy was superb in leading the service staff. We were pampered and took occasional moments to enjoy the sunset over the mountains, followed by lightning periodically igniting the clouds as night took over.

It truly is impossible to describe just how wonderful their food is. The tastes are like nothing I have ever had before. It is hard to believe that food can be so special.  Service as always was impeccable. If you are looking for a special experience try Kai just once and you too will be hooked.	0
556	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	2	0	5	"If I were a Michelin judge, I would be awarding Kai and Chef  Ryan Swanson 3 stars (for you non Michelin aficionados, the BEST).  This is definitely a restaurant you should put on your destination list.  Meaning you should come for the food and the experience, no matter where you live.  I am saddened that Chandler, AZ is not on the Michelin guide list.

Kai is more than food, it is an experience.  It starts with your hostess, who memorizes your name whether it's a difficult Ghanaian or Greek name (kudos ladies, you pronounced them perfectly) and uses it several times while everyone is being seated.  Then your Maitre'd will continue the use of your properly pronounced name throughout your meal.  The staff, THE STAFF is a perfectly choreographed ballet.  They balance a formal service with personality and style.  The table service is some of the best I have ever had.

The FOOD, OMG THE FOOD.  We were fortunate enough to land a table for 4 for their Valentine's Day meal.  It was held the day before, because Kai is closed on Sundays.  The meal was a prix fixe which was a gamble for a couple of us.  Hubby has dietary restrictions as did one of our guests, she is EXTREMELY allergic to seafood.  I had mentioned these restrictions when making reservations and they were brought up immediately upon our seating and then re-referenced with each course, highlighting changes that were made to accommodate each guests plate.  They were on it!!!  Since the dinner was pre arranged, I feel sorry for all of you that will not get to experience the dishes we had last night.  They were so delectable and want to have them all over again.

We started with an Amuse, I can't remember what it was, but it came beautifully arranged on a small plate and was delicious, what a wonderful way to wake up our palates.  Our first course was ridiculous, foie gras and champagne, with almond milk froth, honey and mesquite brioche.  Next course was lobster and caviar ""risotto"", but instead of rice it was made with wheat berries (TO DIE FOR).  Then a sweetgrass and rosemary smoked squab breast, let me pause here.  The presentation for this dish was remarkable.  Imagine all 4 servers, plus the maitre'd coming out at the same time, surrounding the table carrying 4 beautiful large white bowls with tagine tops, they are placed at all 4 guests at the same time and the tagine lids, lifted at the same time.  Then suddenly this sexy rosemary smoke floats towards each guest and just fills your nostrils.  MY GOD, all our senses were going before we even took a bite into this course.  Just STUNNING.  We were then given an elixir in a shot glass to cleanse our palate once more.  The next course was a sage ash rubbed venison loin.  This course was so delicious, tender, melt in your mouth fabulousness.  I want to be able to order this over and over again.  Our final course was dessert, aptly named Roses are Red and Chef Swanson did a play on the rose from Beauty and The Beast.  It was delicious, but honestly I had no room left to do it justice.  I had a taste of everything and it was wonderful, but none of us could really finish our dessert.  Chef used molecular gastronomy throughout the meal and the dessert was his crowning jewel.  

I did not take pictures throughout this meal, this meal was about enjoying the experience, the food and our company.  I did not want to cloud it with an electronic device.  Just trust me and go enjoy this experience.  YES, the dining area is understated, isn't going to win a decorating award anywhere, but I believe this is purposeful so that your focus is on the food and not the decor.  The room is elegant, quiet and very comfortable.  I would love to eat in an environment like this more often.

Side note:  I had the pleasure of running into Chef Ryan Swanson earlier in the day and ladies he is a real cutie.  He is shy and has a smile that matches the beauty of his food.  So keep your eye on the kitchen door, you may catch a glimpse of him when he peeks out to view the room."	4
557	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	"I went to Kai last week and it was awesome (see previous review). After a week in Alaska and missing my family I decided to take my daughter to a special dinner. She doesn't meet the age requirement but she behaves better than most adults so I knew she would behave and that she would absolutely love it. She has a very sophisticated palette, especially for a kid. After the amuse bouche, which was pretty great, we received gluten free bread service. I'm always impressed when places have a lot of gluten free options or variations since I have to be gluten free, it's not a preference. We started with a squash soup which had cotton candy in it made from prickly pear, the cotton candy melts as they pour in the piping hot soup and adds a hint of sweetness. We both loved the soup. As a matter of fact my daughter was offered a smaller portion, she opted for the regular size, and ate the whole thing.  We were given a sorbet to cleanse our palettes and I must say, it in itself was a treat. Next we moved on to our entrees. She ordered elk which was served over risotto, I had the bison. Both were cooked to perfection and had amazing taste!  We finished the night sharing a dark chocolate soufflé. It was out of this world!  We were thrilled with our meal, the service was on point  and the atmosphere was great. They do a lot of little extra things to make the experience amazing. Just when we thought it couldn't get any better we picked up our car from valet. Waiting on the dash was a thank you card and a little thank you gift of muffins and honey in a cute little wooden box. We also each had a Voss water waiting for us for the drive home.  I highly recommend this place. Be prepared for a lengthy meal, they do things right, things are not rushed. 

Ad far as price, starters are $20-30 and entrees are in the $50 range. Wine prices vary, as expected.  We highly recommend Kai, it is a truly amazing experience."	2
558	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"I was completely blown away by the service and the food at Kai.  From the moment we walked through the door I felt as though we were getting the kind of personalized service that made us feel like we were the only diners in the restaurant.  We came in to celebrate our elopement which happened earlier in the week and could not have been more excited to start this experience!

First the decor is elegant but not over the top.  The view of the sunset over the mountains was breathtaking.  They opened the curtains at just the right time not to blind you while its setting but as soon as it passes over the mountains and the sky is illuminated with pinks and purples that only look real in paintings.

The staff always greets your by name and takes the time to take you though the history of the land and how it ties into the decor and the cuisine.  Each menu is adorned with a unique water color that represents the local tribe.

We ordered one appetizer, the lobster 3 ways.  It was magnificent.  Each uniquely delectable.  They then surprised us with 2 additional appetizers compliments of the house.  One was the escargot and the other was the rabbit and foie gras.  To say that we were overwhelmed with these delicious plates is an understatement.

We ordered 2 main courses, the buffalo and the elk.  I've never in my life tasted something so amazing.  The elk meat was tender and flavorful and accompanied with a delicious risotto.  They then shaved fresh black truffle over my plate.  I was in heaven.  My husband had the buffalo and again the flavors and tenderness of the meat were just amazing. It had crumbled chorizo as well as a small salad. 

The chocolate soufflé was decadent.  Although I was too full to continue, there was no way that I could pass this up.  It was everything and more.

As if the night couldn't get any better, upon getting into our car, we received a lovely hand written note form our server along with muffins and jam as well as a box of chocolates.  I wish I could give this review 10 stars because I walked out of there having the best culinary experience of my life.  

Hats off to the chef and staff and Kai.  You know how to make your patrons feel special."	0

I had the seven course tasting menu but didn't like the cheese very much. The rest of the courses were great but I would recommend trying the individual dish instead of the tasting menu.	1
560	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	This place is amazing! AMAZING!! On a whim, we called to make reservations for the last night of our honeymoon and were able to get an early, 530 pm seating. I asked for a later time and was a little put off by the way they said no. I started to cancel based on that interaction, but lucky for me and the rest of my food-loving-life, I didn't. The experience starts when you park. The valet greets you and asks for your name (for a later surprise, that I won't give away). We were seated in a beautiful room with windows that probably would've displayed a great sunset if we'd arrived earlier (don't cry for me, Argentina, we watched the sunset before we came ;) We were given the option of a flavor enhancer (lime, cucumber, orange, and maybe lemon slices; it was Dec 2013, so I don't remember) which was so tasty. Like they even paid attention to the flavor enhancers and didn't just chop them days ahead as a cast aside. I could write novels about my experience there, but I'll give you the highlights. We choose to make our own tasting menu since it was our go-big honeymoon meal. Best decision ever!!! We had the vegetable garden to start. Hubs still raves about how flavorful the baby carrot was, lol. We had a lobster trio dish, black squid ink pasta with seafood, two fish courses and maybe something else. It was the best meal of my life. So much attention to detail, focus on the experience for the customer, and an effort to connect with the culture from which the food came. We felt so special. It was a great end to our beautiful beginning (gag, sorry so sappy)	0
561	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	4	3	5	"Bar none, Kai is the best restaurant in Arizona, if not one of the best I have ever been. I've had the pleasure to dine here on three occasions, with the last somehow topping my first two unbelievable experiences. Though it will put a nice dent in your wallet, Kai is worth every penny. And then some. This past visit, I had the rare opportunity to try their 13 course dinner with wine pairings.

Kai expertly fuses together Native American and French Cuisines. It is not something you'd expect to work together, but with every dish unveiled, the food ceases to amaze. You'll tend to see the Native American influence with the meats and the ambiance, while the French component can be seen in the flavors and the service.  

Even within the first few minutes of dining, Kai manages to impress. Somehow, the greeter welcomed me with, ""Good evening Mr. Pachence"". I'm not sure how they knew my name before I even said a word. Once I was seated, the staff laid out the napkins in unison and provided the menus. As I've learned from my previous experiences, each menu has a unique hand-painted piece of art. The last two times, the waiter described the artwork along with the underlying story. I was only slightly disappointed that this wasn't enacted this time around, but it only makes sense since my dining excursion was already allotted for about three hours.

It's worth taking the time to call out the exquisite service. I had found out only a month before this past visit that Kai ranked #1 on OpenTable's 2012-2013 list of best service in the States. Had I not read that, I still would have put it at the top of the best service I've ever had from a restaurant. Their top-tier French service includes wait staff that fold your napkins when you leave for the bathroom. They reveal and take away the table's dishes all in unison. They absolutely cater to you, hand and foot. Everything is brought out at the perfect temperature, even the silverware! The forks are either chilled or heated, depending on the dish you receive.

Take for example, my second experience. I was with a group of four. At one point, the staff forgot to bring out a wine pairing with one of the dishes. They were the ones to point out later that a mistake was made, which they made up for by bringing a complimentary appetizer, paired wine, and a free dessert for the table at the end. Now that is service!

The meal itself was nothing less than a piece of art. The food was glittered with both style and substance. Out of the thirteen courses, it's pretty tough to choose the highlights, since everything was so very special. The miniature sous-vide vegetables (4th course), foie gras (5th course), escargot (9th course) and the buffalo tenderloin (11th course) stood out as the best. I've never been a fan of escargot, but the truffle crema and pork belly pieces made the dish so incredibly special that it may have permanently changed my mind on escargot. The buffalo was smokey and tender, with a sweet tinge that that came from the Saguaro blossom syrup.

Across all of the dishes, mushrooms seemed to be the theme of the night with five of the courses highlighted by various types. What is really impressive is that non of the mushroom types were reused throughout the dishes. I left the meal a little overstuffed, but undoubtedly happy. How could I not, after leaving what I would consider as one of top ten meals ever.

Kai is as good as it gets.

562	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	Coming from Chicago and the fine dining options we have in the city. KIA really impressed with their level of service from first arrival to valet having our car waiting for us with a gift of 2 water bottles ,a thank you for dining card,and 2 chocolates from the restaraunt waiting for us in the car. With those small added touches I can see why this place has some very high ratings. I didnt even get to the meal. The enjoyable part about dining here is it seems every plate comes with a historic Indian story behind it. Every plate we had was delicious and delivery timed well. The view of the mountians from our table was a plus also. I back their high marks.	3
563	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	"To me, giving a 5 star review means that a restaurant has reached the pinnacle of perfection, to which there is no doubt that Kai has attained.

This has become one of our families favorite places to go.  It is a true culinary experience.  We have been here three times and each visit had it's own highlights to make the visit memorable.  The ambience is impeccable; it isn't so much created by the decor but by the people serving you.  From the moment you arrive you are called by your name and treated like you are part of the family.  Every employee is attentive to make sure that you are comfortable and receiving the Kai experience.

Once you are seated you are treated to an explanation of the restaurant and it's vision.  They explain how everything from the menus (printed and placed in mesquite wood that was crafted from a member of the local tribe) to the food has been locally sourced.  You won't run out of options in terms of what your tastebuds may be tingling for as the menu provides a myriad of different options to satisfy your cravings.

Service is impeccable.  Upon our first visit we were actually a little startled when each of us had an attendant.  When your food is prepared they come out in one synchronous ballet to deliver your entrees at precisely the same moment.  

When you leave and get into your car, you are greeted with a thank you card from your server, bottles of Voss water and personalized chocolates from the restaurant.  They really have thought of everything.  If you want to experience the very best that Arizona has to offer look no further than Kai."	7
564	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"I heard some hubbub about this place being a five diamond restaurant and was curious so I decided to come check it out. Seriously, one of the best places I have ever been. 

My friends and I met here for dinner. Dinner was not only dinner. The restaurant made it a whole experience. At every point in our dinner, there was a narration and experience. Our menus had some local art, and our waiter explained its significant. Some points, there were olfactory experiences while other transition points yielding cold washcloths for freshening. The service was excellent and was a significant distinguishing feature. Our waiter and servers were very knowledgeable and engaging. They explained all our dishes and were able to answer any questions we had. Every person at our table had our food served at the same time. The food itself was excellent and interesting. I believe their food is culturally based, and they did serve many options that are usually served at traditional restaurants. My boyfriend's dish had edible dirt. They also served buffalo with a sauce that tasted literally like campfire. It was amazing. They do have a tasting menu, in the event you wish to try multiple options. Their cocktails were very tasty, and they do have beer and wine as well.

The cherry on top: our server took our valet slip. Upon leaving, they retrieved our car and when we got inside the car, we saw they had placed Voss glass bottles of water for every person in our car. They also placed some mini treats and a ""thank you"" card. I found this last part to be such a special experience. I mean, what restaurant does that?!

Amazing place. Amazing experience. It is pricey, but if or when you can spare the expense, I recommend trying this place."	1
565	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	Amazing food, service and ambiance! My husband and I came here for our anniversary and were very impressed. They think of every detail and even gave the valets anniversary cards, bottle water and chocolates on the way out. I highly recommend Kai for a special occasion!	0
566	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"We went to Kai to celebrate our anniversary this past Saturday and I am SO happy we got a reservation on their last night before they close for several weeks. 

First, I have to say that the staff is amazing. We elected to use the car service and our driver was fantastic. Once we arrived at the restaurant the hostesses greeted us by name and wished us a happy anniversary. The sommelier, Thomas, was personable and recommended great bottles of wine, both of which we thoroughly enjoyed. We had Quentin as our server and he was knowledgeable about the menu, the restaurant and its history. 

The food was 5 star! Although the menu changes, we enjoyed every course we were served. We started with the 4 cheese plate that was excellently accompanied by our wine selection. We then shared the lobster degustation and it was outstanding. We were then presented with an amuse bouche, bison tartar for my husband and a vegetarian choice for me that was delicious. Our entrees were the stars of the evening. I chose the Grouper with quinoa & the Mr. had the scallops. Both dishes were finished with amazing sauces done table side. Dessert was a piping out soufflé with vanilla bean cream and a complimentary chocolate mousse for our anniversary. 

I can't wait to go back once they reopen and introduce their new menu."	2
567	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	Wow, what a fantastic restaurant. Top notch professional service. Excellent tables. Food was absolutely incredible (we chose the Tasting Menu). It was a true dining experience with attentive, professional waiters, a relaxed atmosphere so that I could enjoy a wonderful meal with my wife. I can't say enough. Honestly. If you are in town and can afford the menu, the time, and the trip, you will not be dissatisfied. Please look at my other reviews. I don't give 5 stars to every restaurant. Kai deserves every accolade I can give it.	0
568	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	The food, drinks and ambiance were all great, but the service is what really set this restaurant above the rest. It was a wonderful experience.	0
569	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"Kai is a truly remarkable restaurant experience.  The food is beautiful;  uniquely and expertly prepared.  Service is exceptional, with a highly trained, professional staff.  It unquestionably deserves the Five Star Rating.

Significantly, however, the location bears severe consideration:  it's in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by big box chain stores, and way to far from the urban, city core.  I understand the ""Indian"" vibe that they are trying to create, but the Sheraton represents a contrived, inauthentic effort.  If the restaurant were located near our home, in the Biltmore area, we would be frequent diners there.  We stayed the night at the Sheraton for the sole purpose of avoiding the long drive home. It was fine, but the Sheraton simply does not measure up to the excellence of such a restaurant.  A restaurant of this caliber should be in hotels like The Four Seasons, Mandarin Oriental or Peninsula.  

Notwithstanding its ridiculous surroundings and the average, mediocre hotel in which it exits, the restaurant is so good that in spite of all that, it still receives Five Stars in our humble view."	1
570	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	Yelp didn't give me enough stars for Kai. One of the ten best restaurants in the country, maybe the world. After a perfect margarita, we went for the 13 course Journey menu, with wine pairing. Four hours later, we were beyond content. The food is full of unique Native American flavors, the setting is wonderful, and the service is beyond flawless. It's worthy of the most special occasions in your life.	1
571	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	"I wish I could give more than five stars. This place is transcendentally good. It is the complete package: food that defies description, service that is on the money and impeccable, and an experience that reminds you what food can mean to your mind and spirit.

My wife and I dined here tonight for our anniversary, and I saved up my Christmas money just to be able to go here. We have never spent this much money on one meal before, but we are both very into food exploration and wanted to do something really special since it has been awhile. We could not have been more correct in choosing this place.

While we waited for our table (we arrived a little early for our reservation), we were provided with a prickly pear fruit drink to start. It was amazing. We got our table exactly when we made our reservation, and we immediately noticed how intently the staff provided their service. Every course delivered to the surrounding tables was delivered individually by one server each in a line of four servers. It was almost like out of a movie. Our server greeted us by name (and continued to use our names throughout the meal), and greeted us in the local native language and welcomed us to Kai. 

I'll try to just hit the high points now so I don't end up writing more of a novel than I'm already onto. One of the sommeliers (yes, ONE of) offered us the wine selections. We went for the cheapest half-bottle they had, but it was still amazing. The menus are bedecked with individually custom-painted watercolors from a local artist. We made our selections, and all were brought to us perfectly timed, and they scraped the tablecloth clean between courses, which I've only seen once before and just feels super classy for some reason.

Between courses, there were small complimentary bites offered. First, before everything, was a single bite of oxtail with a corn salsa and a puree I don't recall with a microgreen sprig. Perfectly seasoned and a wonderful warmup. Then we had our first course. The waiters actually bring out a copper sauce pan to put the finishing sauce on the place right in front of you. I had a Hawai'ian Pomfret with a wild boar bacon sauce and some other things. Appallingly delicious. My wife had the barbacoa sheep with some incredible sauces and a fried egg. I don't remember the exact dish and the menu online isn't exactly the same one they had tonight in the restaurant. 

Next we got some bread, three different kinds, with a local olive oil and a mixture of crushed nuts. Again, all was preposterously good. The second course we split, which was the lobster three ways: butter braised with grilled avocado guacamole, heirloom cherry tomatoes, and osetra caviar, a lobster knuckle and endive salad with shaved fennel in a vanilla truffle vinaigrette, and a lobster bisque made with ancho and corn and topped with brown butter brioche crumbs. In the words of so many teenage girls: I literally can't even.

Next came a palette cleanser sorbet: raspberry and allspice with a cranberry drizzle. Finally came the main course. I hesitate to even try to explain this because I know language falls short of expressing the abject joy felt by your entire body while consuming perfection, but I will try. I ordered the elk loin wrapped in iberico ham and covered in a jus and truffle emulsion (which they drizzle on the meat before you) along with shaved black truffle (which they shave onto the place in front of you) along with a truffle and wild mushroom risotto. My wife ordered the seared duck breast. She also got a jus drizzle, but the duck was presented three ways: a whole piece, a piece sliced up, and a shredded piece with some other seasonings. She says the shredded duck was possibly the best thing she has ever eaten. The elk loin was gamey, as is to be expected, but the jus and truffle really cut through that and made a complete and rich taste of it all. The beets in the risotto were a bit vegetal for me, but that's just preference.

I could try to put the experience into words, but everything I've typed so far just scratches the surface and is far too many words as it is. Quite simply, if you have the money for a special occasion meal and you love food that is life-long memory making, go here. This is the best meal I have ever had in my life. I embarrassed my wife by doing so, but I asked to see the chef (the chef was actually gone, but the sous chef came out) so I could shake his hand and thank him in person for the incredible experience he provided for me and my wife. 

I have been to a number of amazing restaurants, but few restaurants you will be able to find anywhere in this country will be able to offer such a unique and complete experience. The incorporation of local and native ingredients and styles connects you to the land and history while the creative and beautiful techniques and presentations makes for more than just a delicious meal. It truly is an experience you cannot get anywhere else and that you should not miss."	1
572	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	"Five star all the way! Waiter was knowledgeable, friendly, and listended.  Everything about the restaurant was spectacular.  The atmosphere, the elegance, the first class service.  The waiter and staff only called me by my name for introduction purposes.  I did not feel like it was overbearing at all as I read in some negative reviews.

The food, athough some of the pairings sound odd, went together really well.  I loved the foie gras and the escargot (prepared in a manner never before seen).  

The buffalo, amazing.  I actually liked it with the red wine reduction from the ribeye with the buffalo.  I asked for pepper to spice it up a bit and was brought three varieties of pepper.  They were amazing!  

Certainly a special occasion location, but so worth it and it deserves all of the positive accolades."	0

576	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	11	6	5	"Aside from a one-time visit to Binkley's in Cave Creek last year, my girlfriend and I really don't have much experience with fine-dining. After seeing Kai constantly popping up on Phoenix' ""Best Of"" lists, I wanted to see what all of the fuss was about. We made a reservation for the weekend of my 34th birthday, which we booked pretty far in advance.

We were definitely not disappointed. The quality (and taste) of the food, the attention to detail, and courteousness of the servers are all top notch. We were referred to by our names by the staff, well accommodated with specific requests, and felt as comfortable as you can be in an environment that can be somewhat intimidating if you're unfamiliar with it.

Both my girlfriend and I debated on whether to order the 7-course Short Story or 13-course Journey from the tasting menu. Ultimately, we decided on the Short Story, which despite the name, ended up being more than enough food to satisfy us.

Their menus feature beautiful Native American paintings, each having a distinct back-story that was described in great detail by our server. Every dish had a story, including some of the tiniest details on the plates that we'd probably overlook if we weren't paying attention.

We received a wide variety of different breads to try, along with local olive oil. All were incredibly unique and incredibly delicious. After devouring the original three, they brought out three different ones for us to try. We received a potato puree soup, which was absolutely phenomenal (and I don't even like soup!).  

Since I expressed to our server that I don't like seafood, my Three Sisters (scallops) was swapped out with a foie gras. Initially, I was hesitant, as once again, I don't really like liver - but I guess that's because I've never had good liver, because this was superb! Even my girlfriend's scallops, which I'd normally not even go near, were actually done very well. I guess if there's one thing that I learned after dining here, it's that you don't necessarily know what you like and dislike until you've actually tasted things done exceptionally well.

The cold sorbet we received as a palette cleanser actually startled me by the amount of purely natural flavor it contained.

The tribal buffalo we received as a main entree (cooked medium well - don't judge!), was some of the best meat I've ever had, with the chorizo adding in a spice that adds mild heat, but not to the point where it's offensive. The global artisan tray contained a wonderful cheddar-like cheese from England and a brutally potent blue cheese that lingered on our palettes long after we finished.

For dessert, we received sweet potato cake that included a tamarind sorbet, which was extremely good. When we return, however, I'd love to try their fry bread and tribute to chocolate full-plate desserts, as it looks like they have many exciting options that I'd expect great things from.

After picking up my car with the valet, we found a hand-written card, two bottles of water, and some chocolates. They couldn't have done it any better!

In summary, Kai is an experience that you must try - if only once. The food, the service, the atmosphere, and the whole experience definitely puts it at the top of my list as one of the best dining experiences we've ever had.

Note: After returning a couple of years later for another birthday celebration, I see no need to update this review. Everything was as consistently great as it was during our first trip.

Recommended to the highest extent possible!"	15
577	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	2	5	"The night started off with a bet. The partner and I were celebrating our first year anniversary and there wasn't a better place to celebrate than Kai. After having an excellent adult beverage at the bar we found out our server from the last visit was working and requested him. I bet the tab that if my partner called Kevin, K-Money or K-Dawg, I'd be happy to pay.  Well he did and Kevin ran with it.  He's the kind of server that even if we asked for him to rap for us he'd do it. He laughed at my jokes about the super bowl half time show and showed genuine interest when we discussed Indigenous creation stories.
We had initially decided to forgo the birth and order everything off the beginning then our entrees, but Kevin and our bartender swore by the deliciousness of the soup. 
Any fine diner in the valley can attest the super popularity of truffle and how over used the product can be. It's become almost like the useless parsley on your Denny's breakfast platter, with the exception that it over powers the many crudos and veggies it's meant to compliment. It's become so overwhelming that anytime I see it on the menu, no matter how appetizing the food may sound, I opt for something else.  However, Kai does it right. The truffles balanced the lamb, potato and broth with an earthy sweetness that made it over the top.  Just smelling the soup put a smile to my face.
The escargot was just as wonderful.  The entire beginning was awesome, though this time we did not order the lobster.
Just before our entree service we got some bad news so I can't comment much on the main course.  What I can comment on, is that K-Money was awesome about us having to cut out early. He boxed our entrees without us having to ask and sent us home with a complementary dessert and truffles. The sweet potato cake was sweet, moist and the accoutrements went well with the cake. Kevin listened well to our needs, knowing I was not a chocolate person and partner was. He found the balance we needed to share a dessert. 
To top it all off, we found a card waiting in the car when we got it back from the valet. The usual chocolate bar and water bottles were there, but the card was signed K-Money.  It was small touch, but it showed how much they valued us as customers. 
And while many may look at other restaurants because the price tag is intimidating, for the service and food, Kai is worth much more. With a bottle of Dom, four cocktails, and all our food, the bill was still under 500.00. It's a must have for any special occasion."	6

583	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	2	0	5	"Kai, meaning seed in a Native American language, is a top tier fine dining restaurant. It resides inside, get this, a Sheraton. The entire dining experience feels like sitting down at a cozy fireplace for an epic retelling of some story, similar to the recent Clash of Clans advertisement with James Corden and lava pups.

The waiter had all of us hold our menus with the fronts facing the center of the table. The fronts of the menus each had different water color art, and each visual told a different story. At one point I exclaimed, ""Well, I had a bean burrito for lunch,"" which caused everyone, including the waiter, to giggle a bit. The whole thing was a bit over the top for my taste, but I can tell why they do it.

I had the Short Story tasting menu, which I can tell you, is not short at all. The entire meal was about 2.5 hours for the seven courses. My group had an uni (sea urchin) allergy, Portobello mushroom allergy, and of course, I'm vegetarian. The restaurant had no problem adjusting the tasting menu.

The ""Hand Picked Lettuces"" (tomato eggplant salad) was remarkably well presented - the greens looked as if they were sprouting from the tomato eggplant base. The ""From The Garden"" (beets, asparagus, etc.) was quite the mix of interesting colors. I felt like I was eating art.

My favorite dish was the main course. Meant to be a buffalo entrée, the chef took out the buffalo and made a convincing equivalent with quinoa. I was a bit concerned when I first heard his plan. I once did the tasting menu at Bluestem in Kansas City where they just replaced the meat with grilled vegetables for a vegetarian friend, and we were both disappointed. But Kai did no such thing. 

Be wary of eating too much bread here. The course portions were enough to make me full, but Kai had nearly ten kinds of bread available for tasting that night. I guess there is such a thing as too much good food.

At one point our group took a picture next to a memory catcher, or dream weaver, or some kind of Native American art that the waiter explained was only one of three in the world, with one of the others being in a museum. He noted that a woman previously had snagged her bag on it, causing it to collapse and have to be remade. Naturally, a person in our group had his sweater snagged onto it while taking the photo. Listen, it's not just dreams and memories that this thing was designed to grab a hold of.

The service at Kai was other-worldly. The presentation was fantastic - it's not every day I have a meal where six waiters with a plate each come out at the same time. I guess it's standard for the price. But Kai is the kind of restaurant that has the valet leave bottled water, chocolate, and a hand written thank you card in your vehicle. AND I DIDN'T HAVE CASH FOR A TIP. Probably my most embarrassing moment of 2016 YTD.

If I'm in the Phoenix area and have the time and money to come back, I will. Kai is so out of the way, but if you're looking for a food journey (or short story) in Arizona, Kai is the right place."	3
584	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	This was an amazing experience. From the most incredible food pairings with multiple flavors with a dish, to staff that was absolutely on top of every detail. I have had the opportunity to eat in some of the finest restaurants both in the States and abroad, I would say this now rates as my best experience.	0
585	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	Simply Amazing! The service and food are one of a kind! The use of fresh local ingredients are spectacular! Make reservations right before the sunset restaurant has an amazing view! I have visited many top notch restaurants with amazing chefs but none compare to Kai! The lobster dish was to die for just the right amount of butter.  Mushrooms with goat cheese and escargot simply amazing! Words won't do the food any justice! Just go and enjoy you Will NOT be disappointed!	0
586	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	1	0	5	"WOW!  It is very hard to impress me but this restaurant went above and beyond.  The service was flawless, decor Native American appropriate and food outstanding!  We were staying at the Sheraton Wild Horse Pass on business and I went to Yelp to see where we should eat.  Lo and behold, Kai, a AAA Five Diamond, Forbes Five Star restaurant pops up and it's in our hotel.  

We arrive and the formalities start using our last names.  While I usually find it annoying, here it wasn't.  The waiter comes over who knows every item on the menu, many of which had ingredients for which we required more details.   All three of us were laughing as the menu was so spectacular we wanted to order it all.  All ingredients are locally sourced and most Native American unique. I would describe what I had but wouldn't do it justice.   The cuisine  is French that meets Native American.  I ate a fish dish and the others had meat. If my wife was with me, who is a vegetarian, she would have loved it equally as well. 

Also nice is that they had a great craft cocktail menu, a great selection of scotch, and knew how to mix a Perfect Martini.  Other unexpected surprises included small chef prepared dishes between meals, a free craft cocktail from the waiter, and when I returned to my room, a small linen ""Koi"" bag was hanging on my door with three mini muffins and homemade preserves, which were delicious.  

If you are looking for a restaurant and this is nearby, or even a bit of a drive, definitely enjoy it.  It will be one of the better experiences of your life! 

Price: 3 people, appetizer and entree each, probably 3 top shelf drinks each, $300. $360 after tip. Well worth it."	3

588	AkpuhGyLAxhD_sLMQv3kOg	0	0	5	I had a lovely dinner here.  I had two friendly and attentive servers.  Make a reservation in advance and mind the dress code.  I had the from the garden, buffalo tenderloin and the essence of chocolate dessert.  The desert was my least favorite it was ok.  Everything else was great.  I enjoyed the bread and the amuse bouche (seared elk loin) and the sorbet intermezzo.  I had a couple vermouths and the bill with tip came to $130.  the steak and salad were both excellent.  The bill came with truffles and upon paying valet had already retrieved my vehicle and there were more chocolates, bottle of water, and a thank you note inside.	1

The service is out of this world impressive! I have been to many fine dining restaurants throughout the country, however I have to  express this one was by far extraordinary and it surpassed them all! The presentation, the aroma, the savoriness of the food is majestic and simply remarkable! From the minute you step into the bar area it is luxurious and you are treated like royalty, all the way to the time you are back to your car at the valet.  
I absolutely appreciated and loved the courtesy as well as the respectfulness of the staff.
I absolutely recommend Kai restaurant to anyone who is looking for an outstanding restaurant."	0

My husband has worked in the food and restaurant industry for over 20 years and now compares everything to Kai - which is completely unfair! We have had the short story, as well as various other menu items. Everything is fabulous - presentation, flavor, the attention to detail...
Menus are designed by native artists, the table decor, the interior, etc. - all inspired by and/or done by Natives of various tribes. 
The service is impeccable - all employees are very knowledgeable & attentive. And the finishing touches (bottled water, a hand-signed note from our attendant & chocolates in the car that was pulled up from valet) was so personal. Kai amplified our anniversary celebrations! We hope to be able to visit again!"	1
591	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	5	2	5	"We have always enjoyed Kevin Binkley's places, but this was our first time at his newly reformatted Binkley's in the previous Bink's Mid-town location. Kevin decided to scale back and focus on his passion, which is cooking, rather than multi-unit restaurant management.

The format of the new Binkley's is extremely personal with lots of interaction. The dining experience is played out in three distinct acts. The first act is on the front patio and involves a series of tastes (passed by Chef Binkley and others) along with beverages (more on this later). This where everyone gathers at the appointed dining time. There's a fireplace and a small kitchen garden. The second act is in the ""parlor"", including the bar and some adjacent tables. Plates get a little larger and beverages continue to flow. As each plate comes out, it is accompanied by an explanation of what it is and, often, the story behind it. The third act is in the ""dining room"" where the tables are oriented toward the open kitchen. By open kitchen, I mean completely open. Guest are invite to come in and watch or ask questions. The later courses and dessert happen in this act.

An endearing trait of Chef Binkley is his complete fascination with food combined with a desire to share the knowledge and experience with others. At the new Binkley's, guest come away with a superb meal and great service, but also they leave with some new thinking about food. He definitely spends as much time as he can talking about the food without shortchanging the actual production and serving of the food.

The food is delicious, interesting and carefully crafted. It consists of 22 courses set in advance (no choices, but you can tell them in advance of any allergies). In our case, this included: foie gras slider, tuna tartare, brown butter baby radishes, bacon donuts, trio of aged hams, date soup, chilled poached scallops, white truffle risotto, tangerine soda, slow cooked whey-fed pork shoulder, freezing mango soup, caramel apple and much more. All showed creativity and clever presentation. One of the simplest courses from a guest point of view is apparently one of the hardest from a restaurant point of view: a fresh brioche. They were brought to the table fresh from the oven and were absolutely outstanding. After sitting just 5 minutes, they were just good. That's just one example of the learning experience combined with the actual eating.

The restaurant only seats 24 people per seating (1 on Thursday and Sunday and 2 on Friday and Saturday, I think). It is fixed price and it is a ticket paid for in advance (we paid $160 per person plus 22% gratuity). If you don't show or are late, things continue without you.

Beverages may be purchased ala carte or as a pairing. We chose the pairing and this included a cocktail plus six or seven glasses of wine. The pairing is also purchased with the dining ticket.

It is one of the more unique dining options in the Valley and for anyone who has an interest in food: one not to be missed!"	7
592	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	5	3	5	"If there is any source of frustration or angst that Kevin Binkley inspires, its a difficulty in conveying to others the experience of taking in his culinary wonders.  The ingredients are often hard to find & the presentation is unlike anything you've seen anywhere.  So finding adjectives to fully convey the expertise, the creativity, & the magic of Binkley's is a very tall task (one that I won't come close to conveying myself).  And perhaps that's the biggest part of Kevin Binkley's genius.  The ability to leave his customers wondering from the moment they're served their meals to the unending curiosity that follows well after the meal has been consumed.  I've been to Binkley's in Cave Creek many times over the course of my lifetime, but tonight was my first try at his newly revamped operation on 23rd Street & Osborn.  Kevin sold off all of his other operations to gamble everything on a single location in central Phoenix where he & his wife Amy deliver a truly personalized dining experience that can last upwards of 5 hours.  As an early Mother's Day present, I brought my Mom along to try out Kevin's new spot & see if the new location could match the experience of his old flagship in Cave Creek.

If you've been to Binkley's old location in Cave Creek in the past, you'll likely remember it as a quaint but spectacular restaurant serving a wide array of foods presented in new & innovative ways that few have ever heard of.  At Binkley's new location in central Phoenix, Kevin is taking that formula to new heights with a restaurant that feels more like a home where you the customer are given the red carpet treatment as the guest.  Instead of sitting in one place for the duration of the evening, you're instead migrating from the front porch, to the inside bar area, & finally to the main dining room where you are served course after course of delicious innovative food at every step of the evening.  All totaled its a 22 course experience.  While that may sound overwhelming, the food is served in small portions that allow your palette to experience the unending sensory explosion & your stomach to slowly absorb the awesomeness coming its way.  And trust me, the food is so good you'll want to keep eating until you pop.

Much like Binkley's old location, the menu changes regularly (every week at the new location in fact) so I won't bother going over everything that was served tonight as it will likely be a totally different experience for those that choose to venture here after my Mom & I did.  But I'll give you some of the more consistent points.  First off, they take reservations up to 30 days in advance (& I wouldn't wait long after that window opens).  Secondly, you pay as part of making your reservation, which means there's no need to worry about leaving a tip or even busting out your credit card on the night you dine in as its all figured in well in advance.  The other area of consistency at Binkley's?  The service.  The staff at the new Binkley's is just as friendly, just as accommodating, & just as flexible as their old location (even moreso in some respects) & will fall all over themselves if it means making your dining experience a perfect one.  That service goes all the way up the ladder to Chef Binkley himself, who will interact with you at your table on a regular basis & invites you into their open kitchen to see how items are made, what ingredients are used & witness the sous chefs work with in harmony with Kevin such that it almost looks like a perfected dance recital.

Alright, let's get to the elephant in the room.  While Binkley's is hands down the best restaurant I've ever been to in Arizona, it does come with a cost.  Assuming you go with the absolute barebones setup (which is amazing in of itself), you're going to be paying somewhere in the range of $200/person.  If you did what I did & upgrade some of the meal options (I added a wine pairing as well as a Japanese Wagyu Kobe Beef upgrade) you can pay hundreds more per person.  I will say the Wagyu beef upgrade was completely worth it as the meat had an almost etherial flavor to it.  I will also say the wine pairing was also a good value, though I'll admit I still have a pretty good buzz going on as there was about 12 wine pairings for the evening (& they topped off my empty glasses for free).  If you're going to do the wine pairing option, my advice would be to take an Uber or Lyft to and from Binkley's as you'll likely be super tipsy by night's end.

For financial reasons this might well be my one & only trip to the new Binkley's in the foreseeable future.  And for some, the expense of a place like Binkley's might well be a mountain too tall to climb.  I sincerely hope Kevin Binkley finds innovative ways to make his culinary talents more accessible to the masses going forward.  But if you've got the money to splurge & a 5 hour evening window available, put this place on your foodie bucket list.  Kevin Binkley truly is a valley culinary wonder"	6
593	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	1	0	5	"I don't think I can fully express how amazing my experience was at this restaurant this year for Valentines Day. I have no doubt that Chef Binkley  will finally receive his James Beard Award. He was absolutely spectacular in his innovative courses, you can really feel his passion in all of his food. He personally described some of his dishes to us and I was in such awe because he reminded me why I went to culinary school. You can tell he is doing what he loves .

I really loved how the dinning experience was very interactive, we changed settings three different times. We started on the patio with another couple for drinks and a couple of courses, then we moved indoors and sat at the bar for some more courses, then finished up at our own table facing the kitchen for the remainder of the dinner. I really loved how we felt like we were guests in his home. 

I was kind of a creeper because I literally watched their every move. Chef Binkley and his staff moved so flawlessly like a choreographed dance.  I will absolutely be back to celebrate a special event in the future."	1
594	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	Chef Binkley has developed an experience and menu which is better than some of the 3 Michelin starred places I've been, and is significantly less stuffy and more approachable.  The menu changes based on seasonal ingredients, thus is different week to week and month to month.  Highly recommended.	1
595	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	"The new Binkley's is easily the best restaurant experience to be had in the Valley, hands down, and rivals any experience to be had anywhere.  If this restaurant doesn't earn Chef Binkley his overdue James Beard award, it's time to retire the organization as frauds and dunces.

My wife and I ate there last night for our anniversary.  The first 10 or so appetizer courses were served in the ""bar"" where you are seated with other couples (under normal circumstances, the first few would have been served on the patio, but it was 115 outside); our table was actually a lot of fun as we each tried to wrap our heads around the breadth of ingredients gathered from the four corners of the Earth.  We were then escorted to individual tables for the rest of the meal.  

Over the course of 4 hours, we were treated to a mind-boggling 27 courses, each meticulously planned and executed by the expert staff.  

How do I know they're experts?  Because you are free to roam the entire restaurant as if you were a guest in the chef's house, and after talking to most of the staff over the course of the evening, it's evident that everyone there has a serious passion for their work.

I won't go into the individual dishes because odds are they'll be different if you go and it would probably take me just this side of forever to describe accurately and convey how good they were.  Suffice it to say that as impossible as it may seem, at $200 each ($160 plus an automatic 22% gratuity before wine), Binkley's may just be the best bargain in the Valley as well.  Dishes such as these around $7 each is absolutely ludicrous.  

Obviously this is not the kind of place you eat twice a week, but if you can possibly manage it, you owe it to yourself to eat at Binkley's at least once; if for no other reason than to understand what is possible when world class ingredients meets world class talent."	2
596	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	4	Amazing!  Expensive! A fun treat for all!  Go hungry and make sure to relax and enjoy. You must have a lot of time and money for tasting the 28 courses and 14 paired wines. I would have been happier with 14 and 7!  Way too much all the way around for me!	0
597	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	"An honored dining experience with amazing food and great service! 

It's a three hour dining experience. They turned a house into a restaurant. That makes us feeling like dining at home, however with experts cooking for us. :) 

The dining places change depends on the food. We started at the patio right beside the fireplace with champagne and appetizers. Then moved to the bar area, and afterwards to the living room for main courses. I couldn't remember all the dishes' names, because there are so many! All the ingredients are fresh and upscale, with the chef explaining what is in each dish, how he made it, and why he made it(sometimes). 

Great service. We went for our engagement celebration. I was surprised they had two congrats cards on the table when we sat down at the living room for main courses. And it seems like most of the staff knew why we were there celebrating. 

They gave two blood oranges and two menu lists when we left. And they sent us out to the door! 

Again, it was an honored dining experience with amazing food and great service! Feel like they operate like a Michelin restaurant."	1
598	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	1	0	5	Had the most amazing dinning experience tonight. Took my wife for her birthday and we weren't disappointed.  Every person on the staff was kind and respectful. They all made you feel as if you were coming to their home and wanted nothing more than for you to be happy and welcome. Chef Binkley was so wonderful and warm. He makes you feel as if you're family while he makes you the greatest food you'll ever have. Each course was better than the next. We both thank you all for making our night special and making us feel like we were more than welcome. See you soon.	1
599	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	3	4	5	"As long time fans of Binkley's in Cave Creek, Kevin Binkley has nailed the part of that experience that I longed for more of.  He's taken the joy of eating his incredible creations and paired that with a ""dinner party"" setting where each part of the evening takes place in a different area of the house.  

On several jaunts to Cave Creek, we sat at the bar mostly to be able to watch him work through the pass window.  We also had a few chats with him this way and that was always one of the most special parts of those evenings.  The ""new"" Binkley's capitalizes on this as guests have unfettered access to him, the kitchen and pretty much anywhere in the house.  Guests are invited to wander through the kitchen, ask questions and and geek out to their hearts' desires.  

Our meal was pure Binkley's perfection.  Each course was presented beautifully and although everything was not necessarily to my tastes, I recognize the thought, precision and love that went into every bite.  

Even more impressive was the accommodation of our hard-to-feed group with one pescatarian, one dairy-free person and one gluten-nut-nightshade-free person.  He did an absolutely beautiful job bringing out similar versions that jibbed with our nutritional issues.  He mentioned how he hated when someone had an allergy or a preference, that person's dish was often radically different than what others received.  Not so here - not only do they accomodate any and everything, they seem to welcome the challenge. 

There was a moment in the evening when I was nearly brought to tears by being able to witness Binkley's passion, dedication and creativity to his art.  He makes every guest feel like a longtime friend and his enthusiasm for ingredients and cooking is contagious.  

One possible recommendation: it's a LOT of food and although I'm not a big wine person, I opted to do the sommelier pairing (which was fantastic and totally worth it).  However, unless you're a professional competitive eater, you may want to consider splitting the wine pairing with a friend.  Several glasses went unfinished and I felt terrible about this given that there are sober people in the world...  

I cannot wait to come back."	6
600	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	1	0	5	I honestly cannot say enough good things about the Chef and his restaurant. His bites are creative and exciting as well as delicious. His location is easy to get to and gorgeous inside and out. I am a super fan and will be coming back as often as I can. Thank you Chef Binkley!	2
601	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	1	0	5	Celebrated my birthday at Binkley's in their new midtown restaurant location and with a brand new dining concept.  A 22-course meal is one that is tailored for those who appreciate choice ingredients, a passion for exquisite food, and the craft of presentation.  The dinner began with a communal sitting at the bar to enjoy the starter courses (it would have been the outside patio, but the weather did not cooperate that evening).  We then proceed to the dining room where we were seated at individual tables for each party.  Chef Binkey introduced us to his open kitchen concept, and told us to feel free to walk about the kitchen to watch and chat with the chefs as they carefully assembled each course.  The dining experience is a much more personable experience compare to his previous restaurants, and Chef Binkley was not hesitant to share information about his dishes, the ingredients used and their sourcing, and various cooking insights.  The intent was to make one feel like a special and close guest in their private home rather than a customer in their restaurant, and that intimacy was achieved.  It was indeed a special dining experience, just the perfect splurge for that special occasion, or to be enjoyed at any time if finances permit.	1
602	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	1	0	5	Absolutely remarkable culinary experience! Chef Binkley is a masterful artist. We felt like we were guests in his home as he personally waited on our every need. We enjoyed 22 courses each with its own unique story. Wine was paired with perfection throughout the experience. An incredible journey from the patio to the bar to main dining room, each having its own delectable surprises. The ambience is a considerable upgrade from the Cave Creek restaurant. It was cozy, quaint, and warm. We loved every aspect and cannot wait till next time.	2
603	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	We were recently here, and loved it. Excellent service, and the food was outstanding. We bounce back and forth between LA, SF and Scottsdale, so we have a good yardstick for quality..	0
604	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	Easily one of my top 5 meals in my lifetime. After a hastily planned trip to Scottsdale we got a recommendation for Binkley's. With no pretense we showed up for dinner and later learned about the 24 courses. Everyone kept me wanting more and when the fresh baked bread came out I know I had to hold back. It is work a trip to Phoenix just to eat here. Also, the chef recomended several restaurants in the area that we tried and of course loved. Taco Chiwa and Nobuo.	0
605	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	2	1	5	"First of all, this is the new flagship restaurant for Chef Binkley.  Tasting menu only, reservations required.  

Let me state that I have eaten in fine dining restaurants all over the world, and have owned and operated a fine dining restaurant.  Chef Binkley has scored a home-run with this restaurant - without question.  It is one of the most creative, flavorful meals that I have had in a long time.  My hearty congratulations to the chef for having developed and executed a fantastic experience...and it's an experience, not just a meal.

Our evening was 24 courses.  We moved about the restaurant to three separate dining environments - patio, bar, and open kitchen dining area.  Service was flawless and each course a build to a very interesting conclusion.  It was a long evening, perhaps approaching 5 hours, but the time passed quickly and there was never a wait for the next course.  Wine pairings were great (three levels offered).  Can't miss with whatever level you choose, although I would suggest the middle (sommelier level), or the top end (chef level).  Outstanding selections.

This is not an inexpensive evening.  Reservations are $160 each with wine pairings of $85, $130 and $190, but IMHO well worth the experience.

My hope is that Phoenix can support this level of creativity and excellence in dining.  It is definitely worth it.

I'll attach a copy of the menu - small print so hard to read but you can zoom in hopefully to see the detail of each course.

Congrats to Chef Binkley and his wife Amy for an outstanding addition to the Phoenix restaurant scene."	6
606	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	Absolutely amazing dinner and experience. Not one item disappointed and while the food changes week to week so there is no point to mention specific dishes, rest assured you will not be disappointed. The presentation, flavors and service were a 10 out of 10!	1
607	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	The best food, best chef, best service period.  I have traveled the seven seas and have never experienced anything quite like this.  Plus best value in the valley.  If you love food you will love Binkley's.	0
608	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	1	0	5	Really Arizonas only chance at a Michelin Star right now. The nicest owner, food is incredible. Think of this as an interactive experience. Worth every penny. Cmon Kevin! Bring home a star for AZ.	2
609	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	3	0	5	"My girlfriend and I had the pleasure of dining at Binkley's on Cave Creek for my birthday a couple of years ago. In fact, I still have a copy of our menu. It was what I consider to be our first introduction to fine-dining.

So when I heard that chef Kevin Binkley was closing shop and converting his Midtown location to explore an entirely fresh concept, I couldn't help showing some genuine intrigue. 21-courses for 160 dollars, you say? When I told colleagues of our plans, they looked at me oddly. But what people might not understand is that, if you ordered a six-course meal at Binkley's old restaurant, you were probably getting the equivalent amount of food that you'd receive here. 

So, what makes this different than the old location in Cave Creek? In short, it's an experience, or some might say, a ""journey"" of sorts. The dinner is split into three acts, which starts on the patio, moves into the bar-area, while culminating in an open-kitchen dining room where guests are actually encouraged to go into the kitchen and observe what Binkley and his staff are preparing. There are no secrets here - even though I'm convinced his desserts are laced with some potent problem-solving painkiller drug.

In short, it's a fine-dining experience unlike anything else we've ever found and without a doubt, one of the best we've tried in our ongoing search for great food in Phoenix.

It's difficult to stick to the traditional approach of writing a review of this particular restaurant. For example, I can't sit here and provide an opinion of each plate, nor can I really provide any recommendations of what to order. As I tell the children I work with: You get what you get - and you don't throw a fit, even though we feared that one lady was on the verge of doing so during the early stages. And I'm confident to say that, what you do get, might just be some of the best food you've ever had the pleasure of tasting.

All food (and drinks) are brought out with elaborate descriptions being provided. Everything has a backstory, a purpose, and a source (often local) that is executed with high-style and precision. While servers were all excellent, I particularly enjoyed listening to Kevin talk about each dish in great detail. The guy's passion for food goes far beyond simply running a business for profit. By the end of the night, you can't help but truly admire both he and his wife for what it is that they're trying to accomplish. I'd classify the food as primarily farm-to-table - and I must say, he's doing a damn-fine job of delivering the goods!

Once again, I can't really make recommendations. If we were to return, I'm certain that the adventure would be entirely different than what we had this last Saturday. Aside from their ultra-cool ciphoned tea, which is a tradition carried over from the old restaurant, everything else was entirely new, fresh, and for lack of a better word: Fun!

Overall, the entire experience lasted a whopping four hours. Your bill is prepaid when you make your reservation (including gratuity). Upon exiting, you're given a gift bag, which includes a copy of the menu which will definitely help with our Yelp picture captions.

The question remains: Is it the best dining experience in all of Phoenix?

Honestly, that really depends on what it is you're looking for. While I can't really say for certain, I can confidently admit that it's definitely a dining experience that we'll never forget.

Excellent service, phenomenal food, and an intimate setting that is unlike anything else you'll find. Binkley's is a place that I feel that everyone should try at least once. And for that, I find it very hard to give the entire experience anything less than a full five stars.

Well done!"	6

Because this is not just a dinner at a restaurant. It's an experience. You really feel at home here, and the three setting theme is amazing! It really gives you a full experience. You're welcome at any point to go inside, and as Kevin Binkley said, there are no closed doors. I went into the kitchen and the fridge and Chef Binkley told me about how they change out their produce every few days and source locally from the farmers market. The price is high but it's well worth it. You can be as intimate with the kitchen as you want-you can plate the dishes or wander into the walk in refrigerator or walk into any room, or just sit back, relax and enjoy a spectacular dinner. A beautiful and warm interior, the service is spectacular and the food is an experience. From the moment you are warmly welcomed to when you're being walked to the door by Kevin Binkley himself, you're in for a great time."	2

The dishes were varied, all were delicious, and all were a delightful pairing of tastes.  The wines were also extraordinary.

Chef Binkley served many of the dishes himself and described what we were eating. He welcomed us to explore the kitchen whenever we desired.  It was as if we were all eating at him own home.

The dinner was not cheap but I knew what to expect because pricing was explained in advance.  I had also eaten at their Cave Creek location when IT was the more formal dining location (now Osborn is).

If you enjoy fine dining, you will not be disappointed."	2

We like to call it the science dinner experience, a lot of the food changes when you put it in your mouth or you have to do something to the food before you eat it, very engaging.

615	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	1	0	5	We came here for our anniversary and it was absolutely amazing. There were many courses and every single one was incredible. The relaxed ambiance is set as if you are having dinner in the chef's home and it delivers that feel perfectly. We were welcomed to step into the kitchen and see the dishes be prepared and had the chef deliver many of our dishes to our table and that experience alone guarantees that we will return. Chef Binkley astonished me with his humble approach to us and the other customers. We recieved a personal note on our table in honor of our anniversary as well as a gift bag with personal touches. To top it all off, Chef Binkley called us  a few days later to thank us again for celebrating at his restaurant. I cannot express my gratitude to Chef Binkley enough as I was blown away by this detail. We will be back indefinitely and I sincerely hope you give Binkley's a try to experience the magic that he serves up.	0

It was hands-down the best dining experience I have ever had. It was absolutely beautiful, delicious in every way, and will always be a treasured memory of mine. 

This place is not just a dinner out, it's truly an experience. My husband and I went for our Anniversary and I felt like we were transported to another place - the realities of life and kids, and home were set aside for that brief evening. It was all about that moment and the beauty of the food. 

I think most of us don't appreciate the effort involved to produce our food (myself included much of the time). We purchase it from the store, throw something together and mindlessly eat it. We never see where the food comes from, the effort by the farmer to grow it, to nurture it...food has lost it's deep value because it comes so easy to us. Our family grows some of our food in an attempt to have an awareness of this process - but even then it's hard to be mindful. But on this night, I appreciated every single thing that went into my mouth. 

The respect for each ingredient was evident in the plating, in the preparation, and in the eyes of Chef Binkley as he came out and talked about his inspiration for each dish. There were 21 amazing things to try, all totally different and unique. It was always the best when the chef was personally able to come and explain each dish (most of the staff did a good job when it wasn't the chef, but the passion wasn't the same for them). That would be one suggestion - that the staff work on their presentation and detailed knowledge about each dish when they are the ones to serve it. 

The chef was excited about each dish, and I loved hearing why he chose each ingredient, where it was from or grown, and why he put each item together on the plate. I love that he supports a lot of local growers and farmers. He was so excited about his creations and it was contagious!

We chose to do the Chefs wine pairing with our dinner. It was an extra cost, but well worth it. The wine sommelier was fun, friendly, and knowledgable about each pairing. It added a nice element to the night and expanded every bite on my palate. Definitely worth it. 

When you are brought to the dining room for your final courses, it's like the kitchen is the stage and you are watching a beautiful play. It might sound crazy, but I teared up at one point during the night, just feeling so in awe of the moment. Watching the kitchen crew was so cool, they were like a well oiled delicate machine. All working in unison, with such grace and ease. I didn't seem like an act just because we were all watching, but rather a true respect for one another and a joy for what they do. The chef invites you to walk around the kitchen and come in and ask questions while they work. 

The overall service was superb. Every staff member was on it, and made you feel very welcome. There were 20 guests at our seating (the restaurant holds 24) and there were about 9  staff members...so the service was highly attentive and genuine down to every single detail. Things I would never have even noticed, but they did. Pretty amazing. 

The ambiance is simple. Elegant. Modern. Minimal. Just perfect. I could have eaten a couple of the courses in the bathroom...it was so pretty! My only recommendation - and this is just because I am trying to think of something, anything to give them some constructive criticism - is the decor of the patio. The furniture is outdated and lacking. Underwhelming, is that a word? It does not go with the interior design of the house/restaurant or with the scheme of the entire evening. In the end, that doesn't even matter because the food and the service took the cake. 

Thank you so very much to the Binkley's for an amazing night that my husband and I will never forget. The cost is high, but well worth it. We are going to start saving for our next anniversary!"	4

618	X1-AbThDu9tmijcGnsi8Ug	0	0	5	Culinary brilliance, pure and simple.  We are so fortunate to have Chef Binkley here locally, as he is one of the few standouts, placing Arizona on the international map of even the most discriminating food adventurers.  Uncompromising standards and the artistry of presentation, comfort and nourishment create an environment in which Binkley's is--undisputedly in our view--the best dining experience in Arizona. Period.  In cities such as New York, San Francisco and Chicago, Binkley's restaurant would undoubtedly command a price of double (or even triple in some cases) what he charges here, which makes the experience a relative bargain.  Enjoy!	0

Comfortable yet spectacular... a new surprise with every presentation. Some roots of his molecular gastronomy background but with farm to table simplicity. The caviar and Kobe add ons as well as the Chefs wine pairing are worth the updrade. 
I have been twice and not one item or wine pairing on the 21 course menu was reproduced 8 weeks later.

Review update: 
I decided to give this location another chance and was met by someone whom I assume is the manager there. Took my take-out order right away, made great suggestions all while being very professional. I made my same utensils dilemma  suggestion to him and he actually exceeded my expectations and included their dine-in utensils with a steak knife. Definitely the Mastros kind of 5 star service hands down. Just wished their receptionists were as properly trained."	1

She got a lemon drop and they use some dry ice concoction so it steams and bubbles for awhile which was really cool. The steaks (filet and ny) were both on point. The shrimp cocktail was unreal. So freakin big and fresh. The butter cake was the best dessert I've ever eaten in my life. See y'all next year!	0

I wish I hadn't been so full from the steak, which made me unable to finish off the mac and cheese or really dig into any of the potato, but what we tried was fantastic. DELICIOUS."	0

I had the 22 ounce bone in Ribeye which I order specially prepared and it was perfect. This restaurant is right on par with Morton's Steakhouse (which I frequent in Naperville, IL) in terms of food quality and flavor. I would have gave it a 5 if not for the noise. It was much louder than usual for an upscale steakhouse.	0

We came back again on a Tuesday Aug. 27th and THE KITCHEN WAS WAY OFF! We came here after restaurant hopping and decide to share a steak, Mac n' Cheese, and Buttercake b/w 3 of us. The steak was ordered medium rare and came out mooing, half alive. The Buttercake that I rave of was overcooked and overly dense. The mac n cheese was Ah-Ma-Zing!! Bad chef night. Not what I would have expected from Mastro's. 

On the upside, I lost my wallet in the bathroom and they were SO helpful in recovering it! Hours later! :)"	1

But, because I've been coming to the Mastro's restaurants for what seems a century, all I will say is 'Perfection'. From the food, to the wine and drink offerings, to the staff and the ambiance. Oh, the ambiance. Take your date here to impress. Take yourself here to eat superb food. A fun place to mingle too. Five stars for all around doesn't do it justice. Everything is addressed at this restaurant and they treat you well, quite well. They go above and beyond to make you happy and content with your dining experience. Side note: Splurge on the Lobster Mash for the table. It's well worth it. Every time! Nobody makes a better ribeye in the valley. Melts in your mouth. I'm hungry now...	0

My waiter was Alan and he was worth the $100+ tip he received from our party of four. City Hall is an experience, not just a restaurant. The food is absolutely fabulous. By looking at the website, you would think this place has a great atmosphere, but it does-the website doesn't do it justice. One tip; go around 5 pm if you want a more intimate experience. Otherwise it gets very loud and is a scene for those who want to be seen. Best dinner I've ever had in Arizona.	0
634	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"We an excellent dinner at Mastro's City Hall last night, reservations for 7:30pm on a Tuesday night and the place was packed which is a testament to the quality of the food and service.  
       We started off with the Ahi Tuna Tartare and Crab stuffed mushrooms and both were of amazing quality, the flavors were out of this word.  The house salad was next and it did not disappoint with the buttermilk bleu cheese dressing, onions, tomatoes, and plenty of Shrimp it could has easily been a meal itself.  
       Now to the main course i had the bone-in ribeye  which was perfectly rare all the way through and charred on the outside and my wife had the bone in fillet medium rare and both were to die for, hands down some of the best beef i have ever experienced.  
       Oh wait i forgot the sides an order of the lobster mashed potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese and the Colossal onion rings all of which exceeded already high expectations.  The mashed potatoes were velvety with loads of flavor and a large amount of lobster incorporated, the Mac was as it should be nice and cheesy without being overdone, and the onion rings were perfect easy to eat because you could actually bite through the onion and it did not slide out after the first bite.  
       The wine selection is one of the best in the Valley with a wide variety of wines uner $100 and plenty of excellent wines above the $100 price point.  We ordered a bottle of Pinot Noir and they discovered that they were out of it and offered one at a higher price for the price of the one i had ordered, they didn't have to but it was nice.         
      Mastro's is a complete experience and it is the little things that they do that make going there better than say Ruth's Chris or another steakhouse in Scottsdale or PV.  
We will be going back much more often and this is now my go to steakhouse in the valley and all others will be measured against it and most likely come up short where Mastro's exceeds.  Also of note it was a little loud but the place was packed and that is to be expected there were business people making deals and people out celebrating so I didn't mind at all."	0

Came here based on recommendations from the king of steakhouses, Spencer H from D.C. 

Atmosphere
Classic dimly lit resto-bar steakhouse, live entertainment and energetic vibe. You have to yell to be heard here. I didn't hear anything from the people sitting in front of me, we had to text few times. Outside patio is only for private events. Same day reservation did the job for our party. Parking is easy, valet or parking lot.  

Service
Fantastic!. From reception to our wonderful waitress to the busboys, all were all smiles. My friend didn't like her initial dirty martini, the waitress happily brought her a sweet cocktail which did the job. 

Food
Your carnivore animal instinct for a good steak will be officially terminated after coming here. Their complementary bread includes about four types of bread. The best are those warm dangerous addicting pretzel baguettes. The rest of the bread was untouched. I recommend they don't serve the rest. 
Not any steakhouse can cook a rib-eye steak nicely. It needs experience and skillful technique. They grill a pretty mean steak at Mastro's Scottsdale. It has the ideal charred surface and the juicy tender meat was so easy to cut. It was a blast of flavor with only salt and pepper on top. Served with grilled asparagus, that's how a steak should be. We shared a rack of lamb and veggies. The lamb was 3.98797970. I like lamb but I believe it is so hard to eat a good lamb in the US. The Mediterranean lamb is the best lamb in the world. Majority of the lamb in the US is imported from Australia or New Zealand. The taste is different. It is less flavorful, tougher and less fatty than the ancient world lamb. Overall, the lamb ribs were great, but I would stick to the rib-eye. It is phenomenal here. For drinks, recently I had an epiphany that water is the only best drink I can have. My water was nice and full of ice. People enjoyed their booze too. 


$$$
Reasonable prices for the experience. For example, $60 for a delicious steak like that one above. They have wagyu beef steaks too. 

After 
Taking a walk after a dinner like this is mandatory. The breeze in Scottsdale was so lovely, fresh air from the desert mixed with some juniper-scented touch. It was a glorious walk not too far from this place. You get a courtesy call from them for routine follow-up. It was a pleasant gesture. 

Recommended? 
Totally!! Pretzel bread you will have. Get the rib-eye!. For ladies, no need for make-up here, it is dim and loud in here and no one will notice anything. Carnivore mode was pretty happy after this."	216

Of course it has to be budgeted for because this place isn't cheap, however the see and be seen crowd is here. Live music in the lounge (the singer is beautiful!) maybe a little loud but the wonderful smell of clarified butter while observing the who's who and the pretenders more than make up for any shortcomings. Prepare yourself for an onslaught to your senses. Strong drinks and a server who will remember what you're having. Salads and appetizers that have been thought out, perfectly cooked and well presented. Unless you're having a seafood tower which is perfect in its decadence: both taste and presentation! Highly recommended and it comes any way you want it. 
On to the steaks. I recommend skipping seafood as a main course. It's a great steakhouse so indulge or go to the chart house! I've had the porterhouse and the filet but if you like miles of flavor, tenderness and and the perfect combination of butter and seasoning, go with the ribeye.. Easily my favorite and the reason I don't save room for dessert. I've tried the desserts but my goal is to to enjoy the perfection of appetizer and meat. Everybody saves room for it except me and certainly not here! I can't wait for my next visit and now I'm thinking about my next steak.. Maybe this Friday?"	0

We went here last Saturday night for our 5 year anniversary. The ambiance was perfect, dim lit with nice aesthetics. The service was on point, waiters took care of everything, were non obtrusive while being very attentive and accessible. The food, I don't know where to start as it was so incredible. They start with a basket of different breads; pretzel roll, Parmesan bread, and sourdough. All equally good and unique. I had the king crab legs and my husband ordered a filet.   Cooked perfect and fresh. We had garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus for  our sides. Sides are big so plan to share them. We had the butter cake for desert. We were both so impressed with the meal here! It was truly wonderful and worth every penny.	1
644	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	2	1	4	We went here to celebrate an early Father's Day.  Service was impeccable but then again, our server was a funny, quirky older gentleman. Perfect for us! Calamari was very fresh but a little rubbery.  Sad because it was so tasty. There were tough, overcooked pieces.  Next we had the French onion soup and it was outstanding! Wedge salad bacon smoky and delicious but a bit dry. Crab legs tender and so fresh. Long bone waygu beef porterhouse perfectly cooked and melted in the mouth! Lobster mashed potatoes were so good but way way too salty. Took them home and ate it slowly the next day, still salty but so good. We'll go back!	2

Atmosphere (4): Quiet for a Tuesday at 6 pm, which was fabulous. Mastro's can get really loud on most nights. We got a great table behind the bat next to the piano (they have live music starting at 6:30 pm which includes a piano player and singers). This was a great way to complete the night after an issue at the bar. Televisions over the bar offered a variety of options (its NBA playoff season so, we were able to catch the game). With almost 3 mins left in the game the bartender changed the channel per the request of the bar patrons. Livid, my husband goes to the bar and asks that the channel be changed back as we were watching the game and there were only 3 mins left. The bar patrons who asked that the channel be changed had the nerve to mention that they wanted to want hockey (btw there was another television in their view). After

Service (3): Though not horribly bad, I'm rating a three based on an issue with my husbands dinner. He ordered a certain steak and the server got the order wrong. When the order came out he made mention that he ordered a different cut. He had already had sides on his plate and midway through bringing a bite to his mouth she reached over with a fork, stuck it in his plate and said, ""I'll take that!"", and ran off with his steak. Gasp! Are you kidding?! No excuse me, no pardon me, nothing. We both just looked at one another and laughed. What can you do? After bringing the meat back three times, we settled because the sides were cold at this point.

Food (4): Outside of the husband having to chow down on sides due to an incorrect main dish order, the food was great. I'm still laying here mad because I'm so full. My pan seared Chilean Sea Bass was excellent. The losbter mac-n-cheese along with the brussel sprouts were great. They brought out a free warm butter cake (you can NEVER go wrong with the butter cake). And the whipped cream, WOW! It's the BEST I've ever had.

Price (4): The price was to be expected here. Mastro's is a very high-end restaurant so, with drinks, dinner and sides, you have to know that your tab will sneak up on you quick. Our bill was a whopping $288 for the two of us.

Overall, I was happy that my husband enjoyed himself on his special day. That's really all that matters. My only issue was that steak. For that kind of money, it'd better be damn perfect (tender, hot, and cooked the way you request)."	0

Steaks were done as ordered and had a great flavor.  Sides of scalloped potatoes were extra creamy, cream corn was prepared using real cream, and asparagus was perfect.

657	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	5	I'm not kidding when I tell you about their bone in filet & their bone in tomahawk steaks!!!! One of THE best steaks in the city hands down! The filet melted in my mouth & they know exactly how to cook them. The place is super busy, but you never feel rushed or like you're not important when dining here. The servers are always a step ahead of you making sure your every need is met & beyond. They serve you like a King & Queen!!! The atmosphere is dark, very dark but they offer you their flashlights to help you read the menu. The server was very knowledgeable about everything, just the way we like it. Try the cheesecake for desert if you want to feel like you've died & gone to Heaven!!!!! Valet was super fast when we wanted to leave & one last thing... There's a wonderful lady in the ladies room who has a little bit of everything for all your women needs! Just the way I like it. If you want the best food, best service, best treatment in al aspects, dine here. Just make sure you make reservations ahead of time so you're guaranteed a table.	1
658	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	My five stars are for the steak! Talk about perfection! There are two things I would change if I was the owner. The dark room is way too dark. Everyone there had to use the flashlight setting on their iPhones to read the menu. Remember I noticed everyone was 45 or so in the place. We all need glasses just to read the menus anyway. Something the owner should change is make it a tad bit more lighted. The pecan pie and choc cake we ordered for dessert had a freezer taste. My first time there so I will try the cheesecake next. Wouldn't ever get that pecan pie again! If you have an excellent menu with main dishes and pride yourself on great food! The owner really needs to get better tasting and fresher home baked goods in. I'm a pastry chef and know good baked goods! These are not fresh baked by any means. Adored the steak! Not the baked goods	0

666	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	4	Great place, good service! We flew in from California on business and decided to have dinner here. Got reservations right away via open table and our table was ready within 10 minutes if our arrival. Ambience was fun and modern and I LOVED the live music. We ordered drinks after dinner just to stay and enjoy the music some more. FOOD: salad was enormous, but delicious. The bread basket was delicious, pretzel bread was in the assortment! Shrimp prawn cocktail was excellent, they were the largest prawns I've ever seen. I ordered surf and turf with petite filet, hubby ordered bone in ribeye. Lobster was delish, my petite filet was overdone. I ordered medium well, it was well done. Hubby ordered his ribeye medium rare and it was also well done. That was a MAJOR disappointment, but steaks were still good, so we didn't send back. Drinks were good also. Since we enjoyed the music so much, we ordered more drinks. I ended up wishing I could have ended up ordering dessert, but once we paid, the waiter didn't come back to us at all.  Pricey, but overall it was a great experience, and we would go back. Next time I'll order my steak rare! ;)	1

My boyfriend and I just went there because we wanted a good steak, we didn't really look at prices or anything before going which we thought was unfortunate because it was a little out of our price range and we were underdressed.  But the prices definitely matched the quality of Mastro's.  We shared the most delicious 20oz NY sirloin and gorgonzola mac and cheese.  It was the best meal we've had in a while. Not only that, they have the most wonderful staff.  After our delicious steak and mac and cheese, they topped off our amazing dinner and gave us a free warm butter cake dessert! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone planning a special night.  It is a perfect date night restaurant!	0
671	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	0	4	"Mastro's certainly impressed my clients. I was told to come here as they were THE steakhouse of Arizona. We all ordered steak and sides, plenty of drinks and wine glasses, as well as the butter cake dessert to top it off.

So glad I did my research here prior to coming. Be prepared to order wisely. I was a bit overwhelmed with the prices at first but then quickly learned that an $18 martini is really 2 martinis (they give you the shaker to hold onto, so that when you're done with your glass, you pour the remaining parts as a second portion). Also for wine - nearly all wine glasses were $18-$25..this was shockingly high at first glance, especially in Arizona. But then learned that they pour 5-6oz glasses rather than 4-5oz, so it's more like a glass and a half. Finally - the sides, at $13 per side with the lobster mac n cheese at a whopping $35, we asked if we could get half portions. Half portions were the perfect amount and they charged $7 instead of $13...everything was so rich, that honestly beyond a half portion would have really gone to waste and not have been finished.

The ambiance is gorgeous in the main dining room as well as the al fresco patio are impressive and elegant. We actually sat in the piano room (we did a walk-in at 5PM) although the entire restaurant was empty when we entered - they sat us at the the high table tops which were a bit too casual for my taste for a lengthy sit-down steak dinner, but we did enjoy the live piano music and singers throughout the evening.

Service was fair - it was a busy evening and the waiters were busy left and right.

The food was delicious but oddly the most memorable part of it was the Butter cake. The steaks and sides were solid and cooked well.

Overall, a solid experience - but would make note and come even more prepared with reservations next time. Mastro's is great for a special occasion or business meals. Great for any size party as well - they do accommodate large parties, too."	1

673	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	4	Went with friends.  Inside was very nice.  Not too loud.  Only complaint I had on the ambiance was the lighting.  I had to use my cell phone flash light app to read the menu.  We had 2 waiters.  Very knowledgeable on the steaks.  One was a bit pushy but not too bad.  Our party of 10 had mostly steaks.  My family really liked their steaks.  All were cooked as ordered and were tasty (I sampled my wife's steak) . I ordered the pork chop.  Very tasty but slightly overcooked.  A few had some starter salads.  Nothing fancy there and not worth the cost (IMO).  We also sampled many of the side dishes.  The lobster mashed potatoes were very good as were the scalloped potatoes.  The green beans could have had more slivered almonds.  The asparagus were the least liked side dish.  Not much flavor.  Most of us had water to drink.  A few of the kids had soda.  They serve the soda in small bottles so each refill ups the $$. Seems a bit tacky that they nickel and dime people on soda.  We sampled 2 of the deserts.  One was a sugar cake.  I really liked it.  The other was a huge piece of chocolate cake.  We all agreed that the chocolate cake was too dry.  Coffee was good.  Nice espresso cup.  All in all, it was a pleasant evening spent with good friends.	0

675	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	4	I have been to the Mastro's in Newport and loved the food. Same goes for this place as well. Minus one star since our martini's were pure sugar mix with just a drop of alcohol. Our waiter was an older, cocky man, that didnt even order our dinner until we finished our appetizers AND salad. We sat there almost 3 hours waiting for our food. He was ridiculous.	0
676	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	0	5	"We were celebrating a special occasion and were treated to this fine dining experience while visiting Scottsdale. Valet parking is offered but if you arrive for an early dinner (before 6;30pm) self parking is convenient. 
We were seated promptly though early for our reservation. Water was promptly delivered to our table though we quickly realized that it was so dark inside and the print was so small on the menu, we all needed flashlights to make our choices. 
Our waiter Michael explained that portions were quite large and easily shareable--given this is rated $$$$, we were happy to share. My husband and I shared an 18oz boneless rib eye, split a wedge and an order of asparagus. It was more than enough food for each of us! (BTW, plates are sizzling hot when delivered to the table--they weren't joking!)
 As a treat, the waiter delivered their famed butter cake, topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and their house made whipped cream on the side! Save room for this delight--again to share! 
It was most definitely one of our finest dining experiences ever. 
Note: the restaurant is quite large, very dark and does get quite noisy. Dine early--it will be more enjoyable!"	0

I've been to a lot of high-class, expensive steakhouses but this one truly stands out. The steaks are always cooked perfectly, the service is phenomenal, and the restaurant itself is beautiful. All the sides we've had have been great, especially the creamed corn, spinach, and twice baked potato. I also love the wedge salad to start. What really stands out from all out delicious meals here is the butter cake. Nothing compares! It may just be the best dessert I've ever had. You must go & get the butter cake. It's especially good along with a cappuccino!	1

We were seated in a small intimate room which was lovely, our server was very accommodating and the food was delicious.  What wasn't right was the men in the longer white coats standing around in the doorways shooting the breeze, fist bumping and overall being unprofessional.  It was even difficult to navigate passed them when I needed to visit the powder room. 
It just really distracted from the ambiance of the evening and was more the behavior of staff at Applebee's or something similar.  Call me crazy but when your spending $66.00 for a steak and $13.00 for a side of steamed asparagus ect, ect there should be more professionalism."	0

692	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	0	5	"This is the best place to grab a steak in the greater Phoenix area. Service is top notch and food is spectacular. Only downside is that the menu is pretty stagnant. Typically nothing crazy in terms of specials, but what does it matter, you're going to get your favorite steak anyway.

Food:

Crab Cakes and Tuna Tartare are awesome for appetizers. Can't go wrong with either one.

Seafood Towers- They will make you a custom seafood tower with whatever chilled seafood you want on it. These are pretty expensive, but are really awesome if you don't mind ponying up the cash. Crab claws are pre-cracked and prepared so that the entire claw of meat comes out in one piece with zero effort. Have had shrimp, oysters, and king crab with the tower before and they are all great. Have dry ice steaming out of the top for a pretty cool presentation.

Steaks- I almost always get the bone-in filet. They cook their steaks exactly how you want them and are seasoned perfectly.

Sides- Lobster mashed potatoes, Black truffle gnocchi, and the mushrooms are all favorites. At this place, I highly doubt anything is sub-par.

MOST IMPORTANT --- Dessert- Get the butter cake. I don't care if you don't like cake, butter, sugar, or just dessert in general. It doesn't matter. It's the best dessert on the planet. I could honestly go just for this. 

Overall, this is my favorite place to go to for a nice romantic dinner. Their service is over the top excellent. I have been here over a dozen times. The only time that I had a mildly bad experience (steak came out very undercooked) the general manager comped the steak and sent me a gift card to come back and have dinner for two on him. I believe his name was Jester. I really appreciated that. City Hall will have my business for life. Don't know how I didn't mention this until the end, but the have really excellent bartenders and make some of the best martinis and manhattans in town."	0

694	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	This is an update to my review of October 14, in which I gave Mastros a poor review. I spoke with the general manager about our experience, and he graciously offered to have me and my date return for another meal, and provided a $200.00 credit towards this. We returned this past Saturday, October 22, and were  personally greeted by the GM, Jess, and escorted to our table. The service was excellent, and the meal exceptional. We began with the ahi tuna tostadas and French onion soup, both of which were delicious. I ordered the 18 oz bone in filet mignon, which was seasoned and cooked to perfection. My date had the Chilean sea bass, which was tender, moist, and delicious as well. The sides of creamed spinach and gnocchi were fabulous, and we ended with the amazing chocolate sin cake. We had multiple servers tending to us, and the service was only surpassed by the food. I have eaten at many fine restaurants around the world, and Mastro's is a fine restaurant, on par with excellent restaurants in New York, London, or Paris.  When you are looking for a romantic restaurant for a special occasion, or any occasion, by all means come here! The attention to making sure we had a memorable experience is rare, and this establishment went above and beyond to rectify our first dinner and ensure we were properly taken care of. A real class act! Well done and thank you!	0
695	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	2	1	5	"This place is legit. Believe the hype. Everything you read. 

We had sides. We had wine. We had butter cake (which was also great- maybe not quite in the category of ""best dessert I've ever had"" but still really good and HUGE to split). But the shining star of the night was the steak, which is how it should be.

I agonized over my choices, since I realized everything would be great but wanted to get the best possible combination of tenderness and flavor. The server recommended the Kansas City, which was a cut I hadn't heard of before. He described it as having the fattiness between a NY and Ribeye, and great flavor. It was cooked perfectly, and oozed steaky amazingness with every bite. It comes out after being broiled at 1200 degrees for a great char on the outside. Some others in my party got truffle butter on their steaks and said it was so over-the-top awesome, but it's hard for me to imagine it would get much better than my steak by itself.

704	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	Came here for a birthday dinner. We ordered lobster mashed potatoes, cream corn and two 8 oz steaks (sirloin). This place is AMAZING. Service was great My friends steak wasn't cooked medium rare it was cooked medium well. We had it sent back. The manager came to our table to apologize he even gave us a discount on our bill. Not necessary but definitely nice knowing how much they care about providing good service to Their customers. Now I don't think I can ever eat cream corn or mashed potatoes any other way! Too good!	0
705	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	Excellent food.  Very pricey but the quality and service is there.  I had the bone in 12oz filet and it was outstanding. Cooked just right and tender and flavorful.  Very active place so do not go there expecting a quiet dinner.  But we like a good atmosphere.  One app, bottle of wine, one side, and 2 filets cost $268 with tip.  Yikes!  But we splurged and couldn't stop commenting on how good every taste was.	0

The steaks are always good and if your not happy with anything let them know and they will gladly fix it.
Lobster Mashed potatoes are good but not worth the cost."	0
707	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	My husband and I like to splurge every now and then on a good meal (preferably steak) so this year we decided to try Mastro's. I looked at previous reviews and saw that many people enjoyed it despite the price.  The hubby and I dressed up for our night out and expected everyone else to be as well.  But when we got there we noticed a few people wearing jeans,  Polo shirts,  and casual footwear. The wait staff was very attentive and friendly.  The dude who cleaned our table after each plate was taken was smiling as if he loved his job. I told him so as well.  He appreciated the compliment. For appetizers I ordered the oysters which were phenominal! I had them all to myself since the hubby is not a fan of them. The steak i ordered was the best I ever had!  I got the bone in cut and was very pleased with the flavor. I like a little fat on my steak. The lobster mashed potatoes was also great. We tried the butter cake but wasn't thrilled with it like other reviews. It was like eating hardened yellow cake. But overall we love, love,  loved our meal. If it wasn't so dang expensive I would go there every weekend.	0
708	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	My favorite steakhouse ever!!! Definitely worth it if you can afford it. The steak is extremely buttery and delicious. The sides are generous portions so think of sharing! Plus the service is beyond amazing. I would definitely recommend the shrimp to start. Make sure to get dessert! The dessert there is to. Die. For. Especially the warm butter cake. Definitely will be returning many times!	0

710	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"My girlfriend and I were in Scottsdale on vacation and had dinner here on April 29th.  I made a reservation through open table for 7pm and when we arrived, we were taken to our table right away. I noticed in other reviews that people complained about waiting, but at 7pm on a Wednesday night, we had no problem.  The server was very good-very personable, asking where we were from and even let us know that a Mastro's in Chicago had just opened-he went over the menu with us and also recommended a bottle of red wine to us.  The Camus 2008 Cab they have would have been nice, but we went with his recommendation as it was a lot less!  I had the bone in ribeye medium rare and the girlfriend had the filet, both fantastic!  Our dessert was the butter cake, which was a large serving and was delicious!  We enjoyed our meal and service was outstanding AND the next day I received a call from Mastro's asking me how my experience was.
I had one minor complaint and that was about the lighting as it was very dark and hard to read the menu-I have noticed this in a lot of high end restaurants though. I know it's to set the mood, ambiance, etc., but still hard to read--not a big deal though as everything else was top notch."	0
711	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	4	"My fiance and I were invited to a birthday celebration for his coworker last weekend and they picked Mastro's for dinner. I had heard great things about this place and was stoked for a good steak, especially since my last steakhouse experience at Donovan's was a little lack luster.

Our party of 6 arrived right on time for our Saturday, 8:45pm reservation and we were sat almost immediately. The atmosphere was MUCH better than Donovan's and while it was much darker, it felt way more intimate and high class. There was some odd music..like the top 40 hits you hear on the radio but luckily our dinner mates were great to talk to and I only noticed it when I sat down.

Our waitress was outstanding the whole evening and the bread basket contained a small, long loaf of pretzel bread that was delicious! I was convinced by another couple at our table that my fiance and I should share the 'Chef's Cut"" Ribeye Chop at 33oz. While I'm a filet fan all the way, I thought I would break out of my norm and go with their recommendation. My fiance and I also ordered the warm spinach salad that was delicious! The egg and warm bacon dressing were so yummy! 

Since we had three couples, each of us ordered different sides to try. We got the $32 Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Yes. $32 for some white potatoes. Now I don't like seafood but these were pretty good. I was able to give my lobster chunks away but they were definitely good and decadent. The other sides we tried were Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese, Green Beans with Sliced Almonds, Asparagus - Steamed. They were all good but at the waitresses recommendation,  we also ordered the creamed spinach. This was one of the top creamed spinaches I've had. Very rich. Very good. 

Another very nice touch was when our dinner was served, we were swarmed by several waiters, each with one of our sides to serve each person at the table. Typically they are placed on the table and you each pass them around so this was a definite nice touch. Our steak was also good but I was reminded about why I order filets. While the meat had a great flavor, all the fat marbled throughout the steak just seemed like too much. Everyone else enjoyed their immensely so maybe I'm just the odd ball? Or because they didn't want to complain for their $60 odd dollar steak. I requested my fiance take me back another time to try the filet to really judge this place :)

Post dinner, our friend was brought out a nice piece of chocolate cake that said Happy Birthday and they even went so far to put his name. Another nice touch. The cake was super rich and I was stuffed so one bite was enough.

While the food, service and ambiance was really good, they lost 1/2 a star for the overly fatty steak and another 1/2 star for a very strong sewer smell upon our exit. Yes, that's probably super picky but everything else had been perfect so it left a tiny bit of a bad impression upon exiting. 

Overall, I'd be excited to come back to this place and try a filet and maybe some other kind of potatoes."	2

City Hall, Ocean Club, or Mastros in North Scottsdale, the steak is impeccable, service is great, atmosphere is fantastic!  If they could improve on anything it's their drinks, the Manhattan's arent very good no matter which restaurant I go to.  So I just get the bottle of red and all's right in the world....and don't forget the butter cake...dont forget it!  You'll be sorry if you miss that!	0

Was a little disappointed in the Alaskan king crab legs as they weren't as big as I would have liked... But, it's a steakhouse and not a seafood joint.  Porterhouse was cooked to perfection.

725	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"Hands down my favorite restaurant in the Phoenix area! The service and attention to detail are incredible; the food is even better! I look for any excuse I can come up with to have dinner here. Most recently, I took my girlfriend here for her birthday. She had never been so I figured it was a good excuse to introduce her to Mastros. 

We had a table for two in the dinning room, at 7:30 on a Saturday (I have also eaten outside, the outside dining area is very nice but small. Make sure you call as far in advance as possible if you want to sit outside). Anyways, when we got there the place was packed. The bar area was packed and there was live entertainment. All the tables in the dining room were taken. 

The service was perfect and our server was always there to fill up our drinks when we needed her. The bread basket contains many different types of bread, however the pretzel bread is by far the best! We started out with salad and the lobster bisque. The lobster bisque is soo rich and is full of chunks of lobster. It's a must order every time! My girlfriend got the filet and I got the New York strip. Both steaks were incredible, but the filet at Mastros is second to none. I won't make the mistake of not ordering filet there every again! For sides we got the lobster mashed potatoes and the asparagus. The lobster mashed potatoes are absolutely incredible! We followed up the meal with the butter cake, which was complimentary because it was girlfriend's birthday. The butter cake is best desert I have ever had. It's so rich and topped with ice cream, fresh fruit and whipped cream. You might as well skip Mastros if you are not going to get the butter cake! 

We had an amazing time and all of the food was excellent. I will certainly return to Mastros as soon as I can find another excuse! Best steakhouse in Arizona!!"	0
726	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	4	4	4	"Entering through large glass motif front doors, our hospital Medical Executive party of five and our medical staff lawyer were greeted by a number of well-dressed hostesses. One immediately notices how dark the bar and restaurant are.  Too dark for me.  The majority of the patrons were noted to be using their cell phones to read the menu. The menu is typical steakhouse with choices of steaks and seafood options. The appetizers were also very typical for a high end steakhouse: including tuna tartare, seared ahi, jumbo shrimp cocktail, mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and shoe-string potatoes. The seating area including the tables, chairs and utensils are very upscale and remind you that you're in a fine dining establishment. The waiter, an assistant and the bus boy greet you politely and introduce themselves by first name. They have an extensive wine list as well as various bottled water options. We started off with the Jumbo Shrimp cocktail. The shrimp were enormous, slightly sweet, and came with horseradish, and cocktail sauce. They were presented over a bed of dry ice making for a very pleasant presentation. The tuna tartare comes out on stacked wonton chips and I believe microgreens.  It was OK. Nothing spectacular. The crab cakes were awful. The crust was extremely tough and peeled off the rest of the cake.  A knife was needed to cut it.  Flavor was nothing special. 

For the entrée, I opted for the 8 ounce filet, along with their shoestring potatoes, and steamed broccoli. 

In between appetizer and the main meal, they made sure to refresh the table, not leaving a single crumb on the table cloth. An additional nice touch, the waiter informed us at certain intervals about how long our main meals would arrive.  On a slightly negative note, we made sure to ask the waiter not to stack our appetizers along with the main meal, and he seemed to take some offense to that. Unfortunately, rushing the appetizer's and quickly bringing the main meal has been a fairly regular occurrence at a lot of the restaurants in Scottsdale. 

The filet came out perfectly cooked medium rare, but had a very rubbery texture which I did not find appealing. It was not melting your mouth delicious but was fairly good. I was expecting a much stronger signature steak product. The steamed broccoli was just that,  steamed broccoli. The shoe string fries were very good. The portion was very generous and not too salted. We also order the mashed potatoes, and the macaroni and cheese. The steak plates came out extremely hot, as they should. However when the macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes were scooped on our plates, they begin to sizzle and became somewhat melted and runny. Not much you can do about that. 

Service was very very attentive and our drinks filled no more than half a dozen times. Our used dishes were removed and fresh forks and knives were replaced as needed in a nonintrusive fusion.  

I happened to be there for a business meeting along with five other people. I did notice that most of the people there appeared to be work colleagues, not families or couples.  

Definitely worth the rating for service, ambience but not overly impressed with the signature steak product."	4
727	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"What's to say that hasn't already been said of this iconic classy establishment? 

I've dined in dining area and in bar area.  Top notch service and amazing food. 

For this review I'll stick to bar area.  

The bartenders-Classy, personable and knowledgeable about the drinks and wine they serve.  The pours are strong and well justified in the price. 

The scene-Definitely ideal for people watching.  Always look your best here. If you are self conscious, go sit in dining area. 

The ambiance-They usually have a piano player and singer or DJ and singer to keep the beat lively.  Usually covering latest songs and classics.  The bar is lit, but semi dark.  Just right setting in my opinion.  

Overall if you are in agreement with my assessment above of a place in Scottsdale you'd like to see and be seen, have amazing food and drinks, and dress up, this is your place."	0
728	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	5	2	5	"Everything Mastro's is always five stars in my book. Perhaps probably one of my favorite restaurants Mastro's City Hall is always memorable. I hadn't been in a while so when tasked with picking a dinner spot this was an obvious choice. If I'm being completely honest, I lost a bet so I had to foot the bill for a night out. I prefer to sit in the bar area since it has a younger, cooler vibe but I've sat in the main dining area as well it's just a little uptight for me sometimes. 

Of course, the wine selection is incredible and the cocktails are expertly crafted. The Mastro's Classic Martini is a must and you have to get the blue cheese stuffed olives. I would also recommend the Elderflower martini {Belvedere citrus vodka | Hendricks Gin | Thatchers elderflower liqueur | fresh lemon juice} 

I can never decide on just one appetizer so we got the beef carpaccio and the sautéed sea scallops. The scallops came out first and were huge and cooked perfectly tender without being chewy. They were sautéed in what I can only assume was butter made by Jesus himself it was that heavenly! The carpaccio was ENORMOUS! The accompanying arugula salad with shaved Parmesan and capers is the stuff dreams are made of. 

For my main entrée I ordered the twin lobster tails. In true Mastro's fashion they came back to the table to explain that their shipment of lobsters were a little on the skimpy side so I would instead be getting quadruplet lobster tails. I of course was fine with that. When they came out it was four normal size lobster tails and they were all amazing! I love how accommodating our server was to the whole experience and especially whenever he deshelled  my lobsters for me without even me even asking.

If for some reason you haven't been here I highly recommend it! Whether it's for a birthday or anniversary City Hall will not disappoint!"	4

Although I don't eat meat people I have been here with have said it is the best filet they have ever had. My personal favorite -- the Ahi Tuna. The portion is huge and the fish is super fresh! For the sides, I dream about the Lobster Mash Potatoes! I am also a huge fan of their brussel sprouts, crab gnocchi and gorgonzola mac and cheese.

As if amazing food wasn't enough reason to go here, the service is spot on too. 

You will leave here full, happy and with a little less money in your pocketbook, but it is completely worth it. Mastro's City Hall or Ocean Club are go to places for a special occasions, date nights, anniversaries etc..."	1

Ribeye was one of the best I've ever had, lobster bisque was also awesome. The sides were good, but the Mac and cheese left a bit to be desired. Honestly though, given the 20 oz medium rare masterpiece that was my main dish, who cares about sides.

The staff always makes us feel special with extra touches on deserts for special occasions. They truly care about every detail. Although they serve many customers even on their busiest nights, they give you all of their attention. Did I mention the steaks are the best I've ever had?!

733	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	2	2	5	"Decadent. 

Need I say more?

We started with wonderful (free) breads and our server warned us the pretzel bread is addictive. My guess is there's 6500 calories per basket of bread, so pacing yourself is key.

We skipped appetizers and dug into Mastro's always excellent steak and seafood. We had an 18 oz bone-in filet and wild caught Columbia River Sturgeon prepared on the grill and slightly blackened. For sides, we had lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. 

For $37, this is the best Lobster Mashed I have tried with a decadent amount of butter- A cardiologist's dream dish!

City Hall was swarming with professional baseball players including my dinner guest. Hence, the bread basket was emptied and the 18 oz filet completely cleaned. City Hall features a wonderful wine list and by my rough estimate, there's 1500 bottles sitting in the very back. Even wine by the glass has a reasonably good selection. Our server tipped us off that we should order out of the right 2 sub zeroes stocked with Screaming Eagle and rare Bordeaux's. 

Excellent meal!

Tables are closer together than expected for an establishment that holds itself out as the ultimate in fine dining.  

Between the five of us,  we had steak,  sea bass,  pork and several sides and appetizers.   It was all tasty but no ""wow"" factor in any of our dishes.

Coming from out of town and receiving the Steakhouse as a recommendation, we didn't really understand that the way most people ordered was to share EVERYTHING, even the steak.  We WAY over ordered and maybe we could have had a suggestion from the person taking our order that it would be too much food for 3 people.  Even after being stuffed, we still had to try the butter cake.  With tip and yes we had a few drinks, it was just under $450.  Quite an expensive dinner for 3, but I don't go all hog wild too often and it was a wonderful treat to end my first Spring Training Adventure and being with wonderful long time friends.

It had so much flavor and was super tender; cutting it feels like a knife through butter. I found it better than Fleming's and Morton's steaks. For sides, the Sautéed Mushrooms were tasty and not too salty. The Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese is delicious, tops among the steakhouses we have been to. The Lobster Mashed Potatoes are amazing and flavorful, though quite expensive ($35). The mash is made separately, then large pieces of fresh lobster are stirred in tableside by the waiter, ensuring the mash isn't too lobstery and that it retains the two distinct flavors.

The first time we came, it was our anniversary so we were gifted a complimentary Chocolate Sin Cake. It was fluffy and not too overpoweringly chocolatey. The second visit, we had to make sure we tried the Warm Butter Cake, since it has its own Twitter handle and all. It was served warm with ice cream and was topped with freshly whipped cream and assorted fruits. It was delicious. We only finished half, so we took the rest home (including the extra whipped cream), and it still tasted great the next day.

Service was great both times; the wait staff was friendly, helpful, and professional. Overall, they provide a great experience that leaves us wanting to return as soon as we leave."	2

If something happens to be wrong, they will gladly replace it or re-make it.  They look to provide a memorable experience and meal every time here.

748	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	4	"Decided to eat here since I was craving a real good steak. Reservations were for a Friday night during AZ season (busy season). Valet was quick and prompt which I liked. Walking into the place, it was PACKED. I figured this was going to be the case, which is why I made reservations. We were not sat immediately, however we didn't mind and decided to get a drink at the bar. 

Once sat, we were given an entire sh-peel. Our server was very knowledgeable, but seemed a little rushed. Wasn't alarming so I didn't mind it. My partner and I started off with some oysters Rockefeller. They were pretty good and better than some of the other places I have had them at. For the main course, we ordered the bone in filet's and side of 4 mac and cheese. I ordered a cool blue rare and found it a little more on the red rare side (some of you steak eaters might know what I mean). It wasn't a big deal, as long as it was rare haha. Wine was good and so was the service. 

I enjoyed eating here and will be going back next month."	0

My wife wanted to get two more orders and skip the entrees.We ordered the filet and lobster tails for our dinner, the best. As a bonus they gave us their signature desert for free. Now the service, we had the best server of any of our previous eating experiences.It's a little noisy, but with outstanding food and service you can put up with some noise	0

Everything (prime rib, creamed spinach, mac & cheese, Malbec) was phenomenal.  I'm not a dessert person, and I wolfed down that warm butter cake that you'll see so many reviewers mention.  It was busy (Saturday night), and parking might've been problematic, except that we used the valet.  If you're going to treat someone to a nice dinner, I say that you do it here.  Absolutely one of the better restaurant experiences that I can remember.	0

My wife and I stopped here at the end of a trip for our anniversary dinner.  We were greeted by friendly staff and had a waiter whose professionalism and top-notch service only added to the meal.

Our steaks were cooked perfectly to order.  Medium-rare.  While the atmosphere is a little more lively than most steak houses in this price-range, the noise made for a fun and friendly feel.  The slice of chocolate cake with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate was a nice touch.

This was a steakhouse done right."	1

Minus one person who brought us over a wine bottle and I made a comment it seemed like a busy night and that was awesome . What I got back from the man was they were always busy and this was nothing that a place like this one is fortunate even for new customers they appreciate everyone no matter what value something really uncomfortable was said making us feel like this must be our first time at a place like this ??? Ugh first of all we've paid 150.00 for one steak at a wonderful steak house we love on a random Monday for no occasion we appreciate a great piece of meat... Besides him our server and the bus boys were magnificent and honestly very attentive. The valet outside was so nice to we appreciated our night out !	0

You must start off with a martini...not just any martini, make sure they add in the dry ice!!  So fancy!
The shrimp cocktail is scrumptious, we always add on an extra shrimp bc it only comes with 3...the shrimps are also pretty big and meaty!  The cocktail sauce, careful, i love it, but the horseradish is very strong in it.  Tears will roll...down your happy face
Any finally, the entree....petit filet is perfect for me...comes out on a sizzling hot plate...ugh, my mouth is watering.  This is actually the first and only restaurant where o have not asked for steak sauce...the steak is so flavorful, juicy and perfectly seasoned that it is melt in your mouth perfect all by itself.
We love getting the lobster mashed potatoes as a side, as well as any green veggie.
Mmmmm, let's go already!!

Came here for a work dinner and got some funny looks for being in scrubs, but the food was out of this world delicious and the wine was fantastic. The dessert was to die for, they didn't miss a single detail. The main dining area is a bit dark for my liking, it's tough to see the other people in your party, but I guess it's all in the ""mood lighting.""

We spent our 3 year anniversary here at City Hall Mastro's in Old Town Scottsdale.  We had a great table in the bar area where we could see everything going on and listen to some great music.  The service was great, decor was lovely, and the location is perfect.  

We started with the calamari as an appetizer and it was delicious.  I had the Chilean Sea bass and he got the 12oz Filet Mignon. For sides, we got the creamy spinach, gorgonzola macaroni and cheese, and the scalloped potatoes......of course we split everything.  I was quite surprised at how much I love the scalloped potatoes...... I'm getting hungry just thinking about all this food.  

Also, the staff came over and surprised us with a chocolate cake for our anniversary.  It was the perfect way to end the night."	2

We enjoyed our beverages and were then treated to a seafood feast with the Seafood Tower.  I especially liked the shrimp and crab.  We had the steak, salmon and salads and everyone raved about their entree. We shared mushrooms, brussel sprouts, asparagus, and best of all, the lobster mashed potatoes. We celebrated a birthday and were treated to the amazing butter cake.	0
770	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	2	4	"I came here for a business dinner in which we were entertaining a customer and give it 4.5 stars.  I think this restaurant is a fantastic dinner out if you are paying with a company card, but I am not sure I would return if I were coming on my own dime.  First the positives.  The food was outstanding.  The seafood tower was the highlight for me.  Everything was so fresh and delicious.  The oysters in particular were fantastic.  I also loved the ""atomic"" horseradish.  I am big fan of spicy, and that hit the spot.  My steak was very good but my colleague's sea bass was even better -- I think I would get that over the steak if I were to return.  The sides were all outstanding.  The lobster mashed potatoes were amazing with huge chunks of lobster and the gorgonzola mac n cheese was SO good.  The roasted brussel sprouts were also fantastic.  The butter cake dessert was also delicious.  Our waitress did a great job with wine recommendations and everyone was really pleased with the bottles she helped pick out.  Service was excellent and at the level to be expected at a place like this.

There were a few negatives however that prevent me from giving out that elusive fifth star.  The restaurant itself is very dimly lit, to the point where the waitstaff carries flashlights for the wine list.  I did not love this, but not a big deal.  Our waitress was pleasant but she upsold everything.  All of her recommendations were the most expensive items on the menu and she convinced us on several occasions to go for more expensive items than we originally planned to order.  I have to hand it to her, she's a great saleswoman, and since it was not my own money, I did not mind.  However, if I were here with my husband and we were paying, I would have found that irritating.  The other annoyance was the bathroom attendant.  I really hate having to spend a dollar every time I go to the bathroom.  It's just an awkward experience having someone turn on your water and pump your hand soap, totally unnecessary.  And finally, as I mentioned previously the steak was really good but it was not amazing, which is what I was expecting based on the waitress's description.

I would definitely recommend Mastro's for a corporate dinner out and would love to return if I am in the area again on business."	1

The service was excellent.  Just what you would expect.  On to the food.  The fresh bread that they bring to the table was delicious.  We started with the Tuna Tar Tar tower.  It is hit the mark.  Then it came time for the main event.  Of course we went with the lobster mash.  yes they lived up to the hype.  So delicious and filled with lots of lobster.    My wife has a wonderful bone-in rib eye steak.  It was cooker perfectly and tasted delicious.  I went for the chefs cut NY Strip.  To my disappointment it was cook well done and not medium.  The cooked a new one for me, but still missed the mark.  The steak was very charred and closer to rare than medium.  However I did not let this run my meal or the evening.

After dinner was over the wonderful waitress set our table for dessert.  We had not placed an order, but she severed us their famous Butter Cake.  It was simply delicious.  My wife agreed with the waitress that it was life changing.  

While I was sad that my steak did not hit the mark, I was still very pleased with the evening.  Besides my was was extremely happy.  So happy wife, happy life."	1

Had dinner here tonite with family.  from beginning to end the service and the food was outstanding.  I had the chopped salad, salmon and the table shared asparagus, lobster and mash potatoes and mac and cheese.  Everything was outstanding--although we didn't, the salads are plenty enough to share.  my salmon was flavorful and cooked to perfection--the mash potatoes and lobster and mac and cheese however were sublime.  Our server was fabulous--timed everything perfectly.    From now on--I am going to remember how this level of service and quality of food makes for a great evening.	1

The ambiance is elegant and sophisticated, but the low lighting takes some adjustment or the help of a flashlight app. The service was friendly, professional and excellent. The wine prices tend to be on the high side but the ""by the glass"" pours are generous. The food is also expensive but the quality is outstanding, the portions generous, and the sides are definitely sized to share. Leave room for justifiably famous the butter cake! If you come prepared to spend $$$$, you won't be disappointed!"	0
778	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	4	"My husband and I were fortunate enough to come here with a hefty gift card from his bosses. We both tend to watch what we spend, so it was nice to have the freedom to order things we normally might not have. If I judge our meal through the ""I didn't pay for it"" lens, I would give Mastro's four stars. 

However, having been to other high-end steakhouses like Donovan's, Capital Grille etc. I'm not sure I would rate Mastro's quite as high. While the steak I had was fairly good, it didn't come close to the quality and flavor I've had elsewhere. The same could be said for the side dishes (scalloped potatoes and brussels sprouts) - fairly good, but I've had better. When the waiter asked if I wanted truffle butter on my steak, the answer was ""Sure!"" Again, because I had a gift card. I was shocked to see on the bill that a pat of butter was $15!! I know truffles are expensive, but damn! Lastly, we went for a butter cake to share. I found it to be mediocre compared to (yeah, I have kids and I'm going to actually say this!) California Pizza Kitchen's.

I guess what I'm trying to say here is that if I'd visited without a gift card to splurge with, I might not choose to come back. Yes, the food is good and the service is attentive. I just think you can get better quality meals for less around the valley, even at a comparable high-end steakhouse like Donovan's."	1

The food and drinks were very good from what I sampled.  I ordered a dirty martini w/ three blue cheese olives, and the bartender made it just the way I like it and gave me the excess in a shaker to keep @ my table.  

The scallops here are amazing... they are seared to perfection and the sauce served with them is absolutely delicious!

The service here was SUPERB, but my review may be a bit biased because my friends date seemed to know most of the staff by name ... So I can't say that it would always be this good ...

I did try a bit of the butter cake, and despite many people raving about it... I am not a fan... it was verrry sweet and heavy - it actually gave me an upset stomach/indigestion afterwards... but that isn't too surprising since I rarely eat ""cake-like"" desserts like this... 

The atmosphere is ehhh you know old townish - it appeared like more of a mature crowd, which isn't surprising because the tab on 3 drinks @ the bar was nearly $60.  It's nothing glamorous or super ritzy as I thought it would be.... It's actually way more chill and of course it was suuuuper busy since it was fri night!  

So does it live up to the hype and did it meet my expectations?  

Well this is a bit tricky to answer, because I figured it would be high end/classy and that it would be expensive ... And YES it was!  The overall scene though was just alright for me - the look of the interior of this place is nice, but nothing to brag about ... There are a lot of similar places in Scottsdale, but I must admit the did sear/season their scallops to perfection!! But similar to other mastro's - it's quite expensive and I'm not really sure how fast I will be returning ... I would rate it a very good, but not the best bang for the buck, but they do have quite an extensive menu - they even had wagyu beef in their menu!"	1

I made reservations using Open Table and noted the special occasion. We were promptly seated upon our arrival and the ambiance was pleasant. There was a small band alongside a piano player playing top chart music and provided a great relaxed atmosphere. 
Our food was great and came out piping hot! We each had the fillet- cooked EXACTLY as we ordered...which is always a plus by me. Also, we split the macaroni and green beans. For dessert, we were treated with a birthday butter cake with a rich and decant ice cream...that alone would have been a great treat on its own. 

The only small ""complaint"" I have is the wines. Two weeks ago I bough the ""Crush"" Dreaming Tree Wine for 15.00 at Frys...it is a great smokey, red blend. But, the bottle was $40 on the menu. What is the difference? Will the wine bottle at Mastro's make me poop gold eggs? If so, I'd buy it...otherwise...no thanks.

Above all ...the service was fantastic! I really appreciated the quick response to fill my drink and provide recommendations.

This was our first experience at a Mastro's restaurant, so we didn't know what to expect.The service was top-notch from start to finish. I truly felt taken care of throughout the entire evening. 

I started off with the Dream Berry martini, which was delicious. I love that they leave the shaker with the second serving of your beverage on the table. The bread and butter was also great; we had to keep ourselves from eating too much of it before the main course. We split the caesar salad which was also good and had delicious croutons.

I ordered the petite filet with a lobster tail and the Alaskan King Crab black truffle gnocchi for my side. One of the specials was the black truffle butter that you can get for your steak, which I ordered as well. My bf had the NY strip and the garlic mashed potatoes for his side. 

Everything was cooked to perfection. My filet was the best I've ever had and the lobster was buttery and tender. The truffle butter and gnocchi were both divine. My bf thoroughly enjoyed his steak as well and raved about the potatoes.

We finished our evening with their famous butter cake. This in my opinion could've used more sauce and fruit to offset the heaviness of the cake. But overall it was still very tasty. Mastro's won us over with it's wonderful service and food. We'll be back again soon!"	0

The Bone-In Ribeye was one of the best I've ever had. My wife's Filet was cooked perfectly and should wouldn't hesitate to tell you if it wasn't. The sides were good as always and the Butter Cake for dessert was a great ending. 

Our waitress was friendly and polite but she seemed to be rushed. She still got a great tip nonetheless. 

And lastly, this may be weird to mention, but I have to give a shout out to Knoxy in the men's bathroom. He's a 90 something man who's always good for a laugh. 

It's certainly pricey, but the portions and quality are worth it. We'll definitely be back."	0

There was never a time that we felt ignored, nor were we feeling rushed. And this was a Saturday night. Drew really knew his job, the menu, and the specials for the night which were plenty. This was my first time here, but the other couple had eaten there a few times, and helped pick the items that were the best. We decided to do many appetizers and sides and then the wife and I decided to split the porterhouse steak. We had the marrow, crab claws, gnocchi, macn cheese. The service was outstanding as well. Can't wait to go back.	0

The lobster bisque was perfect.  The rack of lamb was prepared perfectly and served sizzling on a hot plate.  The flavor was good but not as good as I was anticipating.  The chef's cut NY strip was great.  Charred and cooked perfectly.  Of course the lobster mashed potatoes are on point! The creamed spinach is not too shabby either.

The desserts were off the chart.  The butter cake is stellar and the cherry cobbler divine.

We typically sit in the bar unless its a special occasion. The lighting is nice and the atmosphere is more casual. There is almost always live music but be careful not to sit to close if you care about having a conversation because it can be a little loud.

Leona and Brit always take amazing care of us in the bar area. You are sure to get one of these great ladies if you seat yourself at one of the high top tables. 

The filet is amazing as is the chefs cut New York, the lobster mashed potatoes are worth every penny, but the buttercake is the bomb!! Save room.... Sure it might be a few dollars more than the other local steakhouses but the service is always impeccable and the steaks are always served at correct temperature the first time. I would give it six stars if I could, City Hall is a sure thing I've never had a bad meal here."	6
804	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	Probably the best steaks in the state. Great service every time I go. You never have to wait for anything to be refilled. Food can take a bit of time but it's worth it. Here are two musts when you go. Sea scallops and butter cream cake. If you're worried about not having room for dessert then order the butter cream cake first.  You won't be disappointed. The main dining area can be quite noisy so request a table in the back dining room it's much quieter and more spread out.	0

Butter cake, was very good and as always service is generally outstanding."	3
806	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	4	The only reason why this place scored as high as I'm giving it is because of the service of a couple of the ladies there. The food was not what I had come to expect out of this place. I've eaten here probably two or three other times and was satisfied but this was not one of those times. I was by myself waiting for someone to get done with their conference in the back so I sat alone. My server treated me as if I were there with a party of ten and gave me plenty of attention. I had a martini which was excellent seeing it was huge with the shaker on the side. I had an appetizer and the steak with the bread pudding and I'd give it 3 of 5 stars. Pricey? Sure but it's what I expected coming here and I'd come back but these folks need to step it up in the kitchen if they want to compete because there's plenty of competition around.	0

I took my wife to Mastro's City Hall for our anniversary. Making a reservation was a snap with the Open Table option on Yelp. 
The restaurant was a little dark, but I suppose that was just the atmosphere they wanted. We were sat at our table as soon as we walked through the door. The waitress was at the table within a couple minutes and complimentary bread shortly after that. 
We both ordered lobster bisque for a starter, which was fantastic, but we could probably have gotten away with one order as the bowls were huge! 
My wife got the petite filet and I got the halibut. Both of which were delicious as well. At this point we were both very full, but since it was our first time in the restaurant, the waitress brought us dessert which was even SO good! I couldn't stop eating it even though I was full.
It's VERY pricey (hence the four stars and not five) but, would recommend City Hall to anyone that has a special occasion coming up."	0

That night, we wanted to go all out so we each ordered our own steak and had the lobster mashed potatoes, and the butter cake for dessert. All of it was amazing. 

Most recently we tried it out a second time because we had gotten a gift card. They had sat us in the back of the restaurant but I requested to be seated in the main dining room and they of course moved us right away to a great little booth. I like the main dining room better because it has a see and be seen vibe to it and you can hear the music from the lounge area which is always great.

Every time I go there we will always get the stuffed mushrooms and request extra pretzel bread. Every time I take a bit of those I just wish I knew how to make them myself. For main course we decided to share the Chef's cut Rib Eye and get the Mac n cheese and Brussel sprouts. I highly recommend if your shying away from Mastro's because of price, that is an excellent option. You get an unbelievably juicy and delicious steak, they split it for us into 2 plates and the sides were delicious. Thanks for another amazing night out Mastro's. Nailed it."	1

The atmosphere is upscale but rather loud due to the live music and the massive size of the place.  They really pack people in here!! 

 I usually order the petit filet(8 ounce),  medium rare, and it is perfect every time. A word of warning. . . Unless you have a massive appetite, go easy on the sides!  Bread service is fabulous with my favorite, the pretzel bread, and sides are in family-size portions.  Unless you like taking food home (I don't when on vacation), plan on an entree and splitting a side with someone.  Oh, and another word of warning, the plate comes out sizzling, and it pops and sizzles a little to surrounding surfaces, so I wouldn't wear silk or anything not dark.  

Service is spectacular, with knowledgeable and attentive servers.  They truly value the happiness of their customers.  A definite must-try if you like steak."	3

Suzy is this locations event coordinator and she was fantastic about sending me all menu options, customization options, and pricing along with times. The room rental had a minimum spending point of 1,500. With a few bottles of wine and premium food selections, it wasn't hard to reach.

When I arrived at 5:00 for the 5-8pm reservation there were no delays and I was immediately taken back to a room with a fully dressed table along with personalized menus. We ordered everything family style. Seafood tower, Wagyu, scallops, filet, ribeye, lobster tails, prawns and Chilean sea bass. We also had three young children with our party and our server was lots of fun and made everyone feel welcome. The service was unrushed and very prompt.

This steak is flavorful, perfectly cooked, and felt like it could be cut with a butter knife. The service is top notch and they make you feel comfortable asking questions. It's a bit dark inside,  but the waiters have flashlights. It will be hard to go back to Prime Rib, Ruth's Chris, Morton's, or Donovan's. Enjoy...it's totally worth the money.	1

My steak is always prepared perfectly well and butterflied to perfection. YUMMY?!?!?!!!! Can you say: ""Warm Butter CAKE""? Well take a bite and you will just say WOW! I don't care for sweets but this is a must try! When ordering sides make sure you ask for light oil or butter, they soak in in the dishes but that is what makes it soooooooooooo good. Make sure you drink a lot of H20 for the sodium in the food will guarantee to get you swelling (in a good way) especially if you mix your food with a Xtra DIRTY Martini + Extra Olives.

He was attentive without being intrusive, handled all issues promptly and efficiently, and made us feel welcome and comfortable. Although my steak was overcooked, they immediately made that right. 

My only criticism is their cocktails. We paid $20 for a standard Manhattan that was served shaken rather than stirred as it should have been. As a result, the the balance of my drink was watered down. Standard spirits were utilized, so the $20 price made no sense. In addition, the drink was served with a standard maraschino rather than a Luxardo cherry, which was disappointing considering they have the Luxardos on hand for other cocktails. 

That said, we'll definitely return but will just stick to wine with dinner. Try the lobster mashed potatoes... They're amazing."	2

my husband and I went for our one year anniversary and it was epic. We Ordered The Sautéed Shrimp App And The Sauce Is A Garlic Butter Sauce. I could just drink the sauce. 
Then for our meal he ordered the porterhouse and I ordered the bone in filet Oscar style which came with lump crab meat and a bernaise sauce on top. Both came out perfect. For sides we had the infamous lobster mash which is a must. Huge lumps of lobster. Also the mac and cheese, green snap peas, and Brussel sprouts with bacon. Yes We Went All Out. 
As if that was not enough, we ended with a butter cake. It had a delicious sugar crust and was so surprisingly light.

They had a live band playing and it was a very happening kind of place, it was packed.

Ate outdoors next to the giant fireplace, which was great as it was Christmas. Prime rib, lobster tail, scalloped potatoes, creamed spinach, strawberry mule. I haven't had a meal like this in a long time. All the food and drink was top of the line. It's been almost a month and we still talk about the perfect experience. This is the level of quality you really don't find much these days. Inside seemed crowded and loud, so if your looking for something more intimate, definitely reserve a spot on the patio.	1

The crab stuffed mushroom caps and the seared ahi tuna apps were wonderful, but the real highlight was the filet.  It was not as thick as the filet I have come to expect from so often visiting Bob's Steak and Chophouse in San Francisco, but it was perfectly cooked and had a slight crispiness to the outside of the steak which was wonderful.  I would be hard pressed to say it was as good as Bob's, but it could be a very close 2nd place.

A friend told me to try the lobster mashed potatoes, but they were not on the menu the day I was there.  So if reading this stimulates your desire to eat at Mastro's don't forget to add this to your order.

I had called twice to confirm time and seating preference and also to make sure that they had the right thing written down on the card that they leave on the table for special occasions. But when we got there the table was wrong and they did not leave the card on the table. I voiced my opinion to the hostess and a manager immediately appeared and made it up to us with a bottle of champagne, very nice. Second, I waiter was great, but he was so busy with other tables that we rarely ever saw him. But, the food was absolutely AMAZING !!! I will only order a steak from city hall because it puts every other steak offered at any restaurant to shame... Even the side that we got, scalloped potatoes and the piece of cake they brought my wife for her birthday were AMAZING... Will absolutely be back and will recommend to friend and family.	0

service was excellent, ambiance above par, price $$$ sides were above par the steaks on the other hand sadly were overcharred.

group of 6 dining we all ordered steaks over the 12oz barrier, I chose the coveted 32oz Chefs Cut Rib Eye chop. Lets just say the steak was buttery, heavy, tender, everything you want and more except that char on the outside, literally the char was a tad over kill, if you have to shave off the burnt off your steak to get to the steak there is something wrong. Again steak was excellent minus that char!!

the sides:
Bone marrow - ***** scoop it out and butter it up all over the toasted bread you are given, if not eat is straight as it is meant to be eaten, oil, buttery, deliciousness!!!!
clam shell mac with buttery cheese - **** what I ate was above par I think the oil from my steak may have skued the taste but was wrong with adding steak juice to your meal haha
lobster mashed potatoes - ***** what is not to like, lobster and lobster juice with mashed potatoes camon win win
Gorgonzola mac & cheese - *** not a real fan of mac and cheese but their's was decent
I know there were two other things our group got but I do not recall what they were or if I tasted them

food *** for the steak, **** for the sides

The mushrooms and creamed spinach were an added bonus! We sat outside on the heated porch and it was perfect for our family. I was a little concerned about being cold but the heaters overhead and beside us left is quite toasty while we dined.  Our waitress, Sara, was exceptional.  This will be on our list of favorite restaurants!	0

854	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"We have been to most of the great steakhouses in the Valley and after were done we always think we should just have gone to our standby of Mastros!  We love City Hall and visit the Ocean Club frequently as well.
Their seafood towers are fabulous and a great way to impress clients since they come out smoking!  As does my fave martini, the lemon drop that also has dry ice!  We have had fabulous service nearly overtime we've been there. 
I almost always get the Big Eye Tuna which is the best tuna in the valley!  My husband gets a filet so it is the best of both worlds.  The sides are also amazing, we always get the brussel sprouts, broccoli and some kind of sinfully good side like mac and cheese or potatoes!  

But my fave part of every meal is dessert and they don't disappoint on that either.  I am a sucker for chocolate so for a hot dessert you can go wrong with the chocolate pudding (hot must cake with ice cream-fabulous) but the sin cake and chocolate layer cake are also amazing. If your not a chocolate fanatic the pecan pie and key lime are also great!  We love Mastros and wouldn't recommend anything else as of yet!"	0

Nice wine choices.
We started out with the crab cakes as an appetizer followed by the French onion soup.  Both were amazing!  
For our meal we ordered the filet and was not impressed.  The steak was suppose to be medium however it was mostly red and cold in the center.  Not a lot of flavor.
Sautéed asparagus and Gorgonzola mac and cheese as the sides... both good.
Best part of the night was the butter cake for desert!  It was to die for!!"	0
857	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	0	5	Absolutely, positively my FAVORITE Mastro's EVER (and I LOVE Mastro's).  Went there for dinner unexpectedly while in town for a funeral---they were very accommodating, even though we changed our reservation 3 times (first, the time changed twice, then we had more guests than originally anticipated).  They were totally OK with that.  The server--Lauren, was HANDS DOWN the absolute best in the business.  We are accustomed to nice restaurants and as such, recognize quality service when we see it, but Lauren was over the top amazing.  As always, the food was perfect, the only problem being that there was too much of it!   Imagine my surprise when they brought out chocolate (my fave) cake with happy birthday written on the plate ( a week early).   We rarely have dessert, but under the circumstances, had to try it and it was delectable as well.  This Mastro's is a far cry from the really crappy experience we had at the Malibu Mastro's.  I almost swore off my favorite restaurant because of the management there, but thankfully, Lauren and the crew in Scottsdale has renewed my faith in this chain.  Oh, and did I mention?  They called the next day to see how everything was---a very nice touch!	2

I'm still a huge fan of the infamous lobster mash potatoes. I highly recommend them!  

This is my first time with the butter cake. Wow! There's a reason this is their signature dessert.

I was happy to see French Bordeaux on the wine list. Not many restaurants carry international wines. 
The steaks we ordered were prepared very well, and the 400 degree plates had a certain je ne sais quios. We tried the Lobster Mash Potatoes, and they were the perfect accompaniment.
Dessert is to die for! The Warm Butter Cake and Pecan Pie were huge, and soooo dang divine.
The service was wonderful.
An overall memorable dining experience.

I had to add to my review. The restaurant called after our reservation for a follow up on our experience at Mastro's. This restaurant just went above and beyond our expectations. We already have future reservations with out of town guests."	0

The decor was beautiful & the ambiance was perfect. 
... Now for the fun stuff, 

Appetizer| I highly recommend, the Dungeness crab & shrimp tower as an appetizer. The crab cakes and lobsters are also phenomenal .  

Entree| The steaks & lamb chops were bar none- cooked and season to perfection. 
We came back the next night and had the blackened salmon which was perfectly season and tender. 


Dessert| You MUST try the warm butter cake. You will not be disappointed! T
The chocolate cake cake was good, no complaints. 


All in all, I had a perfect experience! Thanks Mastro's"	0

We love ordering the decadent crab gnocchi, green beans with almonds, asparagus, oysters... You name it and they will blow your socks off. This place is a carnivore's dream! Filet for me and a bone in filet for the hubby!

We always eat in the bar area - more lowkey and the people watching is some of the best. Britt and Leona ALWAYS and I mean always take great care of us. 

In all the times I've ate here (probably at 75-100 times now), they have always made my steak perfect. Never had to send a thing back. What other steak joint can say that?? 

And now the best thing about the place...Sorry steak and service, you are awesome BUT the best thing is the buttercake. Greatest dessert in the world. Better get u some!!"	3

871	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	4	"Hands down my favorite steak house in all of Arizona. It is definitely a bit hoity toity, and high class but the food and service is unbeatable. Last weekend when I went there I got the 6 oz filet, my girlfriend got the Chilean sea bass, and we got 3 sides which were the mushrooms, crab gnocchi, and snap peas. The steak was perfectly done medium with a little char on the outside just like I like it; and I ordered truffle butter on top (weirded out by saying that thanks to that one song). I tasted my girlfriends Chilean Seabass and it was crispy on the outside but tasted like butter on the inside; which is exactly how Chilean Seabass should be. Now for the sides, they were all delicious but the snap peas here are the best because they are crispy on the outside and not too chewy, but I am pretty sure it's because of the loads of butter that they use when cooking them. Oh and also we got two appetizers, the calamari which was delicious and then the tuna jalapeño sashimi which tasted amazing but had a huge downside... 


Now for the downsides...They give you chopsticks to eat the sashimi with and anyone who has ever eaten sashimi knows you can't eat it with a fork so chop sticks are appropriate, now the down side of these chop sticks is that they are plastic and super slippery.. Yeah it was pretty much impossible to pick up the sashimi because with the oil and sauce they use the sashimi slips right through the chopsticks.. We had to literally move the sashimi to the side of the plate where it was hanging off to the side and then pick it up with the chopsticks and naturally some pieces fell off and eventually we just sort of gave up on it so please if you are reading this change to crappy old wooden chop sticks. Another downside is the price... I mean this place is ridiculously expensive, the cheapest bottle of wine was $100!! We got the cherry pie Pinot Noir and it was $135 despite being $15-20 at the store. And when I ordered all of this for two people my bill ended up being like $450 for two people... I would say a bit expensive. So change the chop sticks and you will get a 5 star, maybe make it a bit cheaper but I understand the service is amazing and so is the food so I can't really blame them for that."	0

874	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	It's almost ridiculous just how amazing this place is!  My boyfriend took me here on a whim while visiting Scottsdale...and it changed my life!  We sat at the bar and ordered the lemon drop. First, it's HUGE and is actually enough for two.  They put dry ice in it simply for affect, but the flavor is outstanding--we ordered one each. :)  We then ordered the 12oz filet and the wedge salad.  The portions here are sizeable so we split the meal and it was perfect.  The filet was UNREAL...it was tender and had AMAZING flavor.  We also got a side of their horseradish cream...REDUNK!! VERY spicy and VERY GOOD!  I prefer my filet a little on the medium-well side but we ordered it medium which was perfect for my  boyfriend.  Since we split the meal, the waiter brought me my own scorching hot plate...hot enough to sizzle my filet to perfection!  The waitstaff and bartenders were attentive and informative.  It seems like the staff enjoy working here.  The overall vibe of City Hall is classy, sexy, and although a bit pricey...WELL WORTH EVERY $$!!  This place is a definite MUST every time we're in Scottsdale!	1

We started dinner with a glass of wine (Trefethen Cab) and my friend had a beer.  We started dinner with a shrimp cocktail, the horseradish is strong but very good . . . Cleared my sinuses. We ordered the Mastros house salad, the wedge, two bone in rib eyes, creamed spinach and the mashed sweet potatoes. Everything was perfectly preferred and tasted great!

Sarah surprised my friend with a Birthday Butter cake which we devoured even after being stuffed.  I highly recommend Mastro's for special occasions, romantic evenings, business dinners and just to treat yourself. 

Thank you for a wonderful night Mastro's!  I will be back."	2

I have been to many top name steakhouses, including the Mastro's in Las Vegas, but this particular location left me smiling and raving into the next day. Our waiter's name was Corel and not only did he provide great insight to the menu, he was very personable and kind. We were never left asking for anything or waiting for him to come around. He engaged in such fluid conversation with my husband and I and found that we are military. When our bill came he had provided us with a military discount that we were unaware of and topped of our meal with a complimentary cake, to our surprise, for the occasion. The food was incredible and I are until my stomach literally hurt. I found myself making ""mmm"" noises every time I bit into an item on my plate, my husband and I could not decide who had the better order. I highly recommend Mastro's in Scottsdale for anyone looking for a nice meal and incredible dining experience."	1
882	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	Best dinner of my life. High end steak houses can be pretentious but not Mastro's they no how great they are but they are still humble about it. The bone in filet is life changing, their cocktails and wine lists are to die for. There is nothing that I do not love love love about this place!	0

You Must Order: 
1) Shrimp Cocktail (served on a steaming platter with delicious and spicy horseradish)
2) Bone-in Filet (one of the best steaks I have had)
3) Warm Butter Cake (it doesn't matter how full you are, just order it - it's life changing) 

Of course, the bread bowl they set on the table is amazing (especially the pretzel bread), but you will regret filling up on too much bread because the rest of the meal is even better.

Next time I'm in Scottsdale, I will definitely be eating dinner here."	1

My filet was cooked to perfection, and the lobster mac and cheese (off the menu, just ask for it) was absolutely amazing. There was live music in the lounge and the singer was definitely talented, though the music was a touch too loud throughout the restaurant for regular conversation. 

The only part of the evening that didn't live up to my expectations were the drinks. I ordered a bourbon old fashioned, and it was way sweeter than I anticipated. It was also served with chip ice versus large cubes, and a regular maraschino cherry. I might be a bit of a cocktail snob, but I really expected a solid old fashioned at a steakhouse of Mastro's caliber. 

The butter cake! Do NOT skip the butter cake! I have dreams of it."	1

886	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	3	0	4	"We decided to sit in the main dining room since the last time we sat in the bar area (by the piano), we felt we didn't get the kind of attention that Mastro's usually offers.  
We were given a table next to the glass that separates the dining room from the bar.  After about literally 30 seconds,  I could smell garbage/sewage.  Within the line of vision, we could see an open door and  inside a garbage can --so we assumed it was garbage smell.  We told our waitress who said she could change our table and she did.  We were told that it was not garbage --it was coming from  below( sewer).  My thoughts were that if they know the cause, why wasn't Mastro's more proactive in stifling the smell.  After being seated as far away from that table as possible, we noticed that a male manager was assessing the situation.  Five minutes later, a large, sizzling plate of garlic was paraded by a waiter all along the offensive area.  How clever!  Using garlic to mask the sewer smell.  Smart, smart, smart.
And now for the good part of this review.....

Smoked Salmon Appetizer:  Excellent  (Good salmon with capers, onions, cucumbers and toast points)
Bloody Mary:  Excellent
Bread:  Just OK.  It wasn't the kind of bread you find in Paris where it is so delicious you gladly give up the main dish just to continue eating bread.  I don't know what it is about Parisian bread.... Must be the water.
Warm Spinach Salad:  Just OK.  Bacon was overdone so it was bits of hardness.  Lardons are supposed to be rendered but left with enough fattiness that you can still taste the bacon as bacon and not a bacon hardness.  As much as I tried, it was not good enough to even eat half way.
Veal Chop:  Cooked exactly as was requested.  Expertly done.
Asparagus:  Nicely done with garlic and a touch of horseradish...
Chocolate Sin cake:  Nothing could be better... with whipped cream.  Double YUM.  
Thanks to our waitress who was right on point with service."	5
887	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	0	4	"Impeccable service! Our waiter, Bobby, was very nice and took great care of us. 

When we were seated, we were one of only a couple tables. But as the (Monday) evening wore on we were swept up in a tide of patrons, talking and eating and enjoying the good life. 

I had the petit filet, perfectly cooked and delivered on a sizzling plate. Others in my party had the Kansas City strip (deliciously marbled) and the 12oz bone in filet, which I did not try. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes, which were quite unique, and the sautéed spinach. Both sides were way too salty for my taste, and the potatoes were nearly molten after sitting on my hot plate for a minute. In hindsight I wish I had tried the sea bass, but if I had to choose steak again I would go with the KC filet. 

The highlight of the night, even better than the steak if you ask me, was the cheesecake. It was divine, accompanied by what I think was fresh whipped cream and entirely unnecessary. The decaf coffee was ""meh.""

I was not impressed by the entertainment either, a couple young women accompanied by what was essentially karaoke music. There should have been a pianist or something much classier.  

The bill was astronomical but if you are going for experience, this is it."	0

My husband and I commented that it was almost like they had eyes on every table as there was never a moment where our glasses were empty or our food was not at our table. 
Bone-in Filet was told to us as the specialty and I am so glad I listened. The steak was able to cut with only a fork and melted in my mouth. 
Our server was kind enough to share the insider knowledge...you can get half sides and share. As we left our only issue was the lighting being a touch too dark. Otherwise my husband and I both commented this was the best food we had EVER eaten!"	0

Overall experience was great, although maybe the only thing I wasn't crazy about is the dress code: expected to be less casual, more upscale, and less loud, especially for a Monday night, I was expecting to have a quieter dinner with my friend. However this restaurant still deserves a 5-star review. 

They had a table ready for us right away with reservation. Our waitress was Allison and she took great care of us. Good personality, she introduced specials and gave good recommendations. 

My friend and I started with soups: Lobster bisque and French Onion soup. Both a tasteful option to start our meal. My most personal pleasant surprise was the size of portions: starting from soups to dessert, portions are BIG and worth every penny in quantity and taste. The Lobster bisque has giant lobster chunks and the onion soup is delicately baked and blended with cheese and herbs. Great start. 

We were craving seafood so we both got the 10 ounce salmon. Served with an anchovy, caper and olive-based sauce. Good combination. As a side we picked the Gorgonzola mac N cheese, probably the only dish I wouldn't get a second time. A bit insipid for being gorgonzola, but perhaps it was too well blended with other cheeses that it actually lost its strong taste. 

But what I wanted to try more was their desserts. I heard a lot of people eulogizing about their warm butter cake, and they weren't wrong. It's OUT OF THIS WORLD!! Delicious, soft sponge cake served with vanilla ice cream and whipped cream. Try it at least once! 
As said before, portions were so big that we were able to box basically the whole dinner home. 

Not a restaurant you can go in every night, but worth to go back a second time."	0

The shrimp cocktail was really good with the best horse radish and cocktail sauce. The sides were twice baked potato / good, asparagus / okay and creamed corn / good. Dessert was the signature warm butter cake / awesome. The best part however was the server Troy who was knowledgeable, gracious and appropriately attentive. No Scottsdale snobbery and absolutely first class.	0

I made a reservation using open table on yelp and we were in on a busy night. We had a great table and great service that walked us through our first experience at Mastro's.

The range of wines, drinks and cuts of steak they have is amazing... Not to mention the generously portioned sides. If you order a martini they bring out the entire shaker for you!

I went with a new york strip. It was cooked perfectly and we accompanied it with gorgonzola mac n cheese (very good) garlic mashed potatoes, grilled asparagus and sauteed spinach. 

It was an amazing meal capped off by a free warm butter cake on the house because it was our first time.

The piano bar totally fit the bill. The red lighting gave it a more modern flair. I am not into modern as much as my fiancé. He just loved the atmosphere. I enjoy more of a throwback to The Brown Derby. Now...onto the steak, sides, and cocktails! We ordered a 48 ounce porterhouse....whoaaaaa!! We mistakenly asked for rare plus rather than medium rare. Sent it back, and it came back PERFECT! My fiancé loved his peppercorn steak sauce, however, I liked it plain. We also had the huge onion rings and steamed spinach on the side. The onion rings were really awesome...same size as Fleming's with a little more grease and less breading. Totally fattening, but totally delicious! I probably would not pay $12 for a side of steamed spinach again. Best drink....the strawberry mule. The lemon ginger cocktail with the mint had too much mint and not enough ginger. Did not taste the ginger. Ginger lovers beware! We loved Mastro's and Kerel was a top notch waiter....keep him around, Mastro's!!	0

We had sides of creamed spinach, onion rings and au gratin potatoes. For dessert we shared the butter cake and the key lime pie.  I didn't care of the pie, it was too tart for me, but my husband enjoyed it.  The butter cake is a must!  We will definitely return and I highly recommend this restaurant.	4

Kansas city bone-in a MUST for steak... Mouth watering.  Butter cake for dessert...You think you will just go in for a bite, but that isn't going to happen.  It's perfection.	0

We had the lobster mac & cheese to share for a side & the stuffed mushrooms. They give you a lot of food so there's no way one person could finish all that. 

For the main course I had the salmon which was so amazing & melted in my mouth. My boyfriend had the most tender flavorful steak. (Had no time to take pictures cuz It was so delicious I couldn't stop haha)

The waiter & busboy were so friendly & attentive. 
It's very dark in their but the vibe is intimate! 

No complaints here this place is high end & you get what you pay for! Buuuut the most amazing part was desert! Even though you may be full you need to try the buttercream cake!!! Seriously it was heaven! So fresh & hot & with the ice cream it balances out so perfect!

904	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	Been here several times. By far my favorite restaurant. The service is amazing. The ambiance is amazing and the food is the best in the valley. I have yet to find anything wrong with the food after about 20 visits. It's a bit pricey for the average dinner night. I would suggest to come here on a special occasion for you first visit and make your reservation ahead of time (during making the reservation make sure you state what your special occasion is and you well be taken care of extra). As far as food recommendations I would say the filet mignon, crab legs or lobster. The cocktail drinks are very well put together, I would recommend the dream berry if you like cocktails. If there is one restaurant I think everyone should experience this is the place. Much better then Ruth Chris, Flemings, Donovan's and J&G steakhouse. ( this is just my personal opinion)	1

The lady taking reservations did say there is a 50% discount, but when we got our bill, it was only 30% off. We mentioned the difference and management corrected it, so we were happy. But for military to come eat at this expensive 5-star steakhouse for 30% off, that's a huge deal! Loved the food and best part was all the exotic cars in the parking lot.	0

909	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	5	2	4	"Mastro's has a menu that makes choosing anything extremely difficult. I thought I knew what I wanted, until our server came with recommendations/specials and put me back at square one.

I can't say I enjoyed the bone marrow as much as my brother did, but I did enjoy the arugula side salad (he did not- he's not one to eat vegetables. Ever.). 

$35 for lobster mashed potatoes sounds like a bad financial investment. I don't even like mashed potatoes, but DON'T SKIP THIS. Albeit a little on the salty side, it was quite delicious. A pound of lobster on top of creamy mashed potatoes... who knew I'd enjoy this starch so much.

My eyes got even bigger when my brother's bone-in rib-eye was brought to the table. Of course, the ever-so-thoughtful sibling of mine had asked for the order to be split (I think he knew I was going to get into his plate whether he liked it or not). Extremely juicy, well-seasoned steak with a beautiful char. As I put a piece into my mouth followed by a spoonful of mashed potatoes and lobster, I suddenly knew what heaven felt like.

Service was great- server was extremely friendly, funny, and helpful. I just wish I had some self control but I can never resist the bread basket, so we couldn't order more food. Until next time!"	7

911	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	5	We had the bone in ribeye, rack of lamb, heirloom tomato and burrata salad and the wedge salad. The proteins were perfectly cooked with salads beings a nice way to start the meal. We chose the garlic mashed potatoes and the brussel sprouts as sides for the main meal. It all was excellent and exceeded my expectations. After disappointing visits to similar level restaurants in Vegas, Miami and DC we finally struck gold in Scottsdale right in our back yard. The service was prompt personable and professional.  Thank you for the awesome evening.	1
912	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	5	"My first time here was about 3 years ago for my friends 21st birthday and it was amazing. His time I came with my fiancé and again amazing!!! We got the West African prawn (yes just 1 ginormous prawn) for an appetizer to share and it was delicious, though I think it was a special item not on their regular menu. My fiancé got the porter house and that was massive as well, and I got a filet. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection 
The steaks come out on piping hot plates, be careful not to touch them, and the servers will scoop out your chosen sides and they sizzle as they hit the plate. The manager came to our table after taking a few bites to make sure everything was cooked well and it I was proud to say EVERYTHING was perfect! I'm not sure if he was going around to every table or just a few, but it was a nice touch that really made us feel as feel that they were taking care of us and really appreciate us eating here. 
We ordered the butter cake for dessert-their signature dessert item-and it too was delicious, and again huge! We ate so much of our meal though that we couldn't eat all the cake, and they were super nice about boxing it up! We ate it the next day straight out of the fridge, and it's so good cold too!!

915	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"A top must-try steak house!

Oh the perks of dining at restaraunts with a large group.  Basically a food tasting for me.

We started with the seafood tower.  I have rarely ever tasted seafood so fresh or even cold seafood that I thoroughly enjoy eating!  It comes with shrimp, crab legs, and Alaskan king crab.  I was sneaking more and more of the king crab in hopes that nobody would notice I was eating their share.  In addition to the seafood tower we ordered the Sauteed Shrimp (a MUST TRY!)

As entrees a friend and I shared the 12 oz. filet mignon medium rare as well as the twin lobster tails.  I wish I wasn't getting so full at this point as they were both beyond mouth watering!  Our sides included Asparagus, Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi, and Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese.  I have lost my taste for truffle but the Gnocchi is a must try as it is not an intense flavor at all.

My mouth is watering just writing this review.  All in all, you won't be disappointed."	2
916	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"Before I get started on the food, I just need to say sit outside. The patio section is near the bar and has a charming fireplace. There is an impressive wine selection, and the cocktails are really great. I recommend the lemon drop. The presentation is really fun (they use dry ice so it looks like its smoking when it's being served). They also give you about two-two and a half drinks worth of any cocktail when you order one.
Now the food. The chefs at Mastro's are definitely perfectionists. The flavors, preparations, and presentations have been flawless the three times I've eaten there. My boyfriend and I have had the fried calamari, which is great and comes with a really good savory spicy sauce. We've also had the tuna  tartare, which is prepared spicy and served with avocado. The flavor of the tuna is really enhanced and not overwhelmed by seasonings or sauces.
And now the steak. It doesn't matter which one you order, because the quality of the meat is always phenomenal and the chefs prepare it to precisely what temperature you request. The sides are also excellent. We've gotten the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, the king crab gnocchi, and the garlic mashed potatoes. The gnocchi is pricey for a side, but worth EVERY penny. I would even consider getting it as a main dish if I could resist the steak! Despite all the fantastic dishes, SAVE ROOM FOR THE BUTTER CAKE. It is definitely as bad for your health as it sounds, but it is one of the most memorable and delicious desserts I've had in my life. It is definitely something you want to share with 1-3 other people.
I highly recommend Mastro's city hall. Great atmosphere, amazing food and drinks, and the service is wonderful as well. Attentive and very knowledgeable wait staff."	0

We went on a Sunday night and we were seated promptly. The bone in ribeye was as good as I've ever had and the caesar salad and sides were well above average. We had a change of servers after our drinks were served, but other than that everything was perfect, including the nice touch of live music within our view. The butter cake with ice cream topped off a great meal. I would highly recommend this place, and suggest that you make reservations well in advance!

I mean they are on top of it!  Mastro's City Hall Scottsdale I gave five star because this place accommodates many people and the occasions that follow . It's huge inside so if you want a private evening together it's available . So grab your sexy man , your pretty lady and good friends and try it out for yourself . Wait... Before I sign off ,for the four of us after splitting the bill ,we spent 250 a piece that's with my man downing four drinks . 
Don't forget dessert ""Mastro's  signature warm butter cake"" so delicious and mouth watering it was worth the calories !!! Enjoy"	3
929	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	4	5	"I have been hearing about this place forever and finally got to go this weekend and it was awesome.

This is the kind of restaurant where I am happy to spend the money on  great meal with great service. We started with the wedge salad and french onion soup and a couple glasses of wine. The wedge is always so funny to me because its so basic and you don't think its anything special until you eat it and see how awesome the simple food is. The french onion had great flavor throughout. 

For entrees we had the pepper New York strip, rib eye, and bone in filet. We had the green beans, twice baked potato and garlic mash as our sides. Everything was delicious and perfectly cooked. The service was spot on in that we always had our water filled and our cute waitress was attentive enough with out bugging us. 

Unfortunately we didn't have room for dessert although I hear I now need to go back for the butter cake. If I had known that before, I would have made room for dessert. 

Even though I will be eating ramen noodles for breakfast lunch and dinner for the next week after this meal, it was very much worth it and I hope I can go back again soon."	2

Steak is unbelievable (I recommend splitting different steaks if you are eating with multiple people) I mean where else are you going to see 400 degree plates!? Waiters/waitresses are very nice and help you if you need it (remember they are always right). You won't leave satisfied without getting the butter cake I'm serious. It's so beautiful I swear God Blessed it.	0

My husband and I shared a delicious shrimp cocktail and ordered the petite filet which was melt-in-your-mouth perfect. Brussels Sprouts were excellent. But then, I nearly passed out--through NO FAULT of the restaurant. When I became dizzy, the staff stepped up to calm and care for me. Paramedics were called, and I was taken to the ER. If I was going to have an emergency, this was the place to do it. Everyone was so concerned and caring. The manager called the next day to see how I was doing. That being said, I'm disappointed we didn't get to stay to for dinner as the food at Mastro's is superb.	2
932	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	4	"It was a business event. Dinner was good overall. Steak was definitely my favorite - Yes, Mastro's still have it! Ambiance...it's too busy (loudness) for me. I understand it's a steak house, but it's just not for me. 
No complains, but being envious of the business model here. 
Of course, I would come back for steak-dinner events. As for my personal taste, I preferred (great) steak-house like Donavan's or Steak 44 or Capital Grille or Preston's ...a little nicer / classier ambiance. 
Until next time...but at the mean time, Have a blast at Mastro's.

This place  seemed to be on a lot of locals radar.  The place was fantastic!  The atmosphere, the food, the drinks- all top notch.  I shared the 48oz double porterhouse with a friend cooked medium rare plus.  It was perfect- juicy and cooked throughout and amazingly on the table within 10 minutes.  The brussel sprouts and sauteed spinach were also delicious.  Had a very generously poured Manhattan served with a refill in the shaker.  The Key Lime Pie, vanilla butter cake and chocolate sin cake were all amazing as well although I would've been content with the dish of fresh whipped cream that accompanied the desserts.  All in all, a very enjoyable experience.	1

Had bone in filet- unbelievably good for a filter.  Show Stopper.

Sides- Mac and cheese (4.5/5), Lobster Mashed (4/5) Creamed spinach (5/5) Brussels Sprouts (4.5/5)

Dessert- Butter Cake- very original, delicious, problem was I was so filled up from the meal couldnt fully enjoy it

Coffee- Strong and dark.  Just the way I like it.

937	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	2	0	5	"Oh no way, another five star review for Mastros!? Would have never figured! 

I was reluctant to write a review for Mastros because it already has several hundred glowing reviews on it's page. It is not a fickle business where one Yelp review can make or break it's listing, but I felt, after tonight I must.

I have dined at Mastros a few times before, each time exceptional. The food is always top notch (as one could only hope for with the prices) and the service is next to perfect. However, tonight our server went above and beyond. 

As we scrapped the last pieces of perfectly done filets off our plates, and chocked down the last savory bites of Mac and Cheese our waiter came over to check in on us. He could see the defeat in our faces; Stuffed, about to explode, on the verge of a food coma. After briefly chatting with us he found my mom was visiting her college student son from the East Coast. 

He asked if we had room for desert, a groggy ""no"" we both replied. He told my mom that the experience wouldn't be complete without butter cake. I agreed with him, I said ""It really won't, it's part of Mastors culture. It's almost sacrilegious to come here and not try it, at least once."" She looked at me for a second and said ""It does sound good, but I can't I'm just to full."" I looked at her and sighed, agreeing. 

My shook his head and left, a few minutes later he returned with a butter cake in hand. He said he could see the tough decision we had, and didn't want my mother leaving with out a bite. He said ""don't worry about the cost, this one is on me. ""

Now I have been to plenty of restaurants before, and worked in them as well. Usually they will comp a drink, or a split appetizer   if their was something wrong with the meal, or a long wait. But never if everything was perfectly fine. 

So to my waiter I believe your name was Derek, I don't know if you ever see these, or have one of the managers read praises from the night. But these Five stars are for you. Again thank you for the free Butter Cake and overall awesome dinning experience."	2

This place is phenomenal, perfect Filet Mignon, and even if you hate spinach, their Creamed Spinach will convert you into a spinach lover! Of course you should ALWAYS order their Lobster Mashed Potatoes, which may sound like an unusual combination to some, but trust me, you will not regret it. I am a die hard fan of Peter Lugers in New York, and City Hall is the only steakhouse in AZ that even comes close! Try it, you will LOVE it! Worth every cent, and then some!	1

941	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	OMG!  First, the martinis.  From presentation to taste these are superb!  They leave the shaker at your table and so you get a full shaker of martini.  Be sure to plan for that with a designated driver, cause you will be tipsy.  In a perfect kind of way.  Then, on to the meal.  There were 3 of us and we got 2 petite filets and split everything.  We had leftovers, even with the smallest portion on the menu!  We got the Caesar salad (the least memorable part of the meal...I would skip that next time).  Then we got grilled asparagus (oh so perfect! and $11)), the lobster mashed potatos (again, perfect...as they should be for $34!), and the steaks ($39 each).  I have this aversion to blood in my meat, so I ordered well done, which is always a challenge.  The steak they brought out was medium rare...so with many apologies they took it back and the second time it was perfect.  And by perfect I mean no red, yet moist and so tender it was like butter.  I have great appreciation for chefs that can serve meat well done and do it right, and this place delivers.  And they didn't make me feel like an idiot for liking what I like!  Even the busboy was great.  These folks know how to do it right.  Dinner was $150, not including drinks.  We don't care for wine, but their selection looked amazing.	0

I'm not a big fan of red meat but I have had the steak and it was great. I'm more of a seafood person. I've had almost all of their appetizers and they are all great.

We started with the black truffle albacore tuna sushi appetizer at the servers suggestion.  She was right on, this was some of the best sushi we have had, in Phoenix no less! Silky smooth and full of flavor.

For the main course, we both had 18 oz bone in filets, Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese and King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi (the real winner of the bunch).  The steaks were flavorful and cooked to perfection, the Mac n Cheese was very tasty, the Gnocchi was out of this world!! At $30 we were expecting a lot and it delivered big time. 

After we could barely move, we still felt compelled to try the famous butter cake. We were glad we did! Simple and delicious, a real treat.  Our server was as good as the food, she made great suggestions and was very accommodating .  This was one of the if not the best meal we have had and we've been luck enough to eat at some great restaurants over the years.

You name a city where a Mastro's is located and chances are I have dined there, and every single time I know I am going to get a basket of their delicious warm pretzel bread, the seafood tower will be spectacular, my filet cooked to a perfect medium rare, and the lobster mashed potatoes will go down as something I would eat for my last meal on this earth. 
My meal at Mastro's City Hall was no different, delicious food, wonderful cocktails and spectacular service. It's the perfect spot to celebrate that special event or to just go and have a great glass of wine or martini paired with a delicious steak."	8

We started off the meal with some bottles of wine and Seared Ahi Tuna, which was phenomenal. 
Our waiter was wonderful and offered suggestions for our meals. I picked out the 12oz filet. The side dishes are big enough to share and we opted for garlic mashed potatoes, creamed corn and sautéed spinach. Everything was absolutely delicious. 
For dessert we shared Mastro's Signature warm butter cake (everyone raves about it), the creme brûlée and the fresh seasonal berries.
Overall beyond exceptional food, great wait staff and beautiful atmosphere."	0

Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the sides were huge. At least 4 people can eat off of one side. We got the seafood tower, 16oz New York strips, sautéed asparagus, sautéed mushrooms, garlic mashed potatoes, almond green beans and then the butter cake for dessert. It was a ton of food, we had to take half of it home. The butter cake has to be one of my favorite dessert dishes of all time. It was amazing.

The clientele seems to be partly responsible for cultivating this air of Scottsdale snobbery.  Spoiled kids dining out on Dads credit card and driving off with their dates in moms Jaguar; but I digress. Great preparation of our main dishes (NY Strip and Crab Legs respectively). Started with the crab cakes which were awesome. Next we moved on to  Caesar salads, yum, then the main course. For sides, we shared scalloped potatoes and roasted brussels sprouts. Heavenly. The other element I didn't like was the lighting in the dining room. Quite honestly it has the worst lighting of any place of this caliber that I've ever been for dinner. Just dull light that relies on the light from the lounge and the adjoining hallways between the dining room and the bathrooms. In my opinion, it could use table candles or something to give the room some depth.  So for our next visit we'll probably go to another one of their locations but it will be sometime before I have the urge to try it again.	1

The location is great - right next to Scottsdale fashion square which is an amazing shopping destination. The restaurant is swanky and chic and gorgeoussss, and the crowd is definitely dressed to impress!

It was also super bowl weekend, so we naturally didn't get a rezzie, but I usually prefer sitting at the bar anyway, so we walked in with the expectation that we will have to wait for seats.  The place was JAMMING and so packed! The bar was overflowing and every table occupied. But a glass of wine in at the bar, we had committed to waiting for seats rather than going to a different restaurant.  There is also live entertainment at the bar, and a small dance floor for those interested!

The restaurant is perfect for people watching, so we did a fair amount of that while waiting. Also made friends at the bar so we got seats faster than anticipated.  Clutch!  We ordered a bottle of cab after sitting down and then got the following - 22 ounce bone in rib eye, large order of crab cakes, half order of sweet potato fries. Everything was sooooo delicious, including the generous bread basket they offer.  Steak was cooked perfect and served on a hot plate; cakes were meaty and seasoned right, and the fries almost tempura like and sooo addicting.

Mastros was ""awesome"". Bobby was our server and he is fantastic. He explained everything in detail on how the menu works to all the preparations of their very delicious food. Our table started with some Blue Points and Oysters Rockefeller,outstanding. Next, the bone-in filet, rack of lamb and the Prime Rib was our main course along with some garlic mash, asparagus, twice baked and sauté mushrooms.

What won me over was also the fact that I walked in about 20 minutes before they closed, and they still seated us and didn't rush us one bit! The waiter and hostess gave us their recommendations and I ordered exactly that, let me tell you, I was not disappointed at all!!! We got the petite filet and it was to die for! And I had made a special request in the beginning while my bf walked outside for a couple mins, and asked if we could get a dessert with a ""happy anniversary"" note. And they did phenomenal!

962	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	2	5	"Mastro's City Hall was awesome!  The food was absolutely delicious and definitely worth the splurge.  (And for the reviewer who gave them 3 stars because there were no good vegetarian options, umm it's a steakhouse, what were you expecting?!?  Go to Pita Jungle if you want vegan/vegetarian/GF, etc).  

Anyway, we had reservations for 6:30 pm and were seated promptly.  It was our first time there and our server was very helpful in explaining things to us and offering recommendations.  We started off with a midori sour which was great and then started in on our bread basket.  There were four different breads, a flat, crispy parmesan bread, an olive bread stick, a regular or sourdough roll and a pretzel roll.  All were great.  

Then on to dinner...We did not order any appetizers or salads because we wanted to save room for the good stuff.  I ordered the bone in filet in a medium rare plus (so cool you can order between two 'doneness' levels).  It was an absolutely delicious, melt in your mouth, flavorful steak.  The best I've ever had (and I've had fillets at The Keg, Firebirds, Ruth Chris, etc).  My husband ordered the porterhouse and he said it was the best steak he's ever had as well.  We were literally eating it and with every bite talking about how good it was!  We chose three sides to accompany our dinner and honestly it was WAY too much food for us.  We said that next time we went, we'd only get one (although that would be hard to choose which one to get).  We got the asparagus, which was topped with fresh garlic and was cooked tender-crisp, which was perfect.  We also got the gorgonzola mac and cheese which was phenomenal.  We also got the sweet potato fries (I think 5 potatoes were used, there were so many!) and they were very good too.  

Finally, for dessert, we ordered the cherry cobbler and the warm butter cake (both served with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and homemade whipped cream).  Since we were celebrating our 13th wedding anniversary and had stated it when making reservations, they made this really pretty plate with ""Happy 13th Anniversary"" written on it in chocolate and proceeded to congratulate us when they served us dessert, which was a nice gesture.  The cherry cobbler was good (I am not a big cherry fan, that was hubby's choice) and the cobbler part on top was awesome.  Now the warm butter cake was out of this world!  My hubby ditched his cobbler and proceeded to devour my warm butter cake, stating it was the best dessert he'd ever had at a restaurant.  It was delicious, fortunately I was so full, I was happy to share (lucky for him :)).  

We thoroughly enjoyed our visit and were even more surprised the next day when they called us to see how we enjoyed our visit!  Although very pricey, this place treats you right and delivers amazing food.  A wonderful place to celebrate a special event for sure!"	1

When we dine out, I always have him rate each restaurant on a scale of 1-10- most received 6 or 7. Mastro's received 11!  We both ordered rib eyes cooked to perfection; lobster Mac and cheese and cream corn to shared. We also ordered the sea food tower as an appetizer and oh man that was probably one of the coolest deliveries at a restaurant.

We always enjoy getting the bone in steaks as I think it adds so much more flavor to the meat.  All the steaks are prime and I appreciate that.  As a high end steak house, your sides are ordered separately.  They have complimentary valet parking out front, frankly because it is a pain trying to park your own car.  The service we have had there so far is always on par.  Sometimes the dining room can get a little noisy, so be aware of that.	2

We returned to this wonderful restaurant, and it was even better than the first time we went.  Service, Food, and Drinks were all outstanding.  The management team here is amazing.

Original Review:
My girlfriend and I celebrated Valentine's Day here yesterday.
It was terrific.

The food was amazing.  Huge portions so we had an amazing lunch today.
The cocktails were amazing.  
Service by Bobby was amazing.  They even gave us a rose at the end of the night!

The only things that could use improving: 
-Service at the host stand was slow.  Granted they were very busy and their computers crashed, but we arrived for our 6:30 PM reservation and were seated at 6:50 PM.
-I understand wanting to list off specials, but the amount of things that Bobby had to tell us before we could order was ridiculous.  Way too much.
-Oddly long wait times for a few things:  pretzel bread (which was awesome), the dessert, and the to-go boxes.  We actually waited so long for them to box up our leftovers we started to get concerned they accidentally threw it away.

Definitely a great spot for a very special occasion."	3

When told about the specials of the night our waiter mentioned truffle butter. When it came time to order I added truffle butter to my steak. Loved it! However once we received our bill we noticed we were charged $15 for MAYBE a tablespoon of butter. I could not believe it! I would highly suggest advising people the price on all of the ""specials"" of the night. I was extremely upset about it."	0

Everything is right about City Hall. The ambiance, the service, the food. Dear god, the steaks are orgasmic!

I have been in Scottsdale for 10 months, and the food scene here is reminiscent of NY in the 19--- well, no its not reminiscent of any time period of NYC.  
I applaud many of the up and comers and hope they are able to find their footings, but the way to keep your customers is to provide exemplary service. To date I have only found that type of service here at City Hall.

I don't need a hipster server to take a seat in the booth with my date and I amd start pointing to various menu items- um- you are not eating with me!
I don't need a server to pull out crayons and start circling menu items on the place mate cuz, I am NOT 5 years old!

As an adult, I do like having a cocktail at the bar, served by a very professional bartender, having my cocktail brought to the table (and in some cases have the tab transferred). The live music, is on the muzak side, but that kitsch is the only thing that is out of place here. Though, may I say it is fun to sing along in my Wayne Newtown swagger!

Very attentive waitstaff going through the gi-normous offerings of the menu and cautioning to not over order (thanks!) and bringing the extra Atomic Horseraddish to make my face feel like its about to fall off.

The Porterhouse is to die for, Seafood, amongst-- NO-- the freshest I have had in Scottsdale (yes, even fresher that the Salt Cellar) The desserts, well lets say they are heavenly. Hard to eat the molten cake after gorging myself on a ridculous amount of food, but YUMMMM....

But it all comes with a price. I have been lucky to have come here with an ex- boyfriend that loves this place. But now that he is gone, I will have to resort to selling my furure first born child on Craigslist to sate my desire to have another porterhouse at City Hall."	3

The food was outstanding. The mushrooms were cooked perfectly. The steak was juicy, thick and sizzling with flavor.  And the butter cake was out of this world. My wife had cocktails to which our server knew everything about along with the food. All in all, the experience and the food were worth the price.

Came here for my son's birthday, being that I don't live in Scottsdale and from Beverly Hills Ca, I came to visit my son and celebrate a night out with little guy. I knew I couldn't go wrong with Mastro's and wanted to show my son what good service and food is like.
For starters we chose the caprese salad, oysters, and scallops. With the good bread and butter on top of that I'm surprised we made it to the entree....
Then he ordered the rotisserie chicken, and for myself, well if it's Mastro's it's going to be the bone in Ribeye! Everything was delicious but the steak was amazing, nice crisp on the outside and medium rare on the inside, delicious and cooked the way I like it!
I am a BBQ guru and can make a killer Ribeye, Mastro's was perfect!
I remember my son asking me, why did we come here it's very fancy, I responded because it's your birthday and you deserve the best! Being that he turned 14, he sat back and enjoyed it all, especially the complimentary dessert for his birthday. I know Mastro's is part of Mortons corp now but there's no competition hands down!
Thank you for the excellent service Mastro's!"	0
976	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	3	1	4	"Been here a few times now. Definitely fast becoming my favorite steakhouse.

Order the Bone in ANYTHING medium rare with the pepper crust and you won't be disappointed. The lobster mac and cheese is awesome. Not quite as good as Capital Grilles but damn good and def close.

The steaks are amazing. The service is acceptable for sure. The sides are also quite good. The ambiance is very hip and modern professional.

The cost is quite high so be ready for that. Steak runs about $55 and the Lobster mac is I believe $30 but big enough for 3 people to share for sure. Brussel Sprouts are great. 

Parking kinda sucks. So valet, just don't make the mistake of going to the clubs or bars around Scottsdale and leaving your car at Valet here because they close at 10:30pm and you will have to Uber home. We did that and it was quite a shit sandwich of a situation.

I plan to hit this place a couple times a month, its that good. I'll probably alternate between it and Capital Grille. Capital is quieter and id say a bit more ""fancy"". City Hall is quite loud especially in the bar area so be prepared for that. It's def a place to be seen. For me its a place for a good biz meeting and to have a killer steak.

Oh and if you order anything WELL DONE, please go fuck yourself."	2
977	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	1	4	"My porterhouse was too salty to enjoy very much of and I forgot my own tip about ordering one step less cooked than liked because the plate will continue cooking the meat.  It was also a lot hotter than usual so it kept spattering me with hot butter.  I think I prefer the ribeye or the filets.  The ribeye has more flavor and wasn't salted as much.  The filets are thicker so the seasoning evens out better.  

Mushrooms were delicious as always.  The twice baked potato was a bit too salty as well.  Calamari was average, but hardly battered and came with an unappetizing sauce with a thick hardened skin.  That was a disappointing performance for a restaurant at this level that is usually very consistently good.

Cheesecake is different now!  It has a graham crust and comes with a delicious creme fraiche.  The cheesecake is more creamy and dense, though I prefer fluffy.  Still overall it was a decent dessert.

It'll still be one of my favorite restaurants and my go-to for impressing people, but I'm hoping today's dinner isn't a sign of declining standards."	1
978	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	6	2	5	"It's Mastro's for goodness sakes. What's not to love? Valet parking, grand entry and hospitable hostesses are the first to impress. We had reservations for 7pm but showed up a little after six. We figured we enjoy a few drinks at the bar while we wait for our table. Not the case, we were seated right away and had a perfect view of the patio dining area and bar. 
We started with the foie gras which was absolutely delicious! When the Mr and I found out AZ served this dish we both wanted to cry! Lol JK but we truly we're excited and shared an order. The warm apple cinnamon sauce that accompanied the foie gras created a perfect balance between the salty sear and greens of the dish. The lightly toasted white bread allowed the Flavors to open up and not take away from the delectable dish. I also ordered the French onion soup which was also above average, and in keeping with the foie gras, it's rich flavor and cheesy goodness was French-tastic! 
For our main entree we decided to share the 18oz bone-in filet mignon medium rare. So lean, thick and juicy the filet was the perfect cut to share. As for the side dish, well that was a meal in itself! Say it with me, 
"" King Crab leg, black truffle gnocchi "" ahhhhhmazing! 
The service we received was just wonderful and upon speaking with the manager who came to make sure our filet was grilled to our liking, he mentioned that the butter cake was a must to try! Sadly, we saved no room for dessert however, we do have our next menu choices prepared for our return visit. 
Mastro's is a classy, perfect date night choice and one of the better upscale restaurant dining experiences I've had. I tend to stay away from places like this because the food never lives up to the pricing but here I felt we definitely received the best of the best all around. 
So a 5 star "" dark, romantic, perfect mood, perfect food, looking, feeling sexy with live music"" dining experience at Mastro's City Hall."	4

We joined a group of friends here for dinner and they accommodated 10 of us near the bar area.  We were able to enjoy the live music throughout dinner.  

Of course, I had to order my fav dishes here:

Wedge Salad
Bone-In Filet
Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese

The food was phenomenal, just like the other location.  The Wedge Salad is fresh and crisp....very refreshing.  The Bone-In Filet is simply out of this world....the Bone just adds so much flavor to it....yum!  The Gorgonzola Mac 'n Cheese is addicting and is worth the nuclear explosion of calories....I just can't say no to ordering it.

The service is outstanding and we were well taken care of.  Our party of 10 felt like we were at home because we were so comfortable and didn't have to worry about anything all night.  We put away 5 bottles of Wine and the server ensured that we didn't have an empty glass until we were ready.

Tip: The food prices are not cheap here...if you can't fade a large dinner bill, I don't recommend coming here.

Can't wait for the next time!

Inside it's dimly lit and quite loud. The greeting team was very polite and we did not wait more than five minutes to be seated upon our appointed arrival.

Our group of six made a reservation for 700 PM and the hostess sat us in the lounge area of the restaurant immediately in front of a musical trio.

I dined on and sampled the following: 

* 6 oz Filet Mignon
* Crab Cakes
* Scalloped Potatoes
* Gorgonzola Mac n' Cheese
* Basil Hayden's Bourbon

The adage ""you get what you pay for"" is very befitting at Mastro's. My filet was cooked to perfection and the sides were generous and equally worthy of the filet. 

And the band! All told, each of them couldn't have been older than 21, but they were all very talented and their music was a superb complement to our meal and evening.

Would I change anything about the overall experience? Maybe. Seating was a bit cramped and it was clear that the servers were being very careful as they hustled and bustled about.

Service: so friendly and attentive, even when the place was packed! Our waitress offered a bunch of awesome recommendations, and the timing that our drinks/courses were brought out was perfect. We didn't feel rushed at all.

Ambiance: a little loud, but that just adds to the swanky-chic-this-place-is-so-cool vibe. Definitely not a casual place; most people were dressed up, so just be ready for that. They usually have awesome live music.

Drinks: we tried all of the drinks. Wine, gin-and-tonics, manhattans, tequila shots, more wine. (We were celebrating, ok?) All delicious. Definitely have some skilled bartenders.

Extremely dark restaurant...also seem to be the SugarBaby-Sugar Daddy dining restaurant of choice, and I am NOT hatin'!  Fresh delicious veggies, yummy melt in your mouth meat, the Ahi was just ""okay"", and the butter cake is alright but I don't get the big fuss.

We were seated in the tables by the bar, and it was pretty loud and they had a couple singing and playing a guitar. I think it was okay music, but pretty hard to tell as thy seemed to have the speakers jacked up so high you could barely understand what they were playing & singing.  BUT, I still liked it and would def go back!

Oh yeah and two words ""pretzel"" and ""bread""...Soft, warm, and yummy!"	1

Dinner was incredible. My husband and I split a 30oz slab of waygu called a 'tomahawk' It cut like butter. My son's rib-eye was just right. Other party members were extremely happy with their trout and sushi. The family-style sides were excellent. I'm drooling as I write this review... the gorgonzola macaroni and cheese is a must. For dessert, the butter cake. Just get it. Your world will be rocked.	0

It's a traditional steak house w many sides to choose from. They will even allow you to do half portions of the sides so that you can try many! We had the crab cocktail, shared a Caesar salad (the Caesar is huge, plenty to share between two people), the chop ribeye, and multiple sides including garlic mashed, onion rings, sautéed mushrooms, asparagus and mac and cheese. All of it was amazing. 

Here is my tip: if you're getting a salad, share it. Get the half order of sides so you can try multiple.

Everything was perfect. There was no defects with the meal. But all this perfection comes with a hefty price. I don't think I'm shocking the world with that statement. This place definitely goes my the saying, ""You get what you pay for."" The price may be high but worth it in the end.

The service was amazing and we've dined in both the piano room and the main dining area.  Honestly, we loved the piano room better as the songs added to the atmosphere and the main dining area was a bit loud to converse.  If there were any criticisms, it would be that their butter cake desert was a bit over hyped.  Personally, I prefer the butter cake at Frasher's steakhouse better but that's quibbling over minor points.  Come here, drop a ton of money, and leave feeling like Rip Van Winkle was short changed.	0

A gigantic bowl of sweet potato fries.  Enough for 7 to share.  I thoroughly enjoyed the Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  It was rich and delicious. That might as well be my main entree.  The most enjoyable was their signature butter cake.  It's big enough for three people to share.	0
1007	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	0	5	"Where do I start?!? Mastro's is one of my favorite restaurants. I have never had a bad experience here. You can come for any occasion. I've been here for a girls night out, birthdays, bachelorette dinner party's, a romantic dinner with my significant other, and the staff has always been accommodating. 

I recommend you make a reservation unless you plan on just hanging out at the bar. The bar can be very loud so if you plan on having a steady conversation just ask for a table outside of the bar. 

The menu is pretty simple but definitely ask your waiter or waitress any questions you may have or if you want them to give you their suggestions.

I suggest you try the seafood tower as an appetizer. You can basically build your own tower with items like lobster, shrimp, oysters, and crab. For your entree you can't go wrong with any of their steaks! I usually always have a problem ordering a medium cooked steak and it not coming out the way I ordered it. Not at Mastro's! I usually get their sea bass and it is always perfect. Not overcooked like most places. For your sides I recommend the lobster mashed potatoes or the gorgonzola mac and cheese. If your looking for a veggie option the grilled asparagus and creamed spinach are great alternatives. 

Do NOT leave here with out getting dessert! Sometimes I go just for the dessert. Get the butter cake even if you have to take it to go! It's out of this world. If your not into cake then I would recommend the key lime pie. 

Lastly the service. The staff never disappoints. They really do want you to have a great experience so if your not then speak up and I guarantee you they will do something about it."	0
1008	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	14	9	5	"I only demand the best and this place definitely delivers! I dined here under a reservation with my date and I really enjoyed the atmosphere, the food and overall experience. 

When we pulled up (skrrrr) we noticed the line to valet, however the attendants came straight to our vehicle first. So I guess the more luxurious cars are given precedence. That's cool. Because I love favoritism. When I'm on the receiving side, of course. Anyways, the hostesses were very gracious considering we were a tad bit late- but we were sat quickly. 

Our server was very professional and competent with knowledge of the menu. She was also very sweet. She recommended the bone-in ribeye and it was very good! I also feasted on oysters Rockefeller  for an app- a bit too salty but excellent nonetheless- and had a fantastic creme brûlée for dessert. Also had the Gorgonzola macaroni with added lobster and sautéed spinach. Sides are shareable. The drinks are crafted perfectly. I had about 4 lemondrop martinis. The drink is put in a shaker and poured at the table. I thought that was pretty cool.

This restaurant has a very lively scene. If you are seeking a more reserved, austere type of place then I recommend going someplace else. It gets pretty loud, too. I had to speak louder than usual when I was talking to my server. The dining area is dimly lit with sort of a pinkish glow. The bar area is great for socializing. You will find a variety of people that dine here. Couples on date night, older executive businessmen, groups of young men, girls night, athletes. I didn't see any young children. Thank goodness. Having kids screaming and running around is the worst and it takes away from your dining experience. 

Pretty cool steakhouse."	13
1009	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	0	1	4	"The good: same consistency you can expect from a Mastro's steakhouse. Excellent food, and I firmly believe you get what you pay for. 

The bad: will not hesitate to bump TONS of reservations back if a member of the Cardinals, along with a big ass entourage, walks in wanting to eat. No hostess should allow a pregnant woman to stand in high heels waiting over an hour for a reservation she arrived at on time. And no, I wasn't the pregnant woman, but I sure felt badly for her. 

I would say compared to other Mastro's locations I've visited, this one gets bumped down because of the reservation debacle. For us, we had an 8:30pm reservation, but didn't get sat until 9:30pm. Bar was PACKED, and there were no open seats for waiting at all. An hour behind is a lot for a high-end establishment if you ask me.

I would recommend the following: Shrimp cocktail-- VERY large shrimp and REAL horseradish-- fabulous!  Any of the sushi - fresh and great!  Bone in filet- many in our group had filets and they were incredible.  Lobster tails-- this was my entree and I loved it!  Sweet potato mash-- like a dessert! Garlic mash- fabulous!  Steamed broccoli and spinach were great sides.

We picked Mastro's in hopes of a great steak but got so much more. First, super deep wine list and extremely helpful and knowledgeable sommelier. The food was fantastic and --while not Michelin-star creative-- was clearly super high quality, with great attention to detail. Pretzel rolls flown in from Germany --to die for!-- paired with sweet cream butter, amazing sauteed shrimp, outstanding bone-in filet, and butter cake that is without a doubt the best dessert I've ever eaten in my life. Additionally, our server, Cassie, was professional, extremely competent, and just all-around darling. If you're in the mood for a slightly old-school-ish delight, this is 100 percent the place to go. We will absolutely return.	0

However, the 8oz filet I vacuumed down the night we spent at Mastros was by far the best I've ever had. Tender, perfectly seasoned and prepared, etc... It actually made me smile as I was chewing.  Prior to this specimen meat chunk, I'd ordered the sautéed shrimp. I don't know where they catch these things, if they raise them in tanks and feed them nothing but hormones and steroids, or even if they're manufactured,  but these too were the best I've ever tasted.  Being ""a seafood guy"" I've eaten a lot of shrimp over the years but these were unfair to all others tasted up until this moment. They were massive. The seasoning was like old bay meets crack- you didn't know exactly what it was but you needed to keep ingesting, rapidly, because it was so good. I'm not ashamed to admit I actually dumped the remaining sauce onto the steak. Yea, that's right. And I'd have drank the rest if I wasn't in a swanky public hot spot-that's how good it was. Aside from the ridiculous food, the decor/ ambiance was dialed in to the clientele (very cool/ bourgeois). Service was also impeccable. I'd give it a sixth star if I could."	2

I would echo my original review here with Mastro's being a surprisingly good find for a steakhouse. This time I had the bone in filet and it was great from start to a clean bone left in the end. Service was great for a large group coming in on a reservation that did not quite cover all that showed up -- in other words, they were flexible to expand out table to accommodate us quickly and everything still worked out very well.	1

A few of us stumbled in decked out in desert attire from a work event --- we still proudly sat in the main dining room knowing we were going to fire up expense account coinage.

It's a dimly yet pink-ly lit joint...someone really has to make the place feel warmer or nicer. There's also a bathroom attendant --- again, screams clubby.

The food itself is incredible. Had a 33oz chefs choice ribeye (massive, finer marbling). We also got the lobster mashed potatoes (unique and awesome). And to top it off the butter cake is a calorie bomb that is worth every bite. Don't share.

At the end of the day, this is a great steakhouse. Awesome food and service, and prices are what you'd expect for quality. It's just gives off a really really weird vibe that makes me feel like I'm going to get a lap dance post dinner."	1
1027	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	33	20	4	"We went to Mastro's City Hall for my daughter's birthday on a Saturday night. They have valet parking but you can park yourself in the back which isn't too far of a walk. 

The place is fairly dark with the bar all lit up in red with a live band playing. At first our party of nine was seated in the bar area but we couldn't even hear the person next to us. Couldn't even hear our waitress telling about the specials that night either. Band was playing pretty loud. We requested to be moved into the dining room which was more quiet but I know our waitress wasn't too happy to see us move. Seriously it's was a way too loud to enjoy a birthday dinner. 

Anyways, we started off with their bread basket. The pretzel bread was really good. All the other breads were okay but the pretzel bread was the star of the basket. 

 Next, we had the Warm Spinach Salad and the Mastro's House Salad. The warm Spinach salad was actually warm Spinach with bacon and blue cheese. This was really good and I liked it a lot. As for the house salad, it had iceberg lettuce, huge shrimp, and nice big pieces of crab. It was good too but for some reason I really liked the Warm Spinach Salad the best. 

I shared the special of the night with my daughter. We had the Tomahawk which was a 38oz Australian ribeye that had a 12oz bone. Mastro's is known for their bone-in steaks. So we tried it. It was good. Cooked perfectly. Nice and juicy. Didn't think it was great but good. 

We got the sides of lobster mashed potatoes, Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese, roasted Brussel sprouts, and green beans with sliced almonds. The lobster mash was really good with huge chunks of lobster. The Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese was okay. Nothing special to me. Really like the roasted Brussel sprouts and the green beans. Both were cooked perfectly. 

My wife ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and it was moist but a little dry on a few bites (if that makes sense). It was good and my wife enjoyed it. 

My mom ordered the lamb chops. Some of the chops were under cooked but she ate the others and was going to take them home for another time. We told someone to wrap it up but for some reason it never came back. We told our waiter and he went in the back and couldn't find it so he had the kitchen cook up a whole another rack of Lamb to take home. That was pretty cool and nice of them. 

My daughter got a birthday Chocolate Sin cake and we also ordered the Key Lime pie. The chocolate cake was so good and so was the key lime pie. Really good desserts. 

So the service was outstanding. Our server was always watching over us. Our water cups were alway refilled and our plates were taken away appropriately. The food was good but honestly I enjoyed their sister restaurant Mastro's Ocean Club better. As for the ambiance, like I said before the bar area is way too loud. The band was okay not great. We enjoyed the dining room better. One other thing, they have bathroom attendance so bring cash when you go to the restrooms. 

Beside changing our table because of the loudness and losing our leftovers, we enjoyed our meal. It was pretty good. Nice birthday dinner. Enjoy."	38

We also had the shrimp cocktail. They came out thick and cold with a crisp and sharp sauce that gave it a good crunch with each bite. 

For dinner you can't go wrong with the filet. It melts like butter in your mouth. I order it medium rare so the flavor stays in the steak and when cut, the juices leak out the sides."	0

You have to go to Mastro's with a lot to talk about because you're not going to talk about the food. It's great, and consistent, but there's nothing to surprise or delight you. It's overpriced steak and potatoes. Don't get me wrong, the sides are good, the fish is good, wine was great, and the service was excellent. Maybe I just find something offensive about paying $65 for a plain piece of seabass on a plate and another $13 for a potato. I do prefer this Mastro's to other ones I've been to though, we sat out on the patio by the bar and it was the perfect temperature, the sun was setting, and the fireplace was on so quite a beautiful atmosphere.	1

Made sure I was not late for my reservation. Got there and suddenly felt under attired! Asked the valet what he thought and he said ""oh! very casual...no need to worry..."" And so begins my story.
Decided to dine at the bar (my favorite place most of the time) rather than at a table already reserved for us. Dining at the bar in itself was a great decision. 

Ambiance? outdoor fire place for the wintery days and the patio dining. Main Dining Room sexy and well laid out (for those of you from Hawaii, the dining room is similar to Morton's and how Morton's is laid out) and the bar is huge! a rectangle surrounding the bar with at least 40 seats and high tops surrounding the bar area (nice touch). Regardless of where you sit; the table is set for a perfect 5 star meal! 
 
Mastro's house salad- iceberg lettuce and freshly chopped tomatoes with shrimp floating around the salad chased my Bone In Ribeye OMG!  The King Crab and Truffle Gnocchi was absolutely amazing which was broiled but still creamy and the hint of truffle JUST THE RIGHT AMOUNT...

Crème brulee for desert and it was served with a scoop of fresh tossed fruits laced in some sweet liquor and a bowl of FRESH WHIPPED CREAM..... 

Oh! they did give us a basket of breads to chase our bottle of champagne

A perfectly prepared meal and the service? 6 stars! from the valet, to the hostess, to the bartender (our server) and the ladie's room attendant! Who could ask for more service!

My plan is to try the other Mastro's locations in the PHX area.... If I had to rate the PHX City Hall location to the other Mastro's in OC, CA, I'd have to give the thumb's up to PHX City Hall.

Oh! One more thing! Live entertainment; pianist and singer with perfect selection of music to fit the fare!"	14

Steaks were cooked to perfection and the lobster mashed potatoes were absolutely divine. Perfect setting for a romantic dinner. It was pretty loud but it was a Friday night and I can understand why it's so packed; it's amazing!! Fancy but not at all stuffy, expensive but totally worth it. Anyone who doesn't give 5 stars must be crazy. I will definitely return.	0
1038	TkEMlu88OZn9TKZyeY9CJg	1	0	4	"I LOVE when a vendor takes you out for a meal and they made an amazing choice with Mastro's.  We had a private room in back with a cocktail reception in the courtyard.  The atmosphere and service is typical for an upscale steak house.  This place was packed for a Wednesday night so I assume it is wise to make reservations.

The hosts ordered the sides family style and we started with a few shared appetizers.  The steak sashimi was definitely my favorite with a butter-like texture and a delicate seasoning.  The shrimp cocktail was served with dry ice so it looks like it is steaming on the way to your table.  The shrimp were large almost prawn size-like.  However, it wasn't anything extraordinary just some large shrimp with homemade cocktail sauce.

The sides were the asparagus, roasted brussel sprouts, garlic mashed potatoes, and mushrooms for the steak.  I opted for the bone-in filet which was done impeccably.  All the sides met expectations but I have to say I liked the mushrooms the best.  

This is your typical upscale steak house so the expectations are high just like the prices.  However, the signature warm butter cake blew me away.  If you go here get the cake or just come here for dessert and skip the protein."	1

Every meal we have ordered has been superb, and the service is second to none. The seafood tower is a perfect appetizer for a group to share. The steaks are always prepared accurately to order, and the a la carte sides are all wonderful. I've visited many steakhouses, from NYC's Peter Luger to a few of Las Vegas's finest, and City Hall is up there with the best!	0

Beautiful interior with Chihuly glass sculptures, red ambient lightly and overall classy feel. There was a talented trio playing piano, guitar and singing live covers of contemporary music. We found out that there are about 13 Mastros and it's actually owned by Billionaire Dollar Buyer, Tilman Fertitta. 

We started off with an excellent 4 bread selection, I loved their warm pretzel bread the most. Our servers were the best and extremely attentive and friendly. The bone-in filet was cooked perfectly to our taste. The lobster mashed potatoes are a must and the sautéed asparagus was a great addition to the steak. We topped the night off with their famous signature warm butter cake. It was absolutely decadent and the large scoop of ice cream and whipped cream hit the spot!!"	2

The person that dropped our food off (jake? I think) was charming and very knowledgeable about our seafood tower, and our dinner. which was by the way, delicious and was everything we came to expect from such a high end restaurant.

He would even walk around the counter to where you were to hand you your order when it was ready.  I will keep coming back to this place whenever in PHX.

1063	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	0	4	Been here many times, but tonight was different. I was with two others and it was packed. Reservations for 8:45pm. We didn't get sat until almost 10pm. The hostesses were rude or less than apologetic & the waitstaff kept telling us they'd grab us another drink...never did. The bartenders were cordial and the busser; Issac was awesome...he later solved the issue and got us sat...the busser!!! It had been 2 hours, we'd had one drink and we weren't happy at all but we were never rude-just couldn't believe the terrible service we were getting. At this point I'm handing out a 1-star review, however, Issac and our new server Mark were amazing...they knew what our last two hours were like and they took good care of us. They comped a round of drinks...we were going to come back again nonetheless because this experience was a first but they still took care of the round. I think most people would have given this a 1-3 star review but Issac (21 yrs old I might add) and Mark (a seasoned vet) made all the difference. You recovered...you get 4 stars...always room for improvement.	0

Our dinner highlights were the bone in filet, lobster mashed potatoes, shrimp cocktail.  We had the butter cake for desert which I will order everytime that we dine there.  The service was the best!  If we thought about it our waiter took care of it.  Everything came out timed perfectly, finish one course the next one was brought out.  If you want a very special evening I can't thing of a better place!	3
1065	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	0	5	"This place has a great vibe,  because of that I do think I prefer it over Ruth's Chris.  We started with a cocktail, we had mojitos which were really good.  For dinner I had the large cut of filet, ordered it medium well but it came out a little closer to medium but it was really terrific.   My husband had the 22 oz ribeye and really liked it as well.  For sides we split a baked potato and the fantastic creamed spinach.

We didn't do salads or appetizer because we weren't quite hungry enough.  We both had more than a meal leftover to bring home.  Next time I will get the smaller filet.  We had a great server and I am annoyed with myself for not writing this two weeks ago when we went because now I have forgotten his name.

It was my birthday so they served the butter cake, it is definitely worth trying.  The fresh  whipped cream is totally yummy.

We had a really nice time, it was relaxed, fun and the food was really good.  We are looking forward to going back and will probably try the lounge.

Two entrees, two sides, two cocktails and a bottle of wine was about $250.  It was a good value for the quality, service and atmosphere."	1

1073	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	3	2	5	"Came here for Valentine's day with my boyfriend. It was VERY crowded and we were sitting pretty close to the table next to us, but that is to be expected for Valentine's day. I was just happy to get a reservation! This place is pretty in demand for holidays. So I ordered the lobster bisque to start and then for my main course I got the Petit Filet 8oz and my boyfriend ordered the Pepper Steak 12oz. We also got the green beans, mashed potatoes, and gouda mac and cheese and the butter cake for dessert. Let me start by saying we got waaay too much food. The food here is very filling. 

The lobster bisque was one of the best I've had. It had whole lobster in it and the stock was very creamy. I ordered my meat rare and it was sooo good. They didn't overcook it and the meat was so tender and juicy. All the sides were seasoned perfectly even though it was very crowded for Valentine's day. 

Then dessert came. We were pretty full but we felt like we HAD to try the butter cake. BELIEVE ME IT IS WORTH IT! It was so moist and delicious. Topped with delicious berries. yumm. The dinner was pricey, but it was definitely a night I won't forget."	5

Cause if you don't save room for it you will be greatly disappointed.  All I can say is get the butter cake!
Come hungry because the portions are ridiculous!! I don't think we had any idea what we were ordering.  The side dishes are huge!!! We even ordered the small portion and it could have easily fed 3-4 adults...

The service is impeccable an and the atmosphere is fantastic. I believe Mastro's food and service are a cut above Morton's and Ruth's Chris. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone. The price is about $100 a place which takes into account a salad and side dish but worth every penny.	1

Everything they do, from linens, to pork loins in perfection. 

I've had the pleasure of visiting this establishment a few years back in LA and that location didn't disappoint either, however the Arizona location has an ambience that LA did not. 

The steaks are just perfect. Nothing more to say or add. 

The seafood is succulent. For example the seafood tower you can't go wrong with. The shrimp appetizer is so tasty it will leave you thinking about it for days on end.

1092	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	2	5	5	"If I had one meal left on this earth; I would come here. This is our fancy go-to spot for special occasions (anniversaries/birthdays) and we order the exact same food every time. 
Let me break it down for you.

Always start with a martini. The martini's here are like Nectar of the Gods. And once you finish one martini, make sure you have another (and contemplate a driver to take you home).

If you're a raw oyster fan, don't let the MKT price scare you, these little babies are worth their weight in gold.  The cocktail sauce is the bomb, literally, use a whole spoon full of the horseradish and your mouth will be on fire. If you get heartburn later; it's totally worth it. 

You don't need to look at the menu, just order the 12 oz. filet. Don't wimp out by ordering the 6 oz. When that sizzling hot plate of steak is presented, you can almost hear a choir of angels singing. I'm serious... listen for it.  This steak is so juicy and tender you could use a spork to eat it. Everytime I take a bite my husband looks at me like I'm crazy because there is a very audible MMMMMMMmmmmmmmmmm. 

When it comes to sides I only have 3 words.  Lobster. Mashed. Potatoes. I could literally dive into these and swim in the butter. When the waiter asks to spoon some onto my plate my only response is ""Oh, hell yea""... while I try to keep the drooling to a minimum. 

Don't forget your veggies! No steak is complete without a heaping side of sautéed mushrooms. Delivered IN THE PAN! 

Complete your well rounded meal with a serving of butter cake. Seriously, like melt in your mouth sweetness of butter, brown sugar and everything else delicious that you could ever think of in a dessert. Bonus... it's served with an entire plate of whipped cream.  (I'm starting to drool again)

The wait staff always deserves 6 out of 5 starts. They go above and beyond the call of duty.

At this point you're so full you can't breathe and may require assistance (or a wheelbarrow) to get to your car, and your server may just be kind enough to help you with that too!"	5

Being in my mid 20s, I will admit I may not be the most profitable guest, but he even offered the half side of garlic mashed. The steak, served medium to my liking, was the best in the valley. Hands down. Inside was an older crowd and had a bit older feel, but the overall dining experience couldn't have been better. I have high expectations with Mastro's and they have never disappointed.	0

The training is evident and  obviously extensive. There is not a misstep anywhere. The wine glasses are polished. The place setting are aligned like soldiers. These are not subjective observations, but factual. 
  Now, IMHO, the very best shrimp cocktail anywhere is at Mastros. Yeah, surprising at a desert restaurant. Gargantuan U7 shrimp are cold, shinny and snap crisp every time. Add the knock-your-sox-off Atomic horseradish to enhance the experience. Finish with Mastros perfect twenty buck mega Martinis. Yeah, you get the shaker with and other pour. It's really two drinks and a value."	1

Our steaks are always cooked perfectly to our liking. When they have stone crab claws, they are the best I have had outside of Florida. The creamed corn is delicious. I prefer the dining room to the bar area, as the bar can get a little noisy. But if you like high energy and music, the bar can be fun. I like that they had a team of servers, as you always seem to be able to get assistance if needed.  I just wish we could go more often.	0

She looked bored and disinterested. Luckily, one of the managers, Garrett, intervened and helped sort it out. He quickly made up for the hostess behavior by resolving the issue and making us feel welcome. This was our first time dining here and could have just as easily been the last. But thanks to great service (and phenomenal food), I will be back	1
1098	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	3	1	5	I went to this restaurant for my 24th bday celebration ! It was really nice! I loved the ambiance and they allowed me to get my balloons delivered as well as my cake. They had a big a bough fridge to bring it out and cut it and served it to everyone at the table as well as bringing it to the back, boxing it up in plastic wrap and different boxes so it would be easy for us to take home. They were great about taking pictures for us and just over all great service. My one complaint is even though I brought my own cake they usually bring out a free desert if there's a special occasion which I would have still enjoyed. I got the shrimp seafood tower that came out with dried ice on a beautiful display. And I had the gnocchi and salad for my main course and it was plenty of food. This place is obviously very pricey but I believe it's the great device, live music and ambiance I was paying for as well as the great drinks and display of the food. Very good. I will continue coming here on special occasions	5

Early on, the concierge at our resort recommended Mastros Steakhouse as a special place to celebrate our wedding anniversary so we tried it. We absolutely love this restaurant and we make a reservation every time we are in town. The food is always superb and the service is first class. They make you feel welcome and special. 
Last week our entire family of 24 people gathered in Phoenix for a group vacation. We wanted to start the week with a very special meal, so naturally we chose Mastros. Gina was very helpful in making the arrangements ahead of time and found a way to make all of our requests possible. We were given our own private room with an adjoining outdoor terrace. It rained that evening so we weren't able to enjoy the terrace but we had so much fun that no one even noticed. I had requested two servers who we know from our previous visits. One of them was on vacation and unavailable but Jamie came in to work (on her day off!) to take care of us. She and Giuseppe (and all of the staff) provided service that was above and beyond our expectations. Several members of our group eat fairly regularly at fine dining establishments and all said that Mastros provided by far the best food and service they had ever enjoyed. No doubt, it is expensive but it's great value for the money. 
If you are looking for a first class dining experience in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area, give Mastros a call!"	0

1105	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	0	5	Everything was so delicious... We got the chef's cut ribeye, lobster potato salad, and one of the fish. The lobster potato salad had PLENTY of lobster in it. The chef's cut was very flavorful. We asked for it to be sliced so we can share it. It was big enough to fill 2 very heavy eaters. This is the first time we over ordered at an expensive restaurant. The fish was not necessary at all. None the less we finished everything because we were afraid that the meat would go bad if we took it home. It is on the pricy side. And I forgot there was tax Lol... Coming from Oregon that's very annoying!	0
1106	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	2	3	4	"Due to the high prices here, I probably would actually rate this a 3.5 stars. Bumping it up to 4 because there was nothing really wrong with the food or experience-- just pricey. 

It really was a great meal-- but honestly, I find it hard to shell out $100/meal in general unless it's something really extraordinary. 

A group of us ordered some raw oysters-- $3-4/piece. Great & plenty of condiments to make it just how I like it. Fresh.

Shared the tuna tower appetizer-- which was just ok. I was not impressed because the majority of this dish was a cracker crumb bottom. Very little actual tuna proportion wise. 

Bone-in filet cooked medium rare. They got this right on! Delicious. Added a tiny bit of salt to some pieces but otherwise perfect! 

Creamed spinach & snap peas were awesome! Big enough portions for 5-6 people. Snap peas were cooked ever so slightly so that they still had a bit of the raw crunch to them. I liked that, but some people might not prefer it that way. Creamed spinach was what we called ""spinach dip"" because it was so fatty and delicious. 

The part that disappointed me the most was the dessert. Carrot cake was good but I wished they put more cream cheese in the icing. The icing was too sugary. Chocolate cake also lacked a rich chocolate flavor-- it was also a bit too sugary. Butter cake was delicious, but I've had better. 

Service- excellent. No complaints. Very attentive
Ambiance- very romantic. VERY dim lighting-- I personally prefer more light because I like to see my food to enjoy it even more, but this is great for a date."	6

One sip from a water glass and a refill is coming.  Barely a bite is consumed before the manager with the ear piece is asking if ""everything is OK? "" I am willing to pay the outlandish drink and food prices for the quality and atmosphere....a few times a year but, I am always on edge and can't relax because I am being inundated with affirmation requests and offers for another drink when mine is still 1/2 full.  The amount of forks knives and plates used must make the dishwasher cry the sink full of tears.  NY strip is the best there is.

First, this place has a very romantic feel. We were seated in the bar area in a booth. There weren't many people there so it seemed like we had the whole room to ourselves. They also had live music which was a plus! The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I forgot our waiter's name but he was great...he knew when to interrupt and when not to. (I am bad with names!) Now, the food...wow! We had the vegetarian roll to start (I don't eat seafood) and it's big enough for two people and it was delicious! Then my boyfriend had a steak and I had the chicken along with mashed potatoes and sautéed broccoli. My boyfriend absolutely loved his steak! He said this was one of the best steaks that he had in a long time and we have been to other upscale restaurants in the valley. Plus it was a huge steak! Took up the whole plate. My chicken was phenomenal. I only took a couple of bites because I was so full from the assortment of bread and the vegetarian roll that I just couldn't eat all that chicken! There were 4 big pieces of chicken and it was cooked perfectly! We had plenty of left overs. Next is my favorite part...dessert! We had the chocolate pudding cake and it was soooo delicious. It's also big enough for two.

Overall, the atmosphere, the staff, the food and just the overall experience we had was great! This place is definitely pricey but totally worth it! We will be back!

Portions are HUGE- we shared the burrata mozzarella, Cesar salad, filet mignon 12 ounces and small lobster mashed potatoes! For desert we shared cherry crisp- big enough to share for like 6 people!!

Drinks:
We had the lemon drop, Aviation, and the Elder Flower martinis.  Lemon drop was by far the best, highly recommend.

Appetizer:
We had the lobster roll and crab cakes.  Lobster roll was the best, crab cakes were good but nothing innovative here.

Main Course:
We had the surf and turf, the filet was one of the best steaks I""ve had, lobster was good, truffle butter was a nice touch.  Has the bone in Kansas strip, excellent.  And the petit filet, also excellent. 

Sides: Lobster mashed potatoes, au gratin potatoes, sauteed mushrooms.  All excellent.

Dessert: Carrot cake and cherry crisp.  Portions are HUGE!  One will feed at least 4 people.

Having been to many top notch steak houses, I put this in my top three, just a little over priced.  Be prepared to spend!

Don't bother with the ""bone in;"" I really don't think it makes a difference, and especially for the extra $15.  Love the cream spinach.  I felt like the garlic mashed potatoes could have been a lot more garlicky, but then I like it strong.  Servers very attentive but not overly so.

1123	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	1	4	"I have had a great relationship with Mastro's and sent them many many customers as a concierge.  When people looked for fancy and/or great steakhouse I would send them over and they always loved it.  I personally like the place and I'm reviewing and rating based off of one main key thin - the steak that I ordered. (But I will touch up on other parts about my visit)

So the steak was good but it just was not great for me which anyone would expect paying such a high price.  I got the rib-eye and it was a bit too dry for a rib-eye and it did not have the flavor I was hoping for.  Most of the flavoring seemed to come from them buttering it up so much rather than a rich grilled taste I was hoping for. So with that said I personally would simply rather go to Texas RoadHouse for their bone in Rib-Eye for half the cost for the taste that I enjoy.  

The sides.  Mashed potatoes and asparagus for me.  The asparagus was very buttered up too and not cooked enough to my liking but I can't really blame them because I liked my asparagus burnt and I did not specify cooking instructions.  The mashed potatoes was also very buttery like everything else my brother and I ordered.  I do like my mashed potatoes buttery and rich so I actually really liked it.  The side portions are pretty huge and can easily be shared.  

For dinner we were offered their famous popular butter cake.  This thing was huge and just too much for the two of us but guess what...we ended up finishing the whole thing.  It was delicious and probably addicting is the best way to describe it.  

Few other things worth mentioning besides food before I opted out.  There is valet service and the service is good.  The interior is fancy as one would expect and it is more on the quite and dark ambiance.  The middle sections closer to the bar in a bit more bright and lively feeling.

All in all, this restaurant is a great treat for a special night with friends and family and they are very good at accommodating special needs (sent over many many wealthy and high profile guest)  I'm just mainly disappointed with my steak option and perhaps maybe in the future I need to try different options or re-try my rib-eye option. Until that day may come, I'm leaving this as a four star restaurant."	2

Very warm , friendly and had perfect timing checking on us between appetizer, salad, steak and dessert ! They seated us in a corner table which was romantic and cozy. The restaurant was a little on the loud side with the background live music from the bar and the full restaurant. The live music was nice. I didn't expect this on a Tuesday night.  There was a big selection of bread to start with I was careful to not over eat. My lemon drop Martini came with a tiny piece of dry ice in it that made it look very impressive! It was also perfect! I haven't had a decent one in awhile ! I ordered a vegetable roll to begin which I enjoyed. Presentation was nice. I then had the chopped salad  and 6oz fillet. Their fillets were perfect! My husband said it was like having dessert!!  They were excellent!!! The reviews did not exaggerate their steaks are wonderful. We shared his twice baked potato, it was huge! Monica then surprised us with a butter cake with a candle in it and happy anniversary written in chocolate on the edge of the plate! Very nice touch !!  Can't wait to go back.	1

1130	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	1	0	4	We had a very enjoyable dinner at this Mastro's location. We had some confusion on our reservation time on a very busy Saturday, yet the Hostess was able to seat up cordially. We had a wonderful high top table by the piano bar. The singers they had played all the popular Top 40 songs; it was a blast! The seafood tower was amazing and our steaks were some of the best I've had. The hot plates they serve them on ensure a warm piece of meat. The crowd was very great for people watching; tons of older gentleman with young girls! I guess that's Scottsdale for ya.	3
1131	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	5	3	5	"I really like to think that dining at Mastro's is like dining in heaven. I'm lucky enough to be in a family that comes here for special occasions. We just got back from one such occasion. It was glorious.

I'll start with the food. The quality of ingredients is fantastic. Everything is amazingly well prepared. The seafood is always fresh, served in large bowls of ice or gigantic dry-ice laden towers. The salads are, well, salads... But again they're fresh and well executed. Good if you're into that sort of thing. 

Then there's the stars of the show, the entrees and sides. In SAT analogy terms, Best Actor : entree :: Best Supporting Actor : sides. You arguably need both to have a cohesive meal (or movie for that matter). And Mastro's is like Steven Spielberg. Whether you choose a steak, chop, or fish, it'll be cooked to perfection. Steaks come out on the famous 400 degree plates. The lamb chops come portioned in 2 large four chop racks. The chicken is an enormous double breast and could easily serve two (for the kids?). There's a limited fish selection but they generally have 6-8 lbs lobsters and the crab legs are pretty crazy.

There is, however, an extremely large selection of sides. I have had quite a few of them. They're all good. I do prefer sautéed greens (broccoli, asparagus) over steamed. They use garlic. It's wonderful. Also, you wouldn't expect it, but try the the creamed corn, it's delicious.

And oh Holy Jesus I almost forgot to mention the desserts. The warm butter cake is their signature dessert and is quite good. But try the chocolate pudding cake. That little gem is my fav. And really, just order something to put their homemade whipped cream on. It's amazing.

So... yeah, it's expensive, but you get an experience that's phenomenal. Do you need a black napkin because, God forbid, you don't want white lint on your black pants? They'll handle it. Need someone to hand you a towel and turn on the faucet for you in the bathroom? There's a guy for that.

There are a few other steakhouses in Phoenix but they just don't compete. Ruth's Chris may have been cool 20 years ago, but it's kinda run down now. And Morton's food just isn't as good (although they do have soufflés... I'm a sucker for soufflés).

To paraphrase one of my heroes, if you have the means, I highly recommend it."	7

Service - Our Server was good, but not as attentive as I have had before. (Brent is the best btw, but he wasn't working that night) Let me be clear - the worst service here is better than you would get most anywhere else - so this is a total first world problem. My husband had to walk up to someone to ask for a steak knife for me and it took a long while to get a couple of sodas. Lastly, the bill. I know at Village Inn the bill is placed on my table the minute I start eating. At Mastros, I don't want to see it till I am done. Unless I mention that I am in a rush - I don't want to see the bill while I am actively still eating. Out bill was placed in the middle of our eating desert. Didn't like that at all.

Food - Excellent as always. The mushrooms were a little chewy in the Crab Stuffed Mushroom appetizer, but that was all I would say negatively about the food.

One thing I wish they would do is not make it so dark in this place. They provide flashlights so you can see the menu, but I want to see my food too! I couldn't see what was fat and what was meat on my steak, till it was in my mouth. That's just a personal preference I guess.

Still love this place, but mildly disappointed this time."	0

I've eaten at steakhouses all over the country and this is the best steak I've ever had.  The seafood tower is crazy and the desserts are to die for. Bring your gold card but it is sooooo worth it	0

There are certain places out there where you will find yourself regretting spending money on and Mastro's certainly isn't one of them. My steak is always perfectly cooked and the method of cooking them just melts in your mouth. The service is always excellent. Never, too slow never too fast. Everybody should go here at least once in their lifetime.	1

Their scallop app is divine! The sauce they use I sewage is the nectar of the gods. Their Chilean sea bass is always fantastic! And what girl doesn't love their petite filet? Top it off with a chocolate martini which is essentially desert in a glass. Love this place	0

WOW!  The food, ambiance, and service were excellent!

My boyfriend had the ribeye steak with creamed spinach, and we shared the lobster mashed potatoes.  I had the clear lobster roll and the New York pepper steak.

Everything was wonderful, and Mastro's high ranking is well deserved.

It's pricey, but you get value for your dollar here.

From the shrimp cocktail appetizer to the butter cake tower dessert; a hint, it's not on the menu, but our A+ waiter Abram created it for us. Our party had it all from fabulous steaks to seafood it was solid across the board! Our server Abram and the entire service team did a memorable job.	0
1145	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	0	4	Great atmosphere and service. I have the lobster bisque app, which was very good, with some of their pretzel bread which was also great. As an entree I had a 12oz filet, which was definitely one of the best steaks I've had in Phoenix! Every bite was better than the previous. Amazing! The only thing better than the steak was their signature butter cake dessert. OMG, amazing! If only my stomach was bigger, for more. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was that while this kind of restaurant is pricey, as expected, the sides weren't anything to write home about. I had the twice baked potato, I tried the lobster mashed potatoes, and asparagus, and while all were ok, none were worth their premium price. But the apps, steak, and desert more than make me want to go back for round 2!	0

When it comes to this level of steakhouse you need to split hairs to distinguish one from another.  Consequently, I will give a very few other local steakhouses a ""top of the list"" rating.

The atmosphere is very good-beautiful, a little energetic, consummately professional, yet not stiff or ""stuffy"".

The drinks are very well made and the bar is quite efficient.

Then, the seafood tower of selected premium seasonal shellfish is the best in town.

The steaks here are truly world class (wet aged, prime, grain fed) and always perfectly prepared.

I think I have tasted all of the side dishes and all are wonderful, but if you ever crave fries, this is the place to indulge yourself.

I believe they have the best bread basket in the city.

What more could you want in a steakhouse except maybe a great late-night bar scene--?  Well, they have that too.

Final thought:  Mastro's is consistently awesome."	1

1152	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	0	4	I ordered the 22oz ribeye (medium) to share with the garlic mashed potatoes, cream corn, & green beans and almond side dishes. The side dish portions were bigger than expected and even sharing with three other people, we were unable to finish them. I think it's all because of the two baskets of bread that we chomped down before the food was out. The service was great and the food was amazing. I gave it four stars because it was really loud. I found it hard to make conversation with my friends even though they were right across the table. The band was really good though but would prefer it to be a little softer. I will be back!	1

It's definitely a little more grown up here. I'm probably saying this because we always eat in the bar area at city hall. The people watching is better than the airport, wal mart etc lmao. 

Service, food and everything in between was dynamite. We received a nice congrats card from the staff for our anniversary. 

My steak came out a little rare to my liking but they fixed it right up. Great steak, and bomb buttercake. 

If it wasnt so far from home, we would definitely come back often. We'll stick to city hall but same quality of service and food. A++"	4

1158	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	0	5	"This restaurant deserves 10/5 stars. It is a wonderful restaurant to attend for a special occasion, as it is certainly on the pricey side. The final bill for 4 people came out to about $550 (including tip), but oh my goodness was it worth it! 

Drinks:
Elderflower martini - very refreshing! 
Cosmo - they do an awesome presentation with the cosmo by having dry ice in the martini glass so when they pour the actual drink in, it froths over the glass lid. 
Yacht 27 Sangria - also very refreshing, more on the carbonated side then typical sangrias. 
Skinny Diablo - very interesting blend of flavors, the jalapeños were very hot! 
BEX Riesling - a very good sweeter white to pair with dinner 
Trefethen Cab - very smooth and perfect to pair with a steak 
Malbec - A nice fruity blend. Remarked very smooth and good from someone who does not usually like Malbecs. 
Cade Sauvignon Blanc - very nice, not to dry, quite refreshing.

Appetizer:
Raw east coast oysters - I did not eat any of these, but everyone else at my table raved about them (and we are from the east coast) 
Shrimp - the shrimp cocktail was probably some of the best prawns I have ever ordered at a restaurant. They were HUGE. 
They also provide this horseradish, called atomic horseradish, and it certainly gives you a rush because of how spicy it is! 

Main course:
8oz Filet - to date I think this is the best steak I have ever had. It was cooked to perfection. They also offer a style of medium rare plus, for those of us who prefer it a little more done then medium rare, but not quite medium. 
Arctic char - this one was one of the features of the day, although I did not try it, my step dad said it was delicious and scarfed it all down. 
Porterhouse - this kind of steak provides both a New York strip and a filet. This steak was also ginormous but eaten entirely, and also won the award of best steak they had ever eaten. 

Side dishes: 
 Scalloped potatoes - these were really delightful, very cheesey, so if you do not like cheese I would stray away. 
Sautéed asparagus - perfectly cooked in a garlic butter sauce. 

I would also like to highlight the attentiveness and helpfulness of our waiter, Tobias. He had a suggestion for every course and tweaked it around food restrictions. He also was kind enough to bring me two samples of wine before actually picking the type I wanted to order. I would definitely ask for him again when I return."	0

My wife and I shared the wagyu tomahawk ribeye and it had great flavor and was cooked a perfect medium rare. The side dishes were great, appreciated the family style servings, the star of the side dishes was the Mac and cheese and the lobster mashed potatoes. 
For dessert they brought out a butter cake and another dessert for my parents to share which had happy 59th anniversary written in chocolate on the plate, they thoroughly enjoyed it and my dad was asking when we could come back. : )"	0

The service (Mark was our waiter) was excellent and attentive. The atmosphere was comfortable and enjoyable, and the food was superb.

We started with the Seafood tower, which is as fun to look at as it is to eat.  The dry ice accents made it a great conversation piece as well as a lovely appetizer.  The salads were very good as well, but I can truly say I have never had a better steak. I ordered the bone-in filet and the flavor was absolutely remarkable.  I have been to a lot of good steakhouses across the country.  This was a step up from anything I've ever had. the lobster mash is insane. Period. We were so stuffed by the end of the meal that we opted out of the butter cake, instead choosing a creme brulee for the table. This was served with a grapefruit-sized bown of fresh qhipped cream, just for good measure. Delicious all the way around.

Only two (small) negatives come to mind.  Our table ordered a round of decaf coffee to cap the evening. Mine was actually lukewarm.  Of course, the staff quickly rectified that problem with a fresh cup, and steamed it a bit to ensure it was hot. The ample wine list was a bit more expensive than I'm used to, even in other metropolitan areas.  Equivalent selections in Seattle were much less expensive than I found here. That said, you're going to pay a bunch to dine here, and you'll enjoy every minute.  Given my two (albeit minor) issues, I was going to give a 4 star review, but I din't want to leave anyone with the impression that the place was less than exceptional."	2

Tim was our waiter and had great recommendations and was funny, entertaining and attentive but not annoying!!

Their service is unequivocally the best; from the hostess to the server, Duke, and server assistants, very nice, professional, knowledgeable and efficient. The wine list is great. If you can't find something you like, have a martini....they are delish. The food... OHhh the food!!! We had lobster bisque that is to die for, King Crab legs were super yumm. Because we couldn't decide on what entree to have my husband and I shared the Chilean Sea Bass and a New York Strip - Oscar and both were perfect! The steak was buttery and so flavorful and the bass was so rich and savory. One son had the Clear Lobster Roll, the other had crab legs. Very Good!  We finished dinner with a great cup of coffee and cappuccino accompanied with some warm butter cake. We will definitely be dining there again and are looking forward to trying Mastro's Chicago.	0

This is very close to us and a friend recommended we try it - I am glad he did.  We didn't sample much of the food, but the French Onion soup was amazing.  Not crazy about the crab stuffed mushrooms. 

The Martini's were among the best we have ever had.  As well, they kept refreshing them with an ice chilled glass.

Lets forget the music issue and focus on the service which was superb!  There were 4-5 people catering to our needs and they were most attentive. Our server was knowledgeable & talked  me into trying  the bone in steak which was as tasty as he described. The filet was very tender, almost melting in my mouth and perfectly cooked. My husband had a couple glasses of wine which he truly thought was of superior quality.  And then their signature butter cake...  Hmmmmmmm. That's all I have to say about that!!!  Our server found out that it was our anniversary and comped the butter cake!  Now that is what  I call excellent customer service!!!!"	4

For the past year or so, the wife and I have had the luxary of being able to go to dinner every Tuesday night in the Chicagoland area. Some hits, some misses. Click and you will see. Thanksgiving brought us to my parents house in Scottsdale Arizona - on a lazy Friday night, we decided to have yet another Date night. The Scottsdale area is loaded with swanky places to eat ranging from fussy French to Steak. After a lot of Yelp searches, we decided that Mastero's Steakhouse would be our choice. Leveraging OpenTable, I made an online reservation for 6pm. A few hours later, I received a confirmation call from the staff at Mastero's - nice touch.
Tucked away in a strip mall is a standalone building with very cool looking fire sculptures. The staff greeted us with smiles on their faces and referred correctly by last name. A quick drink order later - Gin martini & Manahtten, we quickly felt our worries melt away.
Appetizers: Escargot - Butter, garlic, puff pastry. Simple, straight forward and perfectly prepared. I don't think I can add anymore. Certainly put this on your list of things to eat. Oysters Rockefeller - Very pretty presentation of the oysters on top of rock salt. For those who like oysters, I too would highly recommend this dish. Personally, I tried one from the wife's plate and didn't like it. I just don't like oysters.
Entrée: 16 oz NY Strip - dry aged for a long time, cooked perfectly to Med rare, seasoned very simply with salt. It is easy to mess up a piece of dry aged beef - not this one. 8oz petit fillet - The Filet is one of those cuts which personally I think you should avoid. It normally is devoid of flavor and because of the very low fat content, can be dry. Quite the opposite for this one - juicy, seasoned and cooked quite nice. Roasted Brussel Sprouts - roasted over high heat and finished with butter. Love these things! Lobster Mashed Potatoes - Oh my god! There was so much butter in these potatoes it was actually funny. The lobster complimented the potatoes with elegance and the ""essence"" from the lobster juice was to die for.
Desert: Crème Brulee - another very simple dish with many complexities. The dish was loaded with vanilla bean specs, caramelized sugar on top was thick and perfect. What a way to end a meal.
Atmosphere: Dark, slow (this is good), inviting, warm. Mastero's truly defines the steakhouse atmosphere. I suppose another awesome quality is the various smells which hit you from the left or right as you walk around. More specifically, butter. Oh wow.
Price - Bring lots of $."	4
1170	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	1	0	5	Absolutely the best steak you can find anywhere.  I travel the world extensively and have never come close to the taste of a bone in ribeye at Mastros.	1

The ambiance and decor is great.  The only complaint we had was the music being played was too loud and not very relaxing.  We did say something to the waiter about it, and he said if he could make those kind of decisions, he wouldn't be a waiter!  
The waiter was informative and made some great suggestions, which we took and were glad we did.
We were served a fantastic desert that had Happy Ten year Anniversary written on the plate in chocolate! It was delish and so nice of them to honor us and our special time.  
The only other down side for me was visiting the restroom.  There was an attendant in there, which makes me uncomfortable.  And I did not take my purse with me so was unable to tip and I could see the disappointment on her face.  I don't need any help in the bathroom.  Thank you!
You can't go wrong here.  The steaks were fantastic and everything was taken care of with great service. Almost too much hoovering by the staff!  But we are not used to dining like this.

The service never slacked considering my date...my five year old daughter. She chose the restaurant based on the fact that they served Rack of Lamb and sweet potato fries. She specifically asked for a ""fancy"" restaurant and Mastros delivered in ever way! They completely catered to us as normal and went above and beyond playing along with letting her ""pay""!

I don't eat steak often but I have to say the Fillet was outstanding and cooked perfectly.  The sides were great, spinach, broccoli, and Lobster Mash.

The breakdown is - over priced wine, great starter soups (huge!). Great steaks. Terrible overcooked asparagus and the twice baked potato was a huge ""cheese whizzy"" disappointment. The live music was very good, and the dessert was AMAZING (warm butter cake).

Steaks and fish and all the sides are so delicious.  It's almost always pretty busy so you know they are a quality place.  It's relatively near us in North Scottsdale so we go there several times a year.  I have kids so don't visit the bar area, but that looks really nice too - for relaxing drinks and usually live music.  Great atmosphere and a little dressy - as much as you want it to be.

Be warned that reading this might put you into a food coma. The food here is delectable and delicious. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu but just be warned that it's very easy to fill up on the pretzel bread and salads before your entree event comes out! My favorite salad is the Mastro's House Salad and Wedge Salad. Both are tasty and both are very filling so be prepared that you might be stuffed! As for entrees, of course the steak is the best way to go but only if you are ok with getting it cooked medium well or less. It practically melts in you mouth! Other musts on this menu are the Gorgonzola Mac N Cheese, Lobster Mashed Potatoes and Warm Buttery Cake. If you only come here and order the sides and dessert, you will leave a happy person!

Service here is always excellent and it's always a lively, yet romantic atmosphere. The bill will add up, so be prepared to pay for this experience but if you are looking for a dinner to celebrate a special occasion, make a reservation here!"	17

The process was super streamlined and easy to use. The food was tasty (yes, even to-go). Tried the bone in filet, cream corn, wedge salad and garlic mashed potatoes. Steak was cooked perfectly, juicy and flavorful. The sides were good but nothing to write home about. We would probably do this again, in the future, and found the price to be pretty reasonable. Overall, a good experience!	1

I've been to this location once before years ago but never Yelped about it and it was wonderful to go back. I had the unbelievable New York Pepper Steak there and my wife the Scottish Salmon. We had the garlic mashed potatoes and also the fresh broccoli as our sides. Our water Jerry really took good care of us from our beverages of choice to compliment our meals and my wife's salad was also very good. I ordered the shrimp cocktail and thankfully Jerry warned me about the straight up nosebleed horseradish! Jerry was just amazing. If you ever go to Mastro's be sure to ask for him, actually anyone there will do well, we just loved Jerry to pieces for everything. He was very down to earth and attentive. It was an extraordinary culinary experience and thanks to him, we had a celebration of flavors wetting our pallets. 

Sadly though the night had to carry on and we were blessed with Matro's amazing Butter Cake after our entrees. I'm glad that we booked for 5pm because around 545 it really started to pack in. We felt we had the entire restaurant to ourselves for a while and just savored how fast the first year of our marriage went. My steak melted in my mouth and my wife's salmon was perfect. Oh and the shrimp cocktail? Well those prawns were by no means thin! LOL! They were a meal unto themselves! I can't say enough about this place. 

We left happy and content and were more than happy to leave Jerry a substantial tip because he made us feel like family. The food could have been absolutely horrible, but because of this good man, he would have made a negative meal experience disappear. Yes, he was that good! He actually said goodbye and thanked us for being his guests. Classy. On Spot. Positive. Thank you so much Jerry and Mastro's we'll be back again another day soon! You made our Anniversary memorable!"	0

We enjoyed, once again, a fabulous dinner this evening. Celebrating our anniversary combined with a birthday, Jaime again,
did not miss a beat! Our dinner was very enjoyable, with Salmon, and bone-in ribeye,
baked potato, tomato/onion salad, and mushrooms. The steak was juicy, and very flavorable, as was the Salmon.
Jaime then brought us chocolate butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream, whipping cream.
What a great experience!
This is our favorite spot in the valley.

Walking by the dessert room alone will set your dopamine receptors into hyper drive. Mastro's Sunday Brunch is a must for anyone who resides in or is visiting Scottsdale. This was hands down the best overall meal I have ever experienced. I would pay the $75 for just their belgian waffles; they are that good! The server mentioned that the brunch is seasonal and that they haven't decided if they will do it again next year. It would be a tragedy to the world if they do not bring this back next year. If you've been to Mastro's for dinner, but not their brunch, you have to go at least once....so that way you will go again, and again, and again! I work in the hospitality industry and generally work weekends, but I have made it a point to request a couple extra Sundays off! :)	0

I have eaten at most of the top steak houses in the country and none come close to Mastro's in taste and quality.  Plus, the atmosphere is perfect!  Add to that the top notch service and you have a perfect 5 stars!  
I have eaten multiple times at this Mastro's.  Never once have I had a bad experience and the food is always perfect!  Although I also like Mastro's City Hall and Mastro's Ocean Club, somehow the steak always tastes just a little better at this Matro's location.  Is it just me?
Do yourself a favor... Take your favorite guest to this establishment.  If you have a boss to impress ... here it is, made to order!  Trying to wow a date?  Look no further.

For the last 2 or 3 years we started a tradition where weed utilize a private room. We get privacy we're able to talk as much as we want and usually there's a TV in it so we can watch college football considering it's Labor Day weekend and the season just started.

The service was wonderful. The guys who took care of us did a great job. Because of the amount of people we had we were able to create a menu it was $115 per person. Off of that mean you I got the 18 Oz New York strip steak along with the various assortment of sides and appetizers and desserts.

I asked for my steak to be cooked medium rare. This steak did make my top five of all time. Perfect crust and perfectly cooked. It was delicious. We all had creamed corn,  asparagus, grilled brussel sprouts, macaroni and cheese. The butter cake with vanilla ice cream at the end made the night perfect. If you are ever in this area please go check them out. I'll also say the two-way mirror was a nice touch. Watching the ships prepare the food and being able to see the various things they offer made you want to come back for more."	0

We were seated immediately, ordered chopped salad, rack of lamb, sautéed spinach and creme brûlée along with a very reasonably priced bottle of Zinfandel.  The waiter inadvertently omitted my husbands entree and apologized profusely but since we had ordered alike he brought a hot  plate and suggested we split mine while they prepared his.  This could have been a catastrophe but was not as they quickly brought his and it did not delay our dining.  But they still immediately comped his entree.  Everyone loved the food and the elegant setting and we cannot wait to return.	0

But, we returned for a makeup dinner and it was our best ever. Roman helped turn our frown upside down. And Drew our server was exactly what you'd expect at a steakhouse of Mastro's caliber. 
Cocktail & wine perfect. Shrimp cocktail perfect (Huge shrimp & great horseradish sauce!). Filet incredible, best steak I've ever had. And the buttercake was amazing as usual. 
Mastro's met and surpassed our expectations. Because we were treated so well we'll be back again and again for sure. Ask for Drew the next time you're there!

The food was awesome as always, especially the twin lobster tails.  All in all, the best part of the night by far was Frank talking to us about his time playing professional golf as we told him two of my buddies are currently playing college golf, and had other great conversations throughout the night.	0

There was certainly nothing to complain about the food however the ratio to expense and quality was certainly unbalanced.

Our party of four enjoyed a family style dinner of Lobster Bisque soup, Chopped Salad, and a 48 ounce Double Cut Porterhouse.  For sides we chose a Lobster Mashed Potato and Creamed Corn. Everything was truly superior including the service. After dinner we headed into the lounge and enjoyed a nightcap while we listened to a talented duo of keyboards and vocals.

The four of us, two adults and two kids ages 11 and 6 all ordered filet mignon from the menu. The steaks were all perfectly cooked to order and the flavor and quality of the meat was second to none. The side dishes and appetizers were also quality. Yes, the prices are high, but in this day and age in order to get a top quality steak it seems one needs to pay top prices. I have tried other places such as Capitol Grill and by far Mastro's is better than the rest. I highly recommend this restaurant for top quality meat if you can afford the check. Plan on spending at least $60 per head and that is without drinks. The only negative I found was that the restaurant is quite loud so it was hard to hear my wife and kids as we tried to speak across the table to one another.  Enjoy!!!	0
1209	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	7	1	5	"This place is easily one of my favorite Steakhouses in Arizona.  They blow me away every time I visit.  I'm a creature of habit when I find a great Steakhouse, so I tend to order the same thing every time.  Here's what I order here:

Wedge Salad w/Blue Cheese Dressing & Crumbles
12 oz Bone-In Filet, $38
Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese, $12

The Wedge Salad is a big portion and I have to be careful every time I order it not to get full.  I usually split it with The Better Half.  I wish they had a 1/2 order available.

The Bone-in Filet is simply magnificent.  It's juicy and full of flavor.  The right amount of marbling and the bone gives this Steak unbelievable flavor....my mouth is watering as I'm typing this.

The Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese is a big portion for a side dish...plan to share or take home.  It's very creamy and rich....delicious.  It compliments the Filet well.

The servers here are top notch and always go the extra mile to ensure you have a good time.  If it wasn't so far from civilization (it's in Pinnacle Peak), we'd come here more often.

PS - this is not a cheap restaurant.  If you can't afford to spend the money, don't come here....you'll be disappointed.

With that said I love Mastros. As soon as you walk in the mood is set with the impeccably decorated interior. The service is as good as you'd expect for a place like this as well. The food is great but if you're going to come here you have to grab a steak. The sides are pretty good and what you'd expect from a steakhouse but it's one of the best steaks I've had.

Their seafood restaurant didn't have any availability, so we went here and I am SO glad we did. First, I hate to admit that I had never heard of Mastro's. I have hit all of the other national chain steakhouses...but never Mastro's. I had the bone-in filet and while I have had a bone-in filet before, this one was the best steak I ever remember having.

My favourite item on the menu...?...Actually it's not a streak and anything but. The dish that wins my most acclaim is the herb roasted chicken. The tenderness is a melt in your mouth experience....and it's crust and crispness is just legendary....on top of that it is perfectly browned and juicy. Couple the roasted chicken with a side of creamed spinach and you've got a winning combination that will leave your taste buds moaning the rest of the evening.

Our waiter in the bar was very gregarious and I wish I could remember his name because he is defiantly the reason they get 5 stars from me. We had a great bottle of wine, a red blend and started off with the lobster bisque soup. Plenty of lobster and filling. Then had the bone in filet. Delicious!

Well, pretty much from start to finish I was surprised. A good beer, a great steak (from the special menu of the day), good service, overall a wonderful experience that I would certainly go back to. Also, the menu was wide enough to make everyone at the table happy -- and this included some that would not find a good home at most traditional steakhouses that at least I know of."	2

Upon arrival the Hostess asked about the Birthday and picked up a red rose and handed it to my wife. Great touch!  Throughout the evening the service was 5 star all the way. My wife finished most of her dinner and pushed the plate toward the end of our table, and within a minute the restaurant Manager stopped by to ensure everything was alright. Puzzled, we asked why?  He said it usually is not a good sign when someone pushes a half full plate to the side. We had a laugh and ensured him that all was good, we wanted a box to take it home. Had to leave room for dessert of course. The warm Butter Cake is so good. We even received a follow up call the next day to thank us for choosing Mastro's.

I got a small potion of the lobster mashed potatoes $26 instead of $40 still good portion to share for two people! The mashed potatoes are great because of the large chunks of lobster but once you eat those pieces the potatoes are average. I had the butter cake for $16 it comes drizzled in raspberry sauce with fruit and homemade whip cream! Honestly, one of the best deserts I've ever had. I was in a rush to catch a flight home but had to eat here before leaving. My server was super attentive and friendly got me in and out perfect timing!

The things I would AVOID are the Lobster Mashed potatoes and the lobster sushi roll both of which are boring.   But lobster can be boring without sticking it in butter.  But the other veggies are great. Also, if it's your birthday and you don't specify which desert you want,  they bring you a boring dry chocolate cake that you pay for.	0
1234	M-lS6AzGfoVB76at4c0Z7A	0	0	5	WOW!!  Very funky, eclectic atmosphere.  You step into something that looks like it came from the 40's.  Dark, rich, classy.  Everything you read in previous reviews is true.  I ordered a Cosmo that was ok..too much orange flavor but the presentation was crazy.  Dry ice that made it bubbly over.  Our waiter, Tobias was wonderful. Very knowledgeable about the restaurant, wine, steaks, menu.  He was funny and friendly.  They really treat you like someone special.  I had the 12oz. Bone in filet and my husband the 16oz.  One of the best steaks ever!  Unbelievable flavor.  Delicious Brussel sprouts and green beans as sides.  Because they knew it was our anniversary they comped us a butter cake.  You're so stuffed but you do manage to shove a few bites of the decadent cake and whipped cream down your mouth!!!  Super dining experience..wish they had this restaurant in Northern California.  Highly recommend.	0

Sassi is a huge venue with multiple rooms, which can be rented for catered events, and the food and wine were delightful. At night the whole venue is softly lit with candles and fire pits.  The walls are painted soft colors of Tuscany, with ironwork chandeliers and sconces. Highly recommend for a romantic dinner or group gathering.	0

The ambiance is top-notch, and the building itself is beautiful.  I would sit outside near sunset in nice weather if possible.  Gorgeous views.

The food, wine, and service is also top-notch.  I've eaten here several times and each time the food blew us away, and the waitstaff is very knowledgable and enjoyable to talk to.  All the plates just seem to be perfect.  Whether we had the small plate of nuts for an appetizer, or a beef or fish main course, or the desert, it all was presented beautifully and was delicious.  This is probably the best restaurant overall that I've been to, and I've been to a lot!"	0
1238	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	3	1	5	"Without a doubt one of the top five memorable meals that I have had and probably top 3 in Arizona. 

Driving up to the location which is across the street from the former Pinnacle Peak Patio location which provides spectacular views of the city. 

We decided to dine here to celebrate my wife's birthday and what a good choice it was. 

Made reservations on Open Table and was called back the day before to confirm reservations, so I  asked the person what they would recommend as far as a sunset dinner with a 600pm reservation and the sunset at 615pm. She asked if we wanted to sit inside or outside and I asked her to recommend since this was out first time. She was leaning toward the patio and assured me she would take care of us.

As we walked up to Sassi the circular driveway was spectacular and the walkway leading to the front entry was even more breathtaking. As you walk in there is a separate building that a wedding reception was taking place which I heard can accommodate up to 150 people. As you walk past that you finally come to the front doors which are spectacular and you know your dining experience is to begin.

We were greeted at the front and taken to our table which was through a long hallway and outside to the patio. We were seated in which I considered the best spot on the patio on the corner overlooking Pinnacle Peak Mountain. So yes we were taken care of.

Our waiter Tony was excellent as he explained the many options of eating family style and then ordering the 2nd Main Course individually. We always had Tiny there or someone else to fill out glasses and make sure we were taken care of.

We started out with the Organic Radishes while we decided what we wanted to order, then ordered to share the Brushetta  (Tomato, Prochetta and Bean), Potatoes, Ricotta Gnocchi, Orcchiettta with Sassi Sausage, Wood Grilled Octopus and then they brought out their fresh baked goods in a basket.

My favorite was the Orcchiettta with home made Sassi Sausage, known as pig ear pasta, but the sausage was one of the best I have had and I am a huge fan of sausage. The Wood Grilled Octopus was good but was so hyped up that I preferred the Orcchiettta with Sausage a little more.

For our 2nd entrée we ordered the New York Strip, Wood Grilled Veal Chops and Wood Oven Roasted Quail. We all shared with each other and all the entrées were excellent and we'll prepared, and the presentation was impressive. 

The New York Strip was a generous portion and cooked perfectly while the Wood Oven Roasted Quail was excellent and tender. The Wood Grilled Veal Chops were soft and tender and along with the mushroom sauce was incredible. 

We finished our meal with the canolis that were a chocolate chip and 2 other flavors. Good tasting but not the best I have had.

The building is impressive as there are many different rooms or open dining area along with the expansive patio area.

Loved everything about the restaurant and the attention to detail that is put into the restaurant. 

A special touch was how the management came around to ask us if everything was okay multiple times by different people. 

Absolutely a memorable dining experience and a great way to celebrate a special occasion. 

Would like to come back, just need to win the lottery to pay for the next meal :)

1239	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	Th atmosphere at Sassi is second to none. The food lives up to expectations very nicely. The caprese was one of the best I've ever had. All of our entrees were cooked to perfection. Will be back to Sassi soon. See you so soon, Sassi!	0
1240	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	Incredible Restaurant! We recently bought a home in the area and decided to try Sassi for my birthday. As we approached the restaurant the lights were twinkling, the fountain flowing and the hostess greeted us with a warm smile. The ambience is beautiful. We felt like we were back in italy dining at an Italian Villa. It is one of the few restaurants that took the time in creating perfect lighting. It's rooms are dimly light, but have down lights over each plate so you can read the menu and enjoy the visual of the food. Ambience, service and food were all 5 stars. I can't say enough wonderful things about Sassi!	0

1242	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	1	4	"Very nice restaurant! The decor was very comfortable. Staff was awesome. They did a great job and you never knew they were there. Octopus and Caprese to start. Both out of this world. I had orechetti that was fabulous. Wife tried ricotta gnocchi. I loved it and she liked it but found it a little rich. Cannoli's awesome as well. I would have went 5 stars if not for one thing.
Hostess takes us to our table and we walk directly outside and not asked if it was ok or not. I went with it because it was a nice patio area and it didn't feel too hot. By the end of our meal I was hotter than s&/t and watched other people around us fight off bugs the size of black birds. I will never sit outside again! If I would have spoke up and asked to stay inside we would have had a perfect evening."	0
1243	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	Took my wife here for our anniversary dinner, this place is top notch all around. Caprese was the best I've ever had and the meatballs were great as well. Service was first class and the ambiance was great. We ordered the salmon and the ny strip, both were very good. Would love to make it back here soon.	0
1244	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	Best grilled octopus I've ever tasted, soft and tender. The views are amazing, especially at sunset. Also try the limoncello sampler. Mine had kumquat, lemon and mandarin. The $3 bruschetta were lovely. We also had the ricotta, fig goat cheese salad, corn ravioli and gnocchi. Everything was delicious and carefully prepared. Similar to food I had when I was in Italy visiting family. Our waitress was in training while her mentor stood in the shadows ready to jump in at any moment! Both were very knowledgeable and didn't bug us too much. For the two of us it was about $150 with tip. Definitely a great place to celebrate that special occasion.	0
1245	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	0	4	"We came here for my birthday dinner and had a wonderful time. The venue is large and would be perfect for a wedding or a nice party. The style is Tuscan and there are large fireplaces in some dining rooms that are beautiful and help keep you warm. 

The menu is well organized by course. The snack course is first and accompanies your cocktail of choice. We tried the roasted nuts and loved them. I had two slices of cucumber goat cheese bruschetta and they were soooo good! I only needed one, though, they were quite large but i ate both! 

We are vegetarian and the menu was easy to follow and was accommodating. I had the caprese salad. It was $22 and not worth it. The mozzarella portion was generous but not the best I have had. Also - no balsamic! I thought that was a staple. Apparently not.  

The gnocchi was my main course and it was delicious. It made up for the caprese. The sauce tastes fresh and the pasta pillows were soft and perfect. 

I had the pear brown butter cake for dessert and it was fabulous! Next time I will substitute vanilla gelato for anise... Black licorice is disgusting. 

Our waiter was Todd and he did a great job recommending dishes and explaining which could be made vegetarian for us. 

We will be back! Thank you Sassi for a great birthday dinner!"	0

1248	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	Went to Sassi for our anniversary and it did not disappoint.  The ambiance and decor are very romantic.   We were promptly seated indoors facing the open patio.  A cool breeze rolled in keeping us comfortable.  Our server, Krista, was exceptional.  She took time to explain the menu and provide recommendations.  She was very attentive and polite, but did not hover.  Needless to say, she made some excellent recommendations.  We sat for several hours as the courses arrived and enjoyed the relaxed pace and our time together as the food arrived.  It was all excellent - but the Duck Liver Budino, Orecchiette, and the Pork Chop Milanese were most memorable.  Make sure to save room for the Apple Cake with Salted Caramel Gelato.  All in all a perfect dining experience.  We'll be sure to be back soon.	0
1249	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	What a nice surprise to find the gem of an authentic Italian restaurant way up the the hills of north East Scottsdale.  I brought my family of 5 on a spring break Tuesday night with a last minute reservation.  We were seated beneath the stars on an outdoor patio at the base of pinnacle peak.  Gorgeous evening!  Appetizers were buffalo mozzarella imported from italy and grilled octopus. The mozzarella was a little gamy and it seemed old, not creamy. The octopus however, was top notch!  Next came the pasta course which I found tremendous, gnocchi was the stand out.  The main course of whole roasted, stuffed Branzini was sublime.   The real perk at this place is the wine list which had an incredible selection of unique italian varietals with only minimal mark up.	0
1250	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	"A few friends and I have committed to trying a new place once a month or so.  This was our first field trip and it was a worthy destination.  

Up in the hills of north-north Scottsdale, Sassi is in the shadow of the Pinnacle Peak mountains.  The property itself is gorgeous and very much feels like a wedding venue (and it apparently is!).  

Enormous leather chairs and distinctive rooms give this place a very lodge-y homey feel.  

Drinks were fantastic.  If you're a fan of both tart and sweet, you can't go wrong with the limoncello martini.  The table shared a few apps...  the octopus (which I didn't have but am told it was excellent), the caprese salad and the meatballs.  

The caprese salad is possibly one of the best I've ever had.  Moist, flavorful mozzarella atop seasoned heirloom tomatoes, basil and fancy pants olive oil - yes, please.  

Although not touted as one of their ""specialties,"" my scallops were amazing.  Again, quite possibly some of the best scallops I've ever had. There was a delicate lemon flavor and when combined with the peppery greens, it was an intense and unique flavor combination.  

This is a destination meal.  Don't ""stop by"" for quick before a show or other engagement.  Make this your main event.  

There was one aspect of evening that was slightly off putting.  Our reservations indicated that we had one dairy-sensitive and one gluten-free person.  The menus were clearly designed to address food allergies and that was wonderful.  However, gregarious and friendly as our server was, he did not have a good grasp on what ""gluten free"" meant.  I think servers have a responsibility to educate themselves (or be educated) about what specific food allergies encompass so that they may make accurate menu suggestions."	0
1251	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	Excellent service and the best insulata cyprese I ever ate. A wonderful atmosphere made it a romantic setting.	0
1252	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	I recently spent our 44th anniversary with a night at Sassi and had a very good meal--not a 5 star meal but very good.  The service is great, atmosphere is wonderful and the staff is very friendly.  This is probably the 10th time for us for dinner here and we have loved it each time and would highly recommend this for a special night out.	1
1253	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	1	5	This place is magnificent. Although it may take you a while to get up there, That sort of adds to how majestic the experience is. You are quite literally sitting on a mountain while you dine. Of course, I came here in December when it was chilly but I can only imagine how wonderful it is to sit outside in the nice temperature. The service is incredible, even took us outside and walked us around and showed us the views and offered to take photos (see attached). We had everything. Appetizers, bread and butter, full meal, and dessert. Oh... And of course - cocktails. Everything was divine. It was a little chilly in the restaurant so I couldn't really wear the dress I was looking forward to wearing, so consider that. On the day that we went there there was also a wedding reception right next-door. So keep that in mind ladies ;-)	1
1254	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	Between Sassi and very few other restaurants in AZ that I won't plug now, the bar is set so high.  Sassi is class, food, and ambiance at its highest.  The location itself, set as an Italian Farm House in Pinnacle Peak is just priceless and beautiful.  The food....I strongly just doing a tasting course (cheaper in the summer)...is just phenomenal.  I would go here time and time again it finances allowed.  Sassi is an incredible treasure.	1
1255	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	"So went here on a Friday night for my pre-birthday a week early as my Dad and Stepmom were in town to celebrate.  Went for a few drinks.  The location is right alongside Pinnacle Peak and if you are able to grab a table outside, amazing sunset viewing.

Inside the bar area is very dark and they had a band setup (well 2 women singing).  Curiously, even though we are in high season, there wasn't many people there.  The place is pretty huge and they host weddings and other private events there, but none this night.  

I'd definitely say this is a great spot if you want to impress a date for sure.  Romantic and the decor is off the charts.  It's old school Italian and you feel like you are in a Roman garden on the outside with waterfalls/decor/ambiance is spectacular.

Didn't have any of the food.  They only had like 3-4 types of red wine by the glass which I found annoying. 

Overall I'd go back and check it out."	0
1256	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	Beautiful restaurant & view, a bit dark inside, great food, & good service. For such a nice restaurant, it seemed really strange that they served some desserts in mason jars, which are, from my sense, far from classy & more something typical to see in a young, hipster, casual restaurant.  Lovely appetizers, though I wish they offered Melanzane alla Parmigiana. I also wish they offered tiramisu on the dessert menu. It seems like they definitely poured a great deal of money into making this giant facility appear as close to an Italian villa as possible. It's pretty.	0
1257	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	This was my first time visiting Sassi and I can say with confidence I will be coming back! The atmosphere was cozy and comfortable and the food was even better.

All of his suggestions on wine and food were outstanding so if you try out Sassi request Zane!	0

They grilled octopus on the appetizer list is something you should not pass on. Our waiter also did a balsamic, olive oil plate with parmesan finely grated down middle of plate to dip the wonderful bread in! 

Our waiter tonight was one of the best I've ever experienced and walked us through our dining experience. He was not pushing any particular menu item but more helped us create a three course dining experience with wonderful wine. That will have us coming back for more."	1

Placed my reservation through OpenTable a few days beforehand.  I arrived around 45 minutes earlier than my other table mates, so I used some of the time to check with the kitchen to see if the selections I'd wanted to try off of the RW menu would be allergen-free (for me).  It seemed like I would have some trouble with the dessert menu (I'd wanted the cannoli, but that was ruled out), but after conferring with the kitchen, the hostess said that the gelati and sorbetti were safe.  This initially anticlimactic for me, but boy, was I in for a surprise!  

As I was making my way through the courtyard (boy, this property was HUGE) looking for the source of people conversing and laughing, I decided I'd let my friends know I was waiting for them, but they snuck up on me and was at my side before I finished clicking ""send.""  Turns out the large group of people ahead of us was part of a wedding reception, so we quickly tried to find our way to the host's stand somewhere inside the cavernous restaurant.  My friends asked me if this was a resort, and I told them that I only knew it to be a restaurant.  (On our way to our table, I posed the question to the host, to which he replied that Sassi was only a restaurant, albeit one that also held many banquets.)  We were the first ones seated at one of the rooms that had patio dining overlooking gorgeous views, including Pinnacle Peak.  We each were handed wine and dinner menus, but only one RW menu, so I asked for another.  

Since I knew I was going to order the panna cotta app and the tagliatelle as my main, I decided to go with a glass of Arneis ($13).  My two friends ordered glasses of Barbaresco ($17 each).  I enjoyed my glass of white-- vanilla-scented, not too dry, and I loved the apricot and pear notes.  (I need to locate a bottle, or two, to have some at home.)  This glass held well through the app and main, as well as dessert, but I'm getting ahead of myself...  My table mates decided they'd try the other apps and entrees featured on the RW menu, so that we may all get to sample everyone's plates.

The Parmigiano and roasted garlic panna cotta app was lovely! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ#5gIYqKU2DqAaD7cihhacxQ  I've had panna cotta before, so I'd expected something much lighter, more gelatinous; This was akin to a cheese spread- dense, creamy, yet slightly crumbly.  While I loved the garlicky crostino, I found it heavily dressed.  A lighter hand with the parmigiano would've sufficed.  Still, I enjoyed the app immensely!  The house made tagliatelle, with artichoke pesto and fava beans, dusted with pecorino cheese, was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever tasted! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ#rim0X5ASqEnkKycpVFFLyQ  Exquisite in its presentation, temperature wasn't too hot, buttery, and yes, rich, but not too much so that I couldn't finish it.  In fact, I exercised restraint, only so that I could also enjoy the chocolate and vanilla gelati and apricot sorbetto for dessert (choice of three scoops). http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q#ndq8cYqhNck6u0vPP3I10Q  My fave was the apricot-- tasted so fresh and crisp; AMAZING apricot flavor!  The gelati felt too heavy in comparison, and quite frankly, a tad boring.  My three scoops of dessert at my next visit to Sassi will definitely be all sorbetti!

These are what my friends ordered:
Sicilian Eggplant Cakes- currants, pine nuts, tomato sauce http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA#aGQ1AwONWhUfk_jYf2EMPA

Would've had more, but I spotted cukes in there, too.)
Beef short rib- red wine-braised, porcini, citrus herb gremolata http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg#4R8m8Iti3apMfmDsG73Icg

The chill factor was also not very pronounced.  I really preferred my dessert!)

If you decide to go, you MUST get the Wood grilled octopus!  http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/sassi-scottsdale-3?select=xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q#xbSzBL18HlU4r6nwDrKx4Q  It's the best octopus preparation I've ever experienced!

Nonetheless, absolutely delicious meal at Sassi to celebrate my birthday.  We started with the Caprese Salad---mundane, but extraordinary due to the Buffalo Mozzarella imported from Italy.  So rich and unctuous---oh!  And also the Wood-Grilled Octopus because it was so highly touted.  It was super-chewy and tasted of nothing but char and I would not order again.  With two Antipasti courses, we skipped the Primi and went straight to Secondi.  I had the Branzino and it was perfectly cooked, beautifully accompanied and just a wonderful birthday meal.  DH got the Waygu Flat Iron Steak and had to return it.  Cooked precisely to medium rare, it was unappetizingly chewy and not a quality piece of meat.  The server took it off the bill with a gracious smile and DH just made a meal of his sides and bites of my fish.  It was okay.  We finished with this incredible dessert---all I can remember is lots and lots of rich chocolate!

We sat on the patio... on one side was Pinnacle Peak, on the other was the McDowells, and in between was a view of the valley all the way to South Maintain.  Breathtaking at sunset!  

Food was fantastic.  The octopus was perfect.  I would go back just for that.  For mains we had the short ribs and the osso buco.  Both were delicious. 
Also, they have an in house aged rye Manhattan.  It was the best Manhattan I have ever had... and I've had alot.  Service was spot on... always there when we needed something... and gone when we didn't.  I will definitely be going back."	2

1267	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	1	4	"We went here on recommendation for our anniversary dinner.  We had asked for a table with a view, but it was dark anyway and we were seated inside.  We ordered drinks and the Insalata Caprese.  After eating our appetizer we put in our dinner orders.  It was very relaxed and not rushed at all.  My husband had the Osso Buca while I enjoyed the Linguine with Clams.  The food was delicious.  We shared the cookies and biscotti for dessert.  They were ok...nothing to write home about...but the salad and main dishes were very tasty.

A manager came around and talked to each table around us, but not us.  This was a little disappointing.  We didn't have any complaints, but it would have been nice to have been asked."	3

We asked to sit outside next to the circular fireplace with a few table around it. The view from the back is outstanding. The menu has enough variety for all palates, even for vegetarian, and they are more than happy to accommodate. Our server was very polite and friendly. I wasn't very hungry so I shared a caprese and had a charred octopus on my own. Both were cooked to perfection.

This place is really outstanding for events. I remember thinking that I would like to have one of my own out here.

I hope to go back soon and sample much more of the food and spend a lot more time in the quiet of the desert."	4

Service and food was great. The bruschetta was one of my favorites. We had amazing views overlooking the gorgeous patio and the desert landscape. The location is really the selling point and the food isn't far behind. Team Sassi!	1
1271	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	We got married at Sassi in November 2012 and it was the best experience!  The staff was very helpful and knew exactly what they were doing.  The setting of this restauant/event center is as beautiful as it gets....overlooking the entire city and set in the perfect desert landscape snuggled up to Pinnacle Peak.  This is the best setting for a romantic night or entertaining friends/family.  - - And the food is absolutely to die for!  We still get complements on the wedding dinner!  Thanks Sassi!!!	1
1272	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	@quinterogolf Sassi has the most wonderful patio dining.  Enjoy this awesome weather!  Be sure to have the caprese salad.  The mozzarella is the best in town!	1
1273	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	We went for the Mother's Day brunch.  What a great experience.  Beautiful location and the service was amazing.  It was a different brunch than we were used to, but thats a good thing. Italian beef eggs Benedict, frittatas, and pastas.  Artisan cheeses and cured meats.  Overall though, the service was the best thing we had there.  Everyone was amazing. So thank you Sassi!	1
1274	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	"My husband picked Sassi's for his recent birthday dinner.  He has raved about the restaurant but I had never been.  We went with another couple to celebrate.    The cheese sticks that come in the bread basket were good but when my husband asked for more he was told they ran out  (at 7:30 on a Saturday night!) so he was disappointed.
    
I started with the Caprese Salad.   I asked about the heirloom tomatoes before ordering since I was concerned about the quality in December.   The waiter assured me they were very good and he was right!  Excellent tomatoes and the cheese was also good.  My main course was the Branzino which was good and my husband really enjoyed the Pappardelle.    Dessert was some type of apple or pear cake which I really enjoyed.    Our friends also enjoyed their meals (Grouper and Pappardelle)."	0

We started off sharing the octopus which was amazing (ask your server how the chef gets the octopus so tender; it's a neat trick!) I had the sea scallops with black squid ink pasta - amazing and perfectly portioned! My husband had the veal and we ordered a side of broccoli that was excellent! Thank you (Joseph our server) for a memorable evening Sassi, we will be back soon to see the amazing sunset!	1

The food and service were amazing. Tom and Richie were over the top with their service. We brought our three children ages 3, 6, and 8 with us and they somehow were able to keep them happy through a 2 hour dinner!  The kids had as much fun as we did and we greatly appreciated their help.

1281	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	"Really sad that they got rid of the bone in veal chop. The veal bistecca does not compare. The fava beans that come with the bistecca are awful, too. Way undercooked.

Not a fan of the management at all. When told that they should bring back the veal chop I got a pretty snotty reply and attitude.

Also, the martinis are the smallest in all of Scottsdale and not very good. 

However, the ambiance is to die for and the food is above par.

All of the appetizers are fabulous, especially the eggplant cakes appetizer, the baby beets appetizer and pork and veal meatballs."	2

A great place to take a date, where you can relax at one of the many tables indoors or enjoy the night sky out on the patio.  I had the dish with wild boar (I can't remember the name of it in Italian) it was superb!  The menu was very extensive and had everything, ranging from mussels to grass fed beef and even vegetarian options.  Our waitress also told us that the chefs try to buy locally as much as possible, which is a huge plus for me.  

The restaurant is very expensive so make sure you go with an open mind and an open wallet."	1

1293	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	"I've been interested in going to Sassi for years as I've read and heard so many great things about it, and finally we went for our anniversary. It is absolutely gorgeous, and when I went past the kitchen to find the ladies' room, the kitchen looked immaculate. Our server, Tom, was excellent--friendly, not overbearing, extremely knowledgeable about the menu, and passionate in offering suggestions.Since I had mentioned it was our anniversary on the reservation, he started by bringing us complimentary flutes of champagne (and later we were surprised by a complimentary dessert as well--amazingly good housemade cannoli). 

We took most of his suggestions--I started with the caprese and my husband with the octopus. I am a huge fan of caprese, and have measured every one I have ever had against a little restaurant in Massachusetts we used to love ages ago. This is the first time that has been surpassed. You get a six ounce ball of mozzarella, imported from Italy and you have never had such a fluffy, light cheese. My husband said the octopus was second only to Binkley's.

We next split the gnocchi, again at Tom's suggestion, and that might have been the best part of the meal. We're not usually big on gnocchi as it is so heavy and dense, being made of potato. They hand make theirs at Sassi, not out of potato, but pasta, and they are melt-in-your-mouth delicious, light, pillowy and perfectly finished with sauce and cheeese.

My main course was the salmon, wonderfully crispy from the grill, with eggplant puree, greens, friend chickpeas. I would have preferred a different kind of fish, with salmon being so common, but it was delicious. My husband got the steak with the bone marrow. It was so tender and perfectly cooked, surpassed, he claims, only by Tom Colicchio's Craftsteak in Vegas, and tied with the kobe skirt steak at Yazu Sushi in Phoenix. Believe me, we were not disappointed!

My only disappointment was the ""mood"" lighting--all we had was a candle on our table and we had a really hard time reading the menu in that small amount of light. Go to Sassi if you haven't been yet--you will thank me for it."	0

Usually wedding food is blah and dry. NOT this wedding. OMG, the chicken was amazing, the beef whatever it was, was AMAZING. Everything was so tender and delicious. We had a salad which was excellent, a penne alla vodka patas, also excellent (they had a gluten free option too!). Everything was amazing. The wedding was beautiful. it was raining and everything seemed to be seamless. Highly recommend!!	0

1298	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	"I took my father and wife here to cap off a wonderful day. The place is breathtaking and resembles an Italian villa. You truly feel as if you're in a magnificent mansion and not a restaurant. Take some time to walk around and explore the grounds and soak it all in. 
The service was impeccable and everything you would expect. The food was equally decadent and expertly crafted. The prices reflect this of course, but I MUST mention that unlike many upscale restaurants, the courses here are actually generous and not just nibble-sized. I would recommend sharing them, which makes it not quite as cost-prohibitive if you're concerned about that. I love food but there's no way I could make it through 4 courses here by myself. Perhaps Don Corleone could, but not me. 
This is one of those magical places where you can just have an exquisite meal and feel like royalty while talking in hushed tones with the love of your life, soaking in the splendor of it all and getting lost in the grandeur. Don't miss out."	3
1299	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	3	2	5	What a wonderful experience. From the food, to the wine, to the service, everything was perfect.

1301	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	We weren't sure if we should try based on some reviews but so glad that we did. As soon as you step on to the property it was a magical, beautiful property. I had the limoncello martini, very good. Our waiter was attentive and friendly. We shared the 3 types of bruschetta, delicious. My husband had the veal and said it was some of the best he has had, our friend had the flat iron which I tasted and it was awesome! I had the ricotta gnocchi, minus the anchovies, it melted in my mouth, clearly house made. They also served us a beautiful cannoli dessert for our anniversary. Would definitely go again, romantic setting. Not for children. It is pricy.	0
1302	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	0	5	I had the best pasta dish I have ever had in my life here. We started with the warm olives and grilled octopus that our waitress recommended. They were outstanding. The most interesting part about the octopus was the fried lentils (believe it or not) - it was like butter, not rubbery/chewy at all. Our server was so knowledgeable about the not only the food menu , but the wine list. She helped pair each course (the selection of wines by the glass was also something to note!). I had the special - squid ink pasta with urchin butter and fresh truffles. It changed my life. Others had the osso buco and ravioli and they were off the charts. The atmosphere was great , sunrise peak & the sunset... how can you complain?	2

Staff were extremely knowledgeable of the wines as well as the menu items.  After my arrival, the place filled quickly; ranging from couples to eight member parties. Noise was at a minimal.

I began my dining experience by having a glass of Merlot as I admired  the artwork, lighting, furniture, etc. and soaked up my surroundings. I noticed that every occupied table had a bottle of wine on it... except mine.

I was please with the entire experience. I recommend Sassi for special occasions or for those that missing true authentic Italian food."	1
1304	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	We were here when it opened about ten years back and for whatever reason hadn't been back until this week. We mostly had good feelings about the evening. Our waiter was helpful, sometimes a little too helpful since I felt there was an effort to up sell us into extra dishes or more expensive wine.  Also, he was a little loud so at the next table his explanations and commentary drowned out our table talk.  There were less expensive wines on the list. I picked one and it was excellent. Our waiter brought me a taste though urging we consider another. I was familiar with the other so didn't bother. We started with caprese salad which is plenty for a table of four to share. I had the strip steak which included marrow and had a simple vegetable. My wife had pappardelle pasta with pork Ragu. The menu warned her it was spicy but when she asked the waiter he assured her it wasn't. Unfortunately it turned out to be difficult to finish.  The dessert was a budino, a pannacota which was excellent.  It was a good dining experience. Our friends were pleased too which is good since they recommended it.	0

1309	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	For starters the atmosphere and scenery is absolutely gorgeous. The service was impeccable. Our server (Tony) was very knowledgeable not only on the menu items but had an extensive wine knowledge as well . He throughly explained each course and made great reccomendations for our first time dining here. After making our dinner selection he recommended a wine that paired beautifully. We started with the octopus which was amazing. I ordered the veal and my boyfriend had a ragu of some sort. He loved his, however I wasn't impressed with mine.  It was overpowered with a pungent salty and also acidic flavor to the point I couldn't take a second bite. Had it remade without the anchovy spread hoping that would make it less salty but it wasn't much better the second time around. The flavors just didnt balance well in my opinion. I will be back to give the food another try solely because the service and customer interaction was stellar!	0

I have been back a few times since for happy hour and cocktails until a few weeks back when I finally made it in for dinner with some girlfriends. 

The food and cocktails were great, I had their limoncello martini it was beyond delicious and worth coming back just for that! We started off with an order of their Wood Grilled Octopus and the Pork and Veal Meatballs! Both were delicious and flavorful, I was personally a huge fan of their Octopus! I had their special of the evening which was a osso bucco pasta dish which was to die for, and my girlfriends each had the Branzino and the Wagyu Flat Iron Steak. We all absolutely loved our food, but we honestly felt pretty rushed. We waited to order our entrees until after we had finished our starters just so we could space it out and we were shocked when our entrees came out no less than 10 minutes after we placed our order. In the future we will ask to space our meals out a bit more. Otherwise everything was perfect!

1313	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	1	5	We visited Sassi to celebrate our 19th wedding anniversary.  We started off ordering the Capressi, Buffalo Mozzarella flown in from Italy accompanied by heirloom tomatoes.  We were so impressed with this dish, we decided to order the Octopus which was highly recommended by our waitress Courtney.  The instant this dish arrived to our table, the aroma was captivating.  The octopus was first poached then finished over a wood fired grill to leave the meat tender yet full of flavor.   The octopus was no less than perfection, something you will not soon forget.  The atmosphere was cozy yet elegant, the perfect setting to celebrate a special occasion or just to experience fine dining at it's best.  We had the distinct pleasure of meeting Chef Christopher, sharing similar interests in exploring food as well as wild game.  The staff, the atmosphere, and our food exceeded our expectations.  This restaurant left nothing to be desired.  Well done Sassi, we will see you soon!	1

Great for Special occasions .  The outside cafes are fantastic with views of local mountains.

1315	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	"The atmosphere was wonderful sitting on the patio enjoying the great evening weather. 

We started with the bruschetta. We decided  to try all three prosciutto arugula, parmigiano; roasted peppers ricotta and the red chile Gorgonzola dates, pancetta and almonds. We shared these as each serve is very ample. The prosciutto was a little piece of heaven on a ciabatta.  This has to be  by far the best prosciutto I have tasted in the US. The first bite was so sublime I was shocked. The smoothness of the taste was amazing. I should have eaten that last as the others were just ordinary by comparison.  I personally found the red chile one rather salty. 

For the main we ordered the wood grilled veal chop and Gayle's chicken thighs accompanied by the roasted asparagus   

The veal chop was larger than anticipated.  When placed on the table it was huge. I am used to smaller veal chops. Looked like it was on steroids   Given the size I thought it may have been a little dry, but was pleasantly surprised to find it rather moist. 

The chicken thighs came out in a ultra hot cast iron pan. The lemon flavoring was tantalizing and not at all over powering. The only criticism I had of this dish was the golden potatoes overwhelmed the chicken. While the potatoes were excellent there were way to many. I had enough to share with my companion and still did not eat all that were presented. 

The roasted asparagus was perfectly done. The only down side here was it came well after the mains were presented and we were well into our meal

We did not order dessert as prior to going I had read the menu for the Mothers Day menu and was excited by what I saw. The regular menu did not appeal so we skipped ordering dessert. I would love to try the Mother's Day coconut pie though. 

I liked the feel of this establishment. I was impressed with the no phone nonsmoking rules. Love love that.   My suggestion would be to have a designated smoking area for patrons that smoke. When we left we had to walk through a group of people smoking at the arch way entry   They literally did not move we had to walk around them and through the smoke 

The service was excellent. We were surprised at the end of our meal with cannoli as an acknowledgment of our anniversary. A very pleasant evening."	1

Once we entered and were sat, the service was top-notch. Very great with recommendations and the food came out fast.

We got meatballs as an appetizer and I wish we had gotten 2-3 ore dishes of it! Very very good way to start.  The rest of the meal was good but all I kept thinking of was the meatballs.

Overall, this place was great. Expect to pay more but it is worth it for a nice night out."	0

1323	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	We came back here last night to enjoy a nice pre-Mother's Day dinner.  We were here in March and the food was excellent but our server was mediocre. Last night we had Simon as our waiter and he did a phenomenal job! He was so knowledgeable about the wine list. I had the branzino on both visits. Last night they had it stuffed with crab. It was delicious both times but more so last night. We highly recommend sitting on the patio and enjoying the beautiful view and the tasty food and wine.	1
1324	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	1	4	This is probably one of the most beautiful restaurants I've ever been to this would be a must so if you want to have a nice anniversary or a proposal or something very special to atmosphere the scenery everything is top-notch unfortunately I have to start off with the mediocre service not sure if the server just didn't want to be at work or that was just me and I kid eating so he thought he wasn't going to tip he has had a nasty attitude overall by the end it was a little better but the start off with not good that's on that run the night it was such a nice night outside start off with the grilled octopus iPad octopus mini places and I would say that's probably one of the best I've ever had seriously Tinder the dressing they put on it was very well-balanced then take away from the dish at all I almost ordered a second one even my son likes it a lot and he is not a fish person I would like weenie and clams that was very good as well not the best I've ever had but still very good everything was cooked great son the gnocchi which he didn't really look like it I tried it it was okay but I didn't realize when we ordered it it was just made out straight or ricotta cheese not potato so I had no firmness to it and the sauces pretty heavy probably when I order that again I have the brown sugar pina cotta it was okay I was expecting a little bit more when it get it again but overall pretty great experience besides a waiter but he got better at the end so I don't know would you go back for sure	0

1326	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	The lounge area on Friday's and Saturday's is the place to be. They have different pianist both nights that give a fun but relaxing environment, great for sipping cocktails and unwinding after a long week. We typically snack on the bruschetta board (DELICIOUS!) but the times we have ordered entrees have been fabulous as well. If you live in the North Scottsdale area and are looking for a beautiful, relaxing and fun place to unwind, look no further!	0
1327	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	"Extraordinary setting and experience while celebrating my birthday. Outstanding in every way. Joseph our server was top notch and the food was superb. We started off with cocktails at the bar and then ventured to my favourite table. I remembered the table number from years ago and YES it was still there wooo hooo. 

Our appetizers were squash blossoms and bruschetta with prosciutto on one and tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella on another. Then for entrees, my friend had the eggplant cakes and I had the papardelle with spicy eggplant ragu. I could not have asked for better service as Joseph kept checking on us every couple of minutes along with his server assistant.

YES Sassi is totally worth it. Hard to believe I had not reviewed the restaurant yet but I don't even think Yelp was around back then. Highly recommended !"	4
1328	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	It was awesome!! Sad It took me 11 years to find this place. Worst thing about that I live less than 2 miles away! Great place for date night, family, and they had a wedding going on as well. Beautiful place, great food!!	1
1329	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	"Love! Love!  Love!
As we were driving ti this restaurant from Tempe, I had No Idea where we were. It was dark, random roads up in pinnacle peak and wondering where in the world is my husband taking us for our anniversary. Once we got there, i loved the feel of the restaurant. Felt so romantic with a lights of the phoenix city lights. 

We were seated with a fabulous server who explained the menu items perfectly! We had the signature octopus that was delicately grilled and so tender. Then the ricotta gnocchi that just melted in my mouth. I then had the yellowfin tuna with had some Heat! Yowzer! My husband had the scallops that were cooked perfectly. The dessert was awesome too! Pear brown cake was SO GOOD!!!! I wish I could go back right now. Definitely recommend even with the long drive."	2

Small rooms divide the space creating an intimate dining atmosphere. The spaces are graced with lovely furnishings and decor. 

Chef Chris prepared tasty gnocchi, perfect salmon and house made sausages that were packed with flavor. If the old adage ""cooking is all in the ingredients"" then by all means that supports the good food to be had here. The owner told us that local, seasonal food properly grown and caught is of utmost importance to their menu planning.

The grounds and gardens are a perfect venue for a special event. We look forward to our next visit here in Scotsdale and dining here once again."	0
1331	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	If you want to experience a True Italian restaurant, not Americanized Italian, Sassi is absolutely the place. The pastas are fresh made, the warm olives and prosciutto de Parma are outstanding and the service and ambience are one of a kind. Special occasion or romantic dinner out, this is the place!  Did I mention the amazing views of Phoenix high above the city near Pinnacle Peak mountain? Breathtaking!	0
1332	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	Most amazing dining experience ever. I have nothing bad to say. Every element came together in perfect harmony. Just go!	0
1333	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	5	"The most notable thing about Sassi is the ambience.  The restaurant is located within an Italian villa, with eating rooms scattered here and there.  The building is impressive but the star is the outdoor patio which features mountain and desert views, spectacular especially at sunset.  

The food might not quite make five stars but the view -- ah, the view.

BIG HINT:  Get a patio table.  Request it on your reservation and go early particularly on busy days.

As to the food, Sassi clearly uses very high quality ingredients, and the kitchen staff prepares everything well.  I can site the very fresh greens and goat cheese in our salad, and an exceptional branzino.  However, in all cases, the flavor profiles are nothing special - salt and pepper and lemon they know about, but there are few other spices, and the sides to the entrees were uninspired, and in one case, inedible (stringy broccolini).

For two people, with a carafe of sangria, olives, two appetizers, two entrees, one dessert and coffee, the tab came to $160 including tax and tip.  Not cheap but just about right for what Sassi delivers.

SMALL HINT:  Since you want to see sunset from your patio table, April and May are the best months to go.  The temperature outside will probably be great, and sunset occurs late enough so that you can watch it during your dinner."	6

My fiancé and I looked at 10 different venues and fell in love with Sassi the moment we walked in. The atmosphere is inviting, cozy, and elegant! We knew we didn't want a huge wedding and the reception space was the perfect size for 100 people. We had a tight budget and Vicky worked with us to explore a few dates to find which one would work best for our budget. It just so happened that the best date for us happened to be Valentine's Day which is also my fiancé's parent's anniversary. After booking and signing our contract, Vicky took no time to get us all of our ""wedding homework"" and kept in contact with us every step of the way. Our food tasting was unbelievable and I knew our guests were just to love, love, love the food! As the wedding approached, Vicky kept us updated on what was happening and what she needed from us. The day of our rehearsal, Vicky was there early to corral all of our wedding party and was extremely efficient while walking us through the ceremony and reception flow. I was so surprised when we asked to help set up décor and Vicky said they would take care of everything! The day of, we arrived with our hair and make up already done and Vicky made sure we could sneak into the bridal suite and avoid any of the guys seeing us. We got dressed, did our first look, and did pictures of the bridal party while Vicky and the rest of the staff finished setting everything up. Vicky helped keep us on time and made sure that even if things were going wrong, I didn't know about it. As predicted, our guests loved all of the food and the scenery of the venue. We have beautiful shots with the mountains and sunset in the background and loved all of the rooms of the restaurant that we could use for pictures. Our number one goal for our wedding was to have fun and we had the time of our life. I cannot thank Vicky and the Sassi staff enough for making Valentine's Day the best day of our lives!"	1
1335	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	1	5	Great Ambiance!  We started off with the Prosciutto di Parma which was great.  We had the Pan Seared Sea Scallops and Orecchiette and they were delicious. For dessert I enjoyed the Gianduja Mousse.  OH MY NUTELLA!  Which was a hazelnut and milk chocolate mousse, nutella gelato.  It was to a memorable experience all together.  I can see why folks have their corporate events and wedding receptions here.  It is a beautiful facility.  The staff and Manager is super friendly and checked in on us which was nice.  I look forward to going back.	1

1340	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	The atmosphere at Sassi is to die for. There are twinkling lights everywhere and you almost feel like you're in a villa in Tuscany. There are multiple rooms: some with fireplaces, some with cozy nooks. The staff was very friendly from the hostesses to our server who went out of his way to make sure that we were pleased with our experience. They also had separate wait staff who cleared the dishes all at once which I thought was a nice touch. I enjoyed the risotto, although I personally would have liked less in the dish than there was (there was too much cheese or onions or something). My boyfriend also loved the lamb chops. The prices were somewhat expensive but not too outrageous because of the quality of the entire experience. Next time we are in Scottsdale, I would love to come to watch the sunset on the mountains.	0
1341	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	2	1	4	"I have only been here for large catering type events, but from what I have seen and eaten I like it.

Most event food is bland and textures. The event food here is nearly as good as what one would expect in a made to order dish. The outdoor space offers great views and some shade. 

The indoor space is well appointed and is far from the typical folding ball room feel, it feels like the large dining room in your newly rich uncles house.

If you having an event the one issue is the remote location. An uber ride form just about anywhere will cost you far more than you saved from overusing the open bar."	1
1342	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	0	0	4	"UPDATE.  Went there last year for my free veterans day dinner so did it again tonite.
So here is how it went:
1.  bread came.  odd there was no butter but he olive oil was better pick anyway.
2.   Salad was ok.
3.  My friend had the chicken, with mashed potato's and veggie.  He liked.  I had the roast pork which was very tender and huge.  Great mashed potato's. Great dinner.  We were both pleased.
4.  very little room for desert but we tried.
5.  overall a great meal and the service was great.  It took a while for the food to come out but it was crowded and there was a big wedding party going on too, so they were busy there.
6.  Last year they charged us full tax on a $175 freebie and mandatory $22 tip.  This year the two meals would have cost anyone else $110 but we were just charged $15 for a few drinks, so we had more money for a tip.  Can't complain.  Very few people seem to know about their free veterans day meal.  It is not advertised.  It sure beats getting a free burger at Hooters!
I spend a lot of time at the Scottsdale Gun Club, so after my next visit perhaps I will stop by here for the happy hour. The place is expensive but that nice plush building has a lot of overhead.  A good place to impress a date. Besides i was driving a new Lexus tonite so I fit right in."	0
1343	O6rGW7A7l_125-xzTZkRLQ	1	0	5	My fiancé and I needed a place to have our (very small) wedding - just the two of us, two witnesses and the minister. Sassi agreed to let us use their rear patio for our ceremony and charged us no fee whatsoever! Of course the four of us stayed for dinner, and the experience was awesome. The ambience was outstanding, the wait staff was very attentive and knowledgeable, and the food could not have been better. It is certainly a great place for any kind of special event!!	1

We sat in the bar area and Happy hour made me VERY happy. A bottle of Prosecco and 3 bruschetta for $29. Let me recommend the Peach and sweet and spicy pepper, and the chef was good enough to share his recipe for how he made the peppers. 

We both had pasta and it was cooked perfectly with just the right amount of sauce. 

The bar tender / waiter was perfect and the other patrons were friendly and engaging as well.

It was a pleasant evening. The bartender was very nice. She suggested an Italian blood orange cocktail that was sweet, tasty and quenched your thirst. Appetizers were crispy shrimp and crab cakes.  We ordered superfood salad and chopped salad. These were all very tasty. For the main course we had Bone-in Ribeye and Alaskan King Crab legs.  The ribeye was to die for. Marbling in the meat was a work of art as the fat just rolled off of the tongue with every canine tear of the meat. It was ordered medium rare.  It became more medium rear towards the center.  The flavor gave reason why one is a carnivore.  The king crab legs were huge and beautiful. Although it was a bit salty. Sometimes you wonder why something as beautiful as this is salty. Is it to cover up some flaw in the taste. Otherwise it was not overcooked and it was moist.  The shells were packed full of meat. 
The service was impeccable.  The bathroom was mostly clean.  There were a few splashes on the floor."	0

1355	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	4	At this price range, I expect a lot: Great food and great service. The atmosphere is swank for a steakhouse and what I got was VERY GOOD overall. First, we made an 8pm reservation via OpenTable for a Saturday night. We got seated about 20-30 mins late...no big deal, we weren't in hurry. After a round at the bar we sat down. The waiter was very professional and courteous, though he just took our order, checked on us and served drinks. Others actually served us our food and cleared our plates. I thought he was a touch arrogant in his opinions on the food. When I asked if they offered any special rubs, he replied they only offer the house rub. OK, but another at the table likes spice and asked for jalapeños, the waiter replied they have none...but our calamari and shrimp appetizer showed up with jalapeños... Go figure. The shrimp and calamari was very lightly crusted and fried...excellent. Next we shared the Alaskan King Crab legs...AMAZING!  Also amazing was the FRESH bread. The salad was tasty, but too drenched in dressing. The bone-in ribeye was on the rare side if medium-rare and delicious, but the rub was nothing special. The creamed spinach and brussell sprout sides were tasty!  Mashed potatoes, well whipped, but wanting flavor. The molten chocolate cake with ice cream was huge!  Enough for 4. I'd recommend this place for special occasions and over-the-top business dinners. Enjoy.	0

Filet was superb - flavorful, moist, tender and delicious. Ribeye was also great tasting, but not very tender as compared to the filet. Lobster mash is dynamite. Enjoyed the option of a smaller side portion, though the small is enough to feed 3-4 people. Loved the binget tree for a light dessert. Dark, intimate and romantic modern setting.

The top shelf Management team is always there to greet you, check in, and maintain a high level of quality. Our waiter, Chad, however, must have missed the  Dominick's  memo. Our family table (specifically requested to be upstairs) of 9 folks were taken care of by Chad in a manner more suited for someone who wished he was anywhere but delivering the fine, memorable dining experience I've come to expect. It was almost as if he was tuned out and disinterested  the entire evening. No emphasis on making it a pleasant dining experience for anyone in our party, that's for sure. It was too bad that my family had an incredible meal that was left unnecessarily bitter by the apathetic service of one waiter. Dominick's (and my family) deserved better.	2

I ordered a steak and wow.  It was aged and cooked perfectly (medium so still very pink to red in the center)  They really know their steak here!  Potato sides were also amazing.

The chocolate cake dessert at the end was super rich and chocolatey.  Fantastic.  This is definitely a higher-priced choice in restaurant, but worth every dime.  Highly recommended."	1

Dominick's is hands down my favorite steakhouse in AZ. Whether you come for the well-priced Happy Hour, or do a nice sit down dinner at a table, you with be pleased in either scenario.

Kevin always provides me and my family with excellent service on the dining floor, and good ol Dan always makes a perfect martini behind the bar.

Try the NY strip of any size, it's definitely a gem. The sides are all wonderful, particularly the Brussel sprouts. Butter cake isn't called ""Butter Cake"" anymore... But ask about it. It's the best thing you'll ever eat.

Mastro's, City Hall, and Ocean Club still have a ton of popularity... But chef Lupino cooks for Dominick's and Steak 44. So obviously the best steak in AZ has found its home with this company."	2

I was very excited to go back, because the first visit was amazing!  This time we sat upstairs where the roof opened after the sun went down enough to not bother anyone.  It was beautiful!  The food was outstanding!  I ordered bone-in filet medium with truffle butter, creamed spinach, creme brûlée corn & lobster mashed potatoes. The sides are all served for sharing.

Be prepared, everything they offer is quite rich; smaller portions but not a light meal by any means.

I have also hosted business dinners here and its a fantastic spot to be on an expense account at.   Although our bill was quite hefty; my client was equally as impressed.  The bone-in filet is a must; thank goodness it is on their regular menu instead of only being a special.  (I hate when I am at a steakhouse and they run out of bone in filets before I can order.) 

The setting is dark and intimate.   The valet parking is well appreciated given the crowds at the shopping community that surrounds it.  Granted, you get the plastic Scottsdale crowd here, but what did you expect?"	0

Our party of six was seated at a beautifully decorated table that recognized each of our anniversaries. We all had a drink and ordered the spicy shrimp and calamari for appetizers. For our main course we ordered the bone-in veal chop, bone-in filet, New York strip, bone-in Kansis City strip and sea scallops. Our sides were au gratin potatoes and brussel sprouts with bacon. Everything was cooked to perfection and delicious. For dessert we were served two beautiful and tasty complimentary desserts. Our wait staff was headed by Ula. She and her team were appropriately attentive and made the entire evening a memorable experience we will not forget. Kudos!	0

We loved our servers Kim & Ethan! They were both fantastic! We loved their recommendations. The crispy shrimp appetizer, 19 crimes red wine, and the ultimate warm vanilla caramel cake were our favorites! We would love to come back again.	1

Upon return to Dominick's for a second try, it did a complete 180. The restaurant was full yet spacious and waiters were exceptionally accommodating. The waiter Brad was extremely knowledgeable and was able to answer all questions regarding menu. He explained, suggested and gave us a little background on several items on then menu. 

The Sauté shrimp appetizer was the perfect size for two people. A little kick to it, large and full of flavor. My guest simply said ""this is the best I've ever had""

I ordered the sea scallops again which were delicious. The portion was perfect and seared to perfection. 

My guest ordered the Chillian Sea bass and wow! I'm not a fish eater. I like shell fish and that's it. I do not like any fish but he assured me this would be different and Wow! This was just phenomenal. We added bread crumbs which gave it a bit of texture but it wasn't breaded. Very unique and definitely made a difference. 

Three words ...Creme brûlée corn. Amazing! 

We really enjoyed our dinner compared to our last visit. I will chalk that up to the PGA in town and it being extremely busy. I would definitely recommend Dominicks and will return."	1
1377	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	2	1	4	Dominick's is very much an old-school steakhouse, and I mean that as a compliment.  Their New York strip was simply the best steak I had during my recent Scottsdale visit -- generous portion of perfectly cooked and seasoned meat.  The sides were unambitious (potatoes, snap peas, sauteed mushrooms) but perfectly executed.  Salads were meh.  My sorbet assortment (lemon, grapefruit, blood orange (I think)) were on the bold side (thought the grapefruit was the best), and the portions were extremely generous.  Beer selection was a little weak at the upstairs bar, but good wine list.  Excellent service.	2
1378	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	"Great location and ambiance, especially if you're looking for a romantic evening out. I had the petite filet which was melt in your mouth, and the service as to be expected was excellent. It can be a little over the top and feel uppity, but considering the area in North Scottsdale I think it's par for the course and I'm sure most diners actually appreciate that about them. 
The desserts I don't think are that great...which is surprising to me. I'll order an extra glass of wine the next time I'm there instead.
Overall I think this is a great steakhouse and if you haven't tried it, it is a definite must!"	1

The sides were super big and we got three, I wasn't aware they you could get half sides, but we will next time! They surprised us with dessert at the end which was a nice touch.

1384	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	2	1	5	"Another solid dining experience at Dominick's!  I've dine here several times and its slowly becoming my favorite steakhouse in all of Arizona.  The customer service always shines though and the food and ambiance is amazing.  So here's an updated review, everything was on point from the great customer service to the awesome food that we ordered.

So my wife and I made a reservation on Saturday Night at 6:30.  We arrived and were seated promptly.  The location of the tables wasn't the greatest, cause there are a lot of waiters running by and the bar was on the other side, which made it a little noisy.  Other than that, everything was fantastic.  Our server was Kevin, the guy was attentive and on it.  It seems they work as a team, cause every time my lemonade or water reached half full, they were on top of it!  Soon when we finished our dishes, they cleared it with the quickness.  Impressive service for sure.  So we ordered the prime meatballs, shared a super salad for appetizers.  Then we ordered the Heritage porkchop, and cluster of King Crab legs, and shared the corn and Dominick potatoes.  My wife likes her meat well done, so I ""imagined"" it was cooked to her liking, she said it was very good.  My crab legs were delicious.  They were split open with a side of lemon and clarified  butter.  I would hate to see what I looked like smashing those legs, they were so damn good.  Alaskan Red King Crab probably one of my favorite foods, and this cluster did not disappoint.

Overall, another solid experience, Dominick's is the real deal.  Right now, i would put them over Mastro's Ocean Club, which used to be my favorite.  I know Scottsdale is loaded with great steakhouses, but Dominick's is slowly separating themselves from the competition.  Keep up the good work!"	1
1385	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	2	0	5	Dominick's is by far the best steakhouse I've had. Our server, Rauson was a top notch waiter. He knew specific details about the menu. He tended to our requests and was so diligent. I will definitely come back.	2
1386	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	First time here last night to celebrate Valentine's day and I loved it overall! Food was sooo good! Pricey but well worth it. The waitress did an excellent job best one yet, and loved how she could explain all the food and her enthusiasm on how good the food was!she wasn't lieing! Only thing I did not like was that we took our food home and it wasn't the whole amount that they had taken from our table to pack.	0
1387	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	1	1	4	"Stopped by on a Sat night for a glass of wine.  Cool place. It has an old NY steakhouse feel to it.  Wife and I had a couple great glasses of wine and the entertainment was awesome. 
Wine - seemed expensive for a glass but we liked the vibe so decided to have a glass anyway. The pour is about a glass and a half so any thoughts I had about price quickly went away. And, the service was really good in the bar area. 
Entertainment - there was a lady singing that was incredible. She was just chillin in a booth singing Adele, Diana Ross, Michael Jackson, you name it. Awesome!
Lastly, the people watching was great. Lots of sugar daddy's with their lady friends.  Cool place!"	1

That said the meal was great, however, we do prefer the old recipe for what was called ""Butter Cake"", the fruit was a nice touch. Nonetheless, everything was satisfactory."	1
1390	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	The oysters On the Half-Shell were amazingly fresh. My bone in steak was perfect. My fiance had the crab cakes and it had lump crab in it the size of quarters! The service was perfect and the food was amazing. The only issue I had was with the entitled millennial wife beater who screamed at his date for 10 minutes then tried to start fights with the tables around him. Management kicked him out and they comped our drinks. Not the ideal situation to propose to my girlfriend but Dominicks management handled it with class. I will be back!	0

First time on a date with the wife for dinner and the steak was great and the sides were fantastic, service is just ridiculous.  Second time we were on a double date to iPic theater and we stopped at the bar and ordered a ton of their appetizers and had several of their specialty drinks.  I wish I could remember my favorite but I was pretty lit.  Its not cheap so dont come here expecting any deals but you will impress the woman in your life for sure.	0

1402	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	1	4	"I revisited Dominick's again in January 2016. Once again, it was a cold evening, as per usual. We were seated pool-side again. I didn't expect for the heaters to work so I brought a big coat and a scarf, but really--my question remains: WHY DON'T THEY TURN ON THE HEATERS???? I have dined at many establishments that have partial outdoor set-ups and they always have their heaters humming. I even took the time to email management about this situation to find out what their answer was. I haven't received a reply. It just ticks me off when customer service drops off. Once you've dined, they no longer seem to care...

The Food: Was delicious. It was as good as the first time I dined. I have no complaints about that. My steak was better than many other ""big steakhouses"" I've been to in 2015. You can read my other reviews to know where I stand on various restaurants that specialize in cow.

The Service: Good except for the lie about turning on the heaters. The waiter agrees to do it and then walks away. He just figures you'll forget by time the food arrives I guess. I don't like being lied to in any area of my life.

Tips about where to sit: The upstairs isn't just COLD in the winter months, but there are other factors to consider. If you want to have a romantic evening or even a nice conversation with your dining partner, I would recommending sitting elsewhere. The problem with the upstairs location is that is where large parties are seated, along one wall. We had the good fortune (NOT) of being next to a table full of haughty 20-something Scottsdale children who were loud, unrefined, and basically an embarrassment to my gender. I was taught good manners for restaurants. I guess this is a demonstration of the ""everyone gets a trophy"" society that we live in. I was appalled at the drunken chatter emanating from this table. I knew EVERYTHING about this 23 year old girl by time they left: age, marital status, that she was no longer on her parents' insurance or phone bill (IMAGINE THAT?). Thus, if you'd rather be insulated from Scottsdale's Finest, I recommend requesting a table elsewhere in the restaurant.

Reservations: Don't show up early. You will NOT be seated one minute before your time has arrived.

To those commenting on the music: Yup, it's a pretty lame mix. I'd rather have nothing than that."	0
1403	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	1	1	5	"To start the night off they offer complimentary valet. This was a good hit for me because I HATE driving around looking for a parking space.

The serves at this restaurant was superb. We ordered the 12oz steak and shared. It's was More the. Enough. The sizes are very BIG. It's enough for at least 4 people to share. So try to order different things so that you get to taste a little bit of everything.

Spinach- I'm not a spinach fan so I won't say much about it but my friends said it was just Ok

Mushrooms- Once again I'm not a fan of mushrooms but my table thought it was the best side dish. It was seasoned to perfection (so I was told)

Broccoli- I like my broccoli a little tender. Not hard has a rock. Sooo the broccoli would have been better if I informed the waiter what I wanted.

Potatoes- now this was yummy. It was like eating potatoes in the style of lasagna. 

Onion Focaccia  was a different treat to start the night off. Totally not your typical bread. 

I enjoyed my experience with this Dommicks will definitely come back."	1

Five stars for food: My husband LOVES a good, rare filet and Dominick's delivered exceptionally. No frills, just a perfectly cooked filet with excellent flavor. I loved my beet salad--delicious!  And all our sides, including my mashed potatoes (though a little over-salted) were rich.

Lovely interior. It has a rich charm and is complete with a guy playing the piano. If I were mob, I surely would be having major deals go down or bring my goo-ma here. I love that there are hard-boiled eggs on the bar for ""snacks"" - forget that disgusting party mix or popcorn.

Shrimp cocktail to start (comes with 3...ordered 1 extra), bone-in New York (asked for it sliced so it was easy to share) and then creamed spinach. Of course, the bread basket comes out first - there was a delicious onion bread that was incredible.

The shrimp came out large and in charge. They have a seriously hot horseradish - love this (although wasn't as amazing as my all-time favorite... City Hall's crack-laced horseradish that I want to marry.) Bummer... there was no spoon for the ketchup/horseradish - probably just got overlooked in the kitchen. Steak came out perfectly, even though they forgot to slice it. DARN! But we managed to saw away at the hunk of meat anyways. It's the best to order it rare or medium rare and then you can sear the slices on the butter-laden smokin' hot plates! Learned that trick from a friend, try it next time.

The creamed spinach was INCREDIBLE!! It was less ""creamed"" then you'd usually expect but the texture and flavor was perfect. It had a Parmesan crusted top or something that was magic and just added the perfect touch. Hands down a winner.

Overall great service, great food and if I find myself in the area, I'd definitely be back."	2

I made the reservation on Open Table and yes and they do require Credit Card and if its a no show and you don't cancel 72hrs in advance, it's $50 per person penalty charge, stated in the fine print. Our reservations were at 6:45, we were greeted and seated promptly at a table for 4 by the bar area, though it was fairly loud it but manageable and fun to people watch. Our server Victoria was great. We started off with the Super Colossal Shrimp (house-made cocktail sauce - atomic horseradish) and the Steakhouse Caesar Salad (romaine, classic dressing, fresh baked garlic croutons, fresh anchovies). Entree were the Boneless 12oz. Ribeye, the 22oz. Bone-In Ribeye, 12oz. NY Strip with the Truffle Butter, Baked Potato ""loaded"" and the Hand Cut Fries. All the food was excellent and perfectly cooked.

Perfect Service, perfect dinner, perfect time."	2

The food is beyond amazing , full of flavor and cooked to perfection . They constantly make sure you have beverage , crumbs wiped off the table and clean napkins at all times . They thought we waited to long for our appetizer and brought a free beignet donut tree after our dinner ! But before the donut tree they brought us hot wet towels to clean our hands . There isn't 1 negative thing about this place !	0

We were first timers here for my husbands birthday, and had a great experience. I actually made the reservation through open table and Im glad I did it in advance! They were very busy for a random Thursday night.

Atmosphere is classy looking like most steakhouses, but they play more modern beats which is a nice change. We were seated at a booth table ""upstairs"" and our servers name was Brad. Let me tell you, Brad provided amazing service!! He was very enthusiastic about the menu & wished my husband a sincere ""Happy Birthday."" You can tell he likes his job and he was very personable.

Food was obviously great! We ordered sauteed shrimp & fried deviled eggs to start, then petite filets, crab & rock shrimp mac n cheese, & corn brulee. The menu is very similar to Steak 44, but I much prefer this location because the overall experience exceeded any from Steak 44. Steaks were perfectly seasoned and cooked to order, the mac n cheese is to DIE FOR, & I loved the crunch sugar bits in the corn brulee.

For dessert, we got a complimentary Cookies n Cream popcorn sundae which was also very delicious. We also enjoyed drinks-- Strawberry Rhubarb cooler (very refreshing) & my husband got the Effen Vodka blood orange drink (I forgot the name.)

Overall, excellent service and food-- will definitely be coming back!"	0

The food is always good: filet, sides, appetizers, and that bread! The happy hour menu is good but the portions sure are small. If you go earlier in the evening (before 6pm) the dining room is pretty empty and there will be plenty of waiters to serve you.  The atmosphere inside is very nice whether you are on the bar side or on the dining room.  Definitely worth a shot if you're celebrating something or just feel like some having protein.	1

From time to time, the service does lack the quality and attention to detail expected from such a restaurant and the steaks are not always prepared the way they should be. The consistency is not quite there when compared to a rival like City Hall. 

Regardless, Dominick's is a great place to be! Cant go wrong."	0

1434	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	1	0	4	"LOVE LOVE LOVE Dominick's - by far the best steakhouse in the Phoenix area.  

However, the one complaint I have is the recent change they have made to their bread service.  They used to bring a beautiful basket of assorted breads including pretzel rolls and an amazing onion focaccia.  Last time I went, they brought out a little cast iron skillet filled with yeast rolls that weren't even very flavorful.  The server informed us that this was their new bread service.  I was sorely disappointed as this silly skillet with a kitchen towel wrapped around the handle really cheapens the Dominick's experience.  If management reads this, I truly hope they will consider changing back.  

Other than that, Dominick's is truly fantastic and the steaks melt in your mouth.  Happy hour is amazing as well."	3
1435	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	6	6	4	"First time here, what a cool location, the whole space is very unique and on a very grand scale.  I dined with a large group last night for a co-workers 40th and we had a really great time.   The service was impeccable, they didn't hover, but for a large somewhat rowdy group everyone's wishes were met promptly.  We were seated in the top floor ""pool area"" and they opened up the roof, the weather was amazing last night so this was a very nice touch for the event.  

The menu was prix fixe, and I loved that they went as far as to print a special and personalized ""Happy Birthday"" menu for friend.  We had the Calamari and their amazing dinner rolls for the appetizer and I had a wedge salad with blue cheese to start and chose the 12 oz NY encrusted with blue cheese (not on the menu but they accommodated) as my entree.   The steak was cooked a perfect medium rare, and the blue cheese was browned on top.  We had mashed and brussel sprouts, both were very good.  The standout, and it's a small thing was the Blue Cheese both on the salad and the steak it was amazing. 

As a special touch they had a magnum of my friends favorite wine and asked all the guests to sign it with a silver sharpie, what a great reminder that will be for her for years to come.  Hats off to Jeff and the team at Dominick's for taking extra special care of us and filing our bellies with a delicious meal.  The ""upgraded"" desserts at the end were brilliant, they gave a sampling of every sweet treat on the menu.   Killer beignet trees, S'mores, and buttercake!"	7
1436	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	2	2	5	"really excellent service. a little bit of a strange crowd, but whatever. the food was great. 

they start you off with this really yummy garlic parmesan bread served in a little cast iron skillet. i had to stop myself from eating too much of it! got to save room for the steak. 

we ordered a bottle of wine and started with the PB&J. if you're debating which starter to have, definitely go with the PB&J...the bourbon isn't overwhelming, the pate is super smooth and the crostini a perfect complement. not too heavy either, so you can leave your appetite for the main course.

i ordered the bone in ribeye. it was served on an extremely hot plate and cooked to PERFECTION. it stayed warm throughout the meal even as i took my time to savor each bite.

for sides we ordered the dominick's potatoes. get those for sure. also ordered veg, our server recommended keeping it simple with those so we got the brussels.

finished off the meal with a bit of sorbet and the cutest most delicious little cookies. i can only hope my next steak is executed just as well!"	3

My boyfriend made the reservation and indicated that it was for a birthday and that we would like to be seated near the pool. If you do get to sit near the pool, make sure to bring something to keep you warm IF you get cold easily. It wasn't cold on the top floor, it's more the wind that is pushing through that was not from outside, so you can get a little chilly. 

Why I could not give it a 5 star was not because of the food or the dining room. It was mainly because the server we had. Our server did not seem like he wanted to be working that night and it showed on his face. Also, my boyfriend and I only had one bread roll each, out of 6 pieces, and they took it without asking us if we were done. Not sure why they did that but it really confused us and I was hangry so I really wanted the bread. 

But I will say, this is one of my favorite steakhouses (hands down)!"	1
1442	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	2	1	4	Had I not had an office Christmas party to attend at Dominick's, it's unlikely I'd have ever made the trek up North to dine at one of the latest trendy, pricey, steakhouses Scottsdale has to offer.  However I would have been missing out, because D's provided me with one of the most succulent, incredible cuts of sizzling meat I've ever sunk my sharp little teeth into.  A brilliant New York strip, medium rare with a nice crust of salt, pepper, & butter, served with perfectly gooey au gratin potatoes and sweet & spicy sugarsnap peas- utter perfection.  Also, I'm always particularly impressed when a business can pull off exceptional food and service for very large parties, and they did just that.  It's very showy and elegant, with a red-carpet to boot, but a really fun reason to get dressed up and feast like a Queen.	3

The layout of the building is quite interesting; downside here is that it's pretty crowded and very dimly lit. Makes for an interesting journey up to the top floor. There's a pool upstairs in the middle of the room which makes for some sweet ambiance. The music was also great; a blend of pop, rock and house set the mood for a vibrant evening. 
The food exceeded my already high expectations of the place. For appetizers we went with crab cakes and shrimp Dominick; both very delicious. I went with the lobster for my main course; it was cooked to perfection. Don't even get me started on the lobster mashed and the loaded mashed potatoes..... They were melt-in-your-mouth heavenly. My mouth is water just thinking about them....
Last but not least, the créme brûlée.... Woah. This is by far my favorite dessert of all time, and I kid you not when I say this was the best I ever had! May go back just for the dessert.

My parents dine here regularly and we were lucky enough to join them last night. We had a little bit of everything. Every dish was delicious and our server, Liz, made the dining experience extra special. We had a small hiccup on the preparation of a steak, but the manager, Brian, went above and beyond to make it right. Fantastic customer service all around. If you have been contemplating going...GO!

1449	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	"Came here with my bro since we got a gift card for Christmas, so my expectations for the meal were low/average. However, I thoroughly enjoyed everything I ate at Dominick's and was very satisfied with the friendly natural service and the taste of the food.

Start off with the bread. They have several flavors, of which we opted for sea salt and butter. I'll be straight with you, this is probably the best free bread I've ever had at dinner. The rolls are served monkey bread style in a hot cast iron pan. From the richness of the salt and butter on the outer layer to the soft bread on the inside, this was a perfect fusion of dinner roll and pretzels. Would love to try to other flavors - but unfortunately I ate three pieces by myself.

Our appetizer was the shrimp and calamari combo. Two seafoods, three sauces, one solid dish. You get a solid portion of both proteins. While the sauces are somewhat basic from ketchup to some sort of remoulade, they were all enjoyable. Gotta love the banana peppers slipped in there as well.

Now for the main attraction and the sides. My bro got the bone out rib-eye Oscar style (crab cake, asparagus, and hollandaise) while I got the hefty bone in version. Both medium rare, and well seasoned compared to some other name steakhouses in the area.

My bro is still a little bro, so the least adventurous sides he could eat were steamed broccoli and truffle fries. With the small version of each, that should have been plenty. The broccoli was a manageable size but came with hollandaise sauce to dip (say what!?). The truffle fries seemed much bigger by comparison, and I like how neither the truffle nor the cheese was overpowering. 

If you order any kind of appetizer, I would recommend one side at most for two people. Otherwise two could be fine.

I came in expecting some okay overpriced food, but honestly I loved everything here. Would love to come back on my own dime and take the family on a special occasion."	0
1450	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	Best steakhouse in Phoenix/Scottsdale IMHO.  Bone in ribeye was perfectly prepared and served on a sizzling plate.  The meat was aged to perfection and was as tender as a filet mignon cut.  We were not going to finish an entire bottle of wine tonight, so ordered by the glass.  The pour was generous.  The prices are what you'd expect from a tier-one steakhouse.  However, the quality, ambience, white linen service without the stuffy attitudes, really sets this place apart.  If you're a car aficionado, there will usually be something parked outside that will get your motor running.	0

We came here on a night when Larry Fitzgerald was hosting a charity event upstairs, but were seated promptly when we arrived. Our waiter was quick, thorough, and unobtrusive, and we never had to ask for cocktails, which is a big plus for me. The place is pricey (especially the wine list), but not any worse than most of the other high end steak houses in town.
I have only two complaints about our experience: 1)The music was a little loud (which is fine in the bar, but not so much in the dining room); and 2) When they called the next day to ask how we'd liked our meal, I told them both of us thought the music was a hair too loud. I was informed:  ""... oh ... well our managers like it that way.""

If I had gone with my wife I would have definitely selected the dining room or most likely the upstairs area. The upstairs area had a decorative pool and cool open roof. 

Now for the food. We split the bone in filet, and side of lobster mashed potatoes, asparagus and mushrooms. The steak was excellent! It was cooked perfectly and melted in my mouth. I really enjoyed the lobster mashed potatoes and the asparagus and mushroom were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.   We also split their famous butter cake which was so good we almost ordered a second. Next time not splitting the butter cake!

Had steak all over the world, Peter Lugar in NY, etc.  Had 2 out of 3 best steak meals of my life at Dominick's.  Both were wagyu selections - the Bone in Tomahawk Ribeye for 2 was #3 and #1 was the Wagyu Ribeye Cap.  Unreal.  Just order either medium rare, you won't ever have anything close to it.  The #2 best steak was at sister restaurant Steak 44 - the Wagyu Fillet 12 ounces of softball-sized heaven on a plate.  Don't mess around with Mastros, Flemings, Mortons, Eddie V's, blah blah blah, dude just roll up to Dominicks or Steak 44 I'm telling you their wagyu is da bomb.

My top choices are the Mignon, Wagyu, Chilean Sea Bass, and Scallops. I don't feel that the New York Strip or Ribeye has ever been tender enough, especially after several minutes. The side dishes usually have about 2+ servings (or 4 small), so if you have a party of four, you will want to choose a few sides. My favorites are the Dominick's Potatoes (Creamy, Cheesy Sliced Potatoes similar to scalloped), Corn Creme Brulee, Mac & Cheese (Italian style with Romano and Provel cheese added to the cheddar), Bacon Brussel Sprouts, and the Creamed Spinach (buttery and sweet with corn). My favorite dessert is the layered Chocolate Cake with Cherry Compote, garnished with white & dark chocolate sticks. The spectacular bar area often has a pianist playing popular songs, and they have private dining for large groups & events. The waitstaff has always been excellent, and the steaks are served sizzling on the hot plate.
Price per person: (steak, sharable side, drink & tip) $80+

I have read some of the other reviews about service, butter cake, and other items just seemed fair.  I disagree, but does all that really matter.  I came to a steakhouse for a steak and Dominick's knocked it out of the park.  

I had an 8 oz. medium rare filet mignon and it was flavorful and tender.  Actually I would say it is the best filet I have ever had.

I really wanted to try the 18 oz. bone-in filet, but that is too much steak for me in one sitting.

The only reason I rated Dominick's a 4 compared to a 5 was that personally I dig the old style feel and decor of the older steakhouses.

I have eaten steaks all around the world in some very high end restaurants, and in my opinion nothing I have had beats the wagyu filet at this place. 

The remainder of our culinary experience was very good, though nothing that can't be found at other high end restaurants. I felt that the food lacked a certain creative flair that you would typically expect to find at an establishment like this. There was nothing exceptional about the calamari we ordered and the presentation of the clams seemed kind of... well, drab. That said, Dominick's is a fine restaurant, but that is to be expected in this price range.

It was pretty hard to get to our table because there's almost no room in between tables, but no big deal. We got a bottle of the William Hill cabernet which was very reasonably priced (I think $33). The bread came in 3 options -- sea salt, garlic & cheese. We got the garlic and it was amazing, 5 huge rolls, but we only finished 2 & then took the rest home (would be great with some pasta Mmmm). Then for dinner we split the Caesar salad, I got the petit filet mignon (8oz), my boyfriend got a bone-in rib eye, and then we got 2 sides: sautéed mushrooms ; Dominick's potatoes which were like potatoes au gratin. All of it was AMAZING! The potatoes were so great, and we had leftovers of everything. I would definitely come back.	1

Perfect mix of being classy yet hip and unique.  The Crispy Shrimp & the Calamari were great starters.  The Filet and Loaded Baked Potato were superb. Great wine selection and great wine recommendations.	0

From the gorgeous rooftop pool bar to the mouth-watering food, I was very impressed. Definitely one of the best filets I have ever had - cooked to perfection - and I think the shrimp appetizer is a close second on my list of favorites. I agree with other reviewers that the sea salt bread is a must-try.. but if you're really ready to go all-out, get the new chocolate chip brioche bread pudding for dessert!!! It is HUGE and even so I was basically licking the plate until the server finally dragged it away lol. Beautiful venue, live music, great evening!	3
1472	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	Love this restaurant! Five stars for service and atmosphere. The burrata and PB&J appetizers are both delicious. If you are to choose just one, I would go with the burrata. I ordered the chilean sea bass and it was cooked to perfection.  The corn creme brûlée was sensational and the roasted brussels sprouts were delicious. The ambiance by the pool is fun and relaxing. This restaurant is worth the price if you are in north scottsdale.	1

In town on business , also anniversary, will definitely be back. 3 meat meatball appetizer ,  New York strip steak cooked to perfection , shared a giant baked potato wedge salad , corn , desert to die for and a libation list second to none. All of it comes with a pretty good price ...but worth every cent and then some. Special thanks to James our server. Spoil yourself here

1475	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	1	5	Went with friends to Dominick's for Happy Hour last night! OMG!!! My mouth is still excited about the steak and scollops! and the shrimp were delicious too!  This has to be THE BEST HAPPY HOUR in all of Scottsdale!  Very inexpensive!  And they serve the martini's in the shaker so it stays cold and as the ice melts it makes another drink to pour! If the filet on the HH menu is anything like the steak in the restaurant, then this is the VERY BEST!!! and out wait person was so nice!!!  We will go back again and again!!!	1

The food was the best.  I had the 16 oz NY Strip and it was cooked to perfection.   I also had the fried meatballs.  They were better then I could have imagined.  My wife had the Maryland Cab Cakes. She grew up in Baltimore and she said they were very very good.   The coffee was excellent.  They surprised us with a desert for our anniversary.  It was great.  Overall we had one of the best nights out in a while.  And we go out two nights a week for dinner.  We have found our new favorite steakhouse.     

PS:  The live music was great."	2
1477	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	"As long as I have lived here and been in Keirland I have never been in here. Had a guest from Miami who wanted a steak so we went and for good reason. First off they have complimentary valet which is nice and waters for when you are waiting, I mean it is Arizona so it's a nice touch and a continuance of the upscale ambience. 

We didn't have reservations and went on a Saturday night and were seated right away. I was personally it dressed the way I would normally be and was concerned I wasn't going to be able to be ""accepted"" with my red Nikes on. However not one negative look or undertone or anything but acceptance and we were seated just as any other. Which was nice, next time I will look better for myself LOL. 

We had the absolute pleasure of meeting Brad and Brett. Great guys and Brad really and I mean really took the time to chat with us, relate to us, interact and build a relationship within the timeframe he had with us. I was impressed and him being am original in Dominick's he never lost the fire or seemed burnt out. Just being personal and going the extra mile to make sure we enjoyed every second of the experience, he delivered. Thanks Brad for making it happen. Brett also did great and made sure we were taken care of and also very pleased with how they worked with each other. They get it. Yes going to a place like this I am expecting the best service but everyone knows we are people and people fail, they didn't one step at all. 

They have warm garlic butter bread in a personalized skillet and that was awesome to start. I had the medallion steal filet, lobster Mac and the noodles were money, and sweet creme brûlée sweet corn which was fantastic. The filet came on a smoking hot plate and hearing the sizzle when the sides were added just brought the experience to life. I love steal and I have been to many steakhouses in the past this one is up here. I loved every bit of it. Done and done. We had some ice cream dessert and it was a nice touch to the night. My guest also enjoyed the experience immensely. 

Brad will be the one I will come back to for sure. It's always good to have great experiences and I am very pleased."	1

The sides were delicious. The pre-bread serving just awesome. The server, she was great. A little on the $$$ side but well worth each 10 dollar bill.	1

So this past weekend we decided to come here and just as my request they seated me next to the pool. The service here has never let me down. The food has always been amazing. It was just so beautiful being able to see the clouds and stars while eating. The rooftop has a different ambiance more quiet and intimate. I cannot wait to come back again!	0
1486	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	1	1	5	Had Friday night at 7:30 reservations, and everything was ready for us when we arrived.  Place was packed!  Server Jeff was excellent, and all of the staff were professional and prompt, which is what you want and expect when spending $53 for a steak!  My wife and I each had a cocktail, and the pours were excellent.  The martini actually is almost 2 martinis.  The wine list had an excellent selection of quality wines in the $50-$75 range....sometimes hard to find in restaurants of this caliber.  The Duckhorn Pinto was excellent, as was the price at $51.  Appetizers....both the Jumbo Shrimp and the Blue Point Oysters were perfect.  Wife ordered Filet, I ordered bone in NY....both medium rare and cooked just as ordered.  Split the sides....creamed spinach and half fries/half onion strings....wonderful.  Since we noted on our reservation that this was a special occasion....17th wedding anniversary, they served a great chocolate cake with Happy Anniversary on it, and it was also excellent.  Everything was $260 plus tip, and was well worth it.  5 stars....they deserve it!	1

1488	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	1	0	5	"I've been here for the last three weeks in a row and I just love it.  The steak is cooked perfectly, the ambience couldn't be more swanky, and I just feel at home when I see the artwork of the glasses saying cheers to a great time.  Also, their pours on glasses of wine are FAT.  Well worth the $14 - $39 a glass whatever it is you may be ordering.  Stay away from the 401k though.  Spend the extra $2-$3 and get something thats not from ""California.""  The Porterhouse was amazing, best creamed spinach anywhere, and the mushrooms were perfect.  I also liked how the waiter hurried my wine to my table as soon as the steak got there!  That is a level of service reserved for the best of the best.  Finish the night off with their butter cake, and you can't go wrong.  It's not cheap, but it's truly one of life's great pleasures to be served such a spectacular meal and not have to clean up after.  Well worth the $300 price tag."	2

1493	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	4	Always an awesome dinner experience. However, I am very disappointed by their recent music change. Instead of live music in the bar area they now play a random mix. A mix that goes all across the board from lady gaga to frank Sinatra. It is really unimpressive, please switch back to the live music or at least some sort of playlist that's not as awkward!	0

We decided to celebrate our 1 year anniversary here and enjoyed it thoroughly. Calamari was fantastic! We both ordered the petit filet with 1/2 portion of sautéed mushrooms, corn and mash potatoes. What I liked most was their presentation as they brought you over and extremely hot plate with your steak on it as the food runners plated your sides in front of you onto the sizzling plate. It was nice as it kept your sides hot while you ate!

Drinks were made and delivered promptly, usually a problem at high end places like this. Server was friendly and attentive. 

Will return again

Update: my wife would like me to add their bread was delicious but we were not offered the variety of flavors the other tables were. Initial person who greeted us did not ask."	1
1495	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	4	"Super slow service to get started. We sat for over 36 minutes before we ordered our food. Seems like they were understaffed. We were thinking of walking out because it took so long just to order and we were afraid it's going to be just as long to get our food. 

Surprisingly after we finally ordered , the food came out quickly. The portion and quality was excellent. 
The bread was really good. Salad was so so. The appetizer and sides were huge and had a lot of variety. 

I will go back again soon and I hope the service will be faster next time."	0

Average steakhouse prices, but above average attentiveness of the staff. Jonathan G. really took care of us, even brought us a group desert on him! Thanks Jon!

My only criticism would be for them ot offer a grass-fed beef option, I was told all their meat comes from corn-fed cattle, sans the Wagyu."	0

I would have given it 5 stars, except for the fact that we sat by the mini-pool upstairs and the AC froze us to death. They opened the roof which my wife loved, and the air handlers were still blowing. I will definitely go back, but I won't sit by the pool ever again!	0

The service was excellent from the moment we walked through the revolving door until we got back into our cars at the complimentary valet area. To me good service is everything but good service can sometimes be all you get. Well, I think this place is well worth the money you will spend here. Everything that touched our table was top notch from the steak to the sea bass. And the atmosphere is very comfortable. Not too stuffy but not too laid back either. I thoroughly enjoyed my night here! Definitely a revisit in my future :)	0
1501	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	4	This place has great steaks! We rented a private room for a birthday last year. Everything was good, but for the price I'm not sure we would go back again. They have very similar quality steak to some more affordable steakhouses. It was fun to try it once tho, but I think ill stick with mastros. If you do go here be sure to try the chocolate cake, the size is huge and really good!	0

Oysters were Fabulous with very fresh ""atomic"" horseradish. Side dishes are very large.  Added to the ambiance a very rich feel, blue pool upstairs, open roof to let a light breeze in and a very good piano/singing talent. This is by far my favorite place to dine. If you want to impress someone, bring them here."	0

The ambiance of the restaurant was a bit dark and we had requested through a reservation that we would have liked the pool side table. Not sure what happened. 

Over all, for the price you pay it could be considered a bit too expensive but the service more than makes up for it"	0
1504	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	"Whenever there is some sort of holiday or reason to take someone out to a nice steak and seafood dinner this is the place.  I wish I could eat there once a week but it's a little pricey for that. In am a huge fan of mastros as well but  Dominick's has a really cool ambiance that appeals to me more and it's basically the same menu.

Their fresh bread basket has some really tastes breads and I would highly recommend the seafood tower which is my favorite to start or I could just fill up on the seafood tower and a salad alone.

I also recommend the shrimp Dominick which has this amazing sauce that you can also dip your bread in.

I have never has a bad cut of meat there and the sides are so delicious and they are pretty large so I am always taking home tons of leftovers.  And there is nothing better than steakhouse leftovers (except maybe cold pizza but anyway) the next day.

The butter cake is by far my favorite dessert if you still have room after everything else which is usually not the case for me.

If you are looking to impress, this is definitely the spot.  Plus the quarter is a cool place to walk around after dinner and iPic is right there to catch a movie at too."	0
1505	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	4	"Been a while since we have dined at Dominick's, so we hit it up Sat. night.

We have found that dining in the bar high top tables is the way to go, more living an better people watching. Walked in and got a nice table, more empty that we thought it would be and even at leaving at 8pm still wasn't fully crowded. Dining in the rooms is nice, but not really where the action is. 

We were greeted pleasantly and as always the service from the hostess to the bus boy is always top notch. Very accommodating. The were out of the wine I choose from the reserve list, but we found another great bottle. No biggie.

Had the steak as always and the bride had the Halibut special, both were great and seasoned perfectly. The mac & cheese is really good. Deserts were tasty, and they accommodated some changes we asked for. The coffee which is great, was only warm and not hot, again no biggie.

Its a great place to enjoy a night out, and a nice crowd with no riff raff.

Valet is the only way to go here, it's that or fight for parking around the place. Then have to fight the army of strollers and kids running around screaming. Not Dominick's fault though.

Again, glad we dined with them and will come back again."	1

This room had the intimacy and romance that we were hoping for.The staff was incredibly professional and attentive. Our needs were anticipated, and we never had to ask for a thing! Our server Anthony was very knowledgable and led us through the menu to help us make our choices.

This place was packed & rightfully so. The service is second to none. The waiter Jeff took very good care of us. The appetizers were awesome & the drinks were top shelf. They allowed to us to mix our own soft drink in the more than adequately poured glass. The steaks and seafood was first rate. The 22 oz ribeye is the way to go. Aged, seasoned & cooked perfectly. My wife had the 8 oz & was blown away. The lobster mash, baked potato, mac & cheese, asparagus & mushrooms were to die for. The sides were large enough to share with the other couple that accompanied us. For the two of us, we got out of there for $200. Well worth the cost for a beautiful experience. We have decided that Dominick's is our new favorite restaurant. We will definitely be back.	1

i feel like steakhouses are all fairly the same and this one doesn't really do anything to set itself apart. one note: sides are shareable (which is nice) so try different ones at the table.

all in a nice experience but it felt general."	3

We had a really great table overlooking the bar area.  A perfectly done and tasty calamari appetizer shared by four of us. I split a really well seasoned and tender bone in filet with my ""date"" and shared a Caesar salad with jumbo prawns.  A huge side of shoestring potatoes that  were so addicting. Two bottles of decent wine, shared delicious raspberry sorbet and butter rum cake and a hefty bill.  Special occasion restaurant or happy hour.  Pricey place and although food very good it is difficult to justify it being good enough for the cost.  However, portions are large.  Must say I did enjoy the evening and like being in that atmosphere!!!! Maybe I can justify the cost occasionally!!!"	0

We spent an evening, just us too basking in the wonderful atmosphere of Dominicks Steakhouse. I ordered the Ribeye and it melted in my mouth. The fried meatballs were good but I wouldn't order it again. The shrimp appetizer was amazing, the sauce was FANTASTIC! Service was awesome too but the steaks, OMG, so tender and full of flavor.

It's expensive. Our bill was $250 but it was a date night and we really needed to treat ourselves!!!

Oh and try the Italian Blood Martinis, HELLO BABY!!!! Order one because they give you the shaker and whats left in the shaker is the amount of another martini. Yeah baby!

1524	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	1	0	5	LOVE Dominick's! The food is equivalent to any other steakhouse i.e. Mastros, Donovan's etc. But sitting up by the pool makes it so much greater! I take all of my friends and family who are in town visiting for dinner there. Always a great experience.	1
1525	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	1	0	5	This place was well worth the money!  The ambiance was great, our server was helpful and the food was great. I highly recommend the crab and avocado appetizer, the hassleback potatoes as a side and the butter cake for dessert. Pick whichever steak you want- you will be happy!  We got to sit upstairs near the pool which was very nice. Fun times!	1

Because it's always full of life & energy...at least before 9 pm....and the food & service is outstanding.  I've dined here several times for personal & business reasons.  Each time, Dominick's delivers in the clutch.

When I'm entertaining clients, I enjoy dining in the back room on the 3rd level.  It's best suited for that scenario.  When I'm here with The Better Half and we want some privacy, then we ask to be seated anywhere but the bar area.  When TBH and I just want some appetizers and a glass of Wine or a late night drink, we sit at the bar.

Some menu items I've had here:

Iceberg Wedge Salad, $10.95
Tomato & Mozzarella, $12.95
Fried Meatballs Appetizer, $14.95

Petite Filet Mignon (8oz), $41.95
Filet Mignon (12oz), $47.95
Mashed Potatoes, $9.95
Au Gratin Potatoes, $13.95
Creamed Sweet Corn, $9.95

The Salads are pretty hearty portions, so be prepared.  The Bleu Cheese Dressing on the Wedge Salad is very good and rich.  If you're hungry, split the Meatballs Appetizer....it's very good, but I don't recommend having it by yourself.

Simply put, the Filet is awesome.  Depending on my hunger level, I will either get the petite or the regular size.  They cook it to your preference.  I like it Medium-Well.

Their sides are enough to easily feed 2 or 3 people.  TBH and I usually share an order of Mashed Potatoes or Au Gratin.  When I'm dining with clients, I usually get 2 or 3 for the table so they can sample them....the Sweet Corn is amazing.

Their Wine selection is excellent....we've had so many good ones here.

The service is outstanding.  In 10+ visits here, I've never had bad service.

Some notes:
Although there's not really a ""dress code"", I've heard that they won't seat people who are not dressed appropriately.  Shorts & flip-flops, t-shirts, jeans, etc....they'll probably tell you that there aren't any available tables....that's hearsay, but I'm passing it along so there are no surprises.  I've never showed up here dressed casual, so I don't have personal experience with it.

And a $10 cocktail menu that had a few doubles listed and they bring you the whole shaker. We enjoyed the Steak and Gorganzola sandwhich, Fried meatballs and Calamari. The appetizers were very hearty and plentiful. Overall the happy hour menu was a real good deal. A little crowded and crazy but typical for a happy hour.

From the moment we walked into the door everything was 1st class.  The food was so wonderful and hot and fresh and flavorful and the staff was just as exceptional.
When the meal arrived it was like a fine, orchestrated dance.  One server after another brought out the different dishes and offered them to everyone at the table.

1537	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	4	"I enjoyed an absolutely delicious meal at Dominick's with a large group of friends and family. They have a great menu - any size of steak you can imagine from filet mignon to tomahawks the size of a cricket bat. The sides and some of the appetizers are meant to be shared family-style. Great place to come for a drink and enjoy live music in their beautifully-decorated bar, with their extensive wine and cocktail menus.

Overall our service was very good. However, my ONLY point for improvement was that the server commented that he was under-tipped which was actually not the case. I felt that this was in poor taste to openly comment to customers that their tip was too low, regardless of the fact that we had left a substantial tip."	1
1538	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	13	9	5	"I've walked by Dominick's many of time but never really had a desire to visit. Anyways, my son gave me a gift certificate for Father's Day. So I decided to have an early Father's Day dinner. 

When we walked in I could smell its fancy. Staff dress really nice, dark, pop music playing(I think). We were taken to the main dining area and they had a small marble stairs. Very nice.  The hostess brought us to our table and seated us. We sat for a minute or two without menus (can you say awkward). Never been to a place like this before. Anyways, the waiter brings us the menus and makes sure we get our drink orders and bread basket. Our waiter was Geoff and he went over the menu and was very knowledgable. Very impressive. 

We started off with the bread basket. I usually don't write about the bread basket but all I have to say is WOW. You get a pretzel bread (so good. Excellent), sour dough, bread sticks, and red onion Focaccia. The focaccia was soft and sweet. I loved it. Also, remember I really don't like onions but this was really good. 

I ordered the 22oz Bone In Ribeye. My wife ordered the Filet of Sole Francese and we got the side dishes of Sautéed Spinach with Garlic and Mac & Cheese. The ribeye was something special. It was so tender, juicy, cooked perfectly, and melted in my mouth. It was sooo good. Also, be aware that the always state that their steak plate comes out at 500 degrees and it was hot. Sizzling hot. My wife had the Sole and it was good. It tasted okay. Nothing special. They do give you two large filets. One thing that stood out is after they served our meals, they asked us if they can serve us our side dishes. Very nice touch. The spinach was very good and the Mac & Cheese was good too. The main meal and bread basket was so big that we couldn't even finish the side dishes. Yum yum good. 

We were stuffed but left a little room for dessert. You always got to leave room for dessert. So we tried their signature dessert which was a hot Butter cake with vanilla bean ice cream, homemade whip cream, and Carmel syrup. Really good. Soft and buttery (of course) with a nice sweet taste. The ice cream had something different. Couldn't put a finger on it but was so darn good. Excellent dessert. 

The service was excellent. Our waiter checked on us just enough, our water cups were refilled all the time, dishes were removed in a timely manner, and they boxed up our food too. 

I really enjoyed Dominick's. They claim to be  focus on Midwestern Beef so definitely try their steaks. So if you really want a great steak with a nice atmosphere then Dominick's might be that place. Just be aware of the prices. It's at the high end, but food is great, service excellent. Enjoy but be ready to open your wallet."	14
1539	3p4M5be6uc1S78TO62gmOg	0	0	5	The service was amazing, starting off with complementary valet. The bread serves at the beginning of the courses was soft and warm. Our waiter was very informative and guided us well. The serving size of my ribeye was perfect. It was cooked to perfection. The sides we shared we're bought to feed all of us. Dessert was exquisite and rich! I ordered a chocolate layered cake, super decadent! All-in-all, I was impressed and will return again.	0

I don't have drinks.
Or appetizers.
And I don't eat one of their signature cuts of beef. 
Only the warm butter cake.

This cake is served on an oval platter.
And on this platter is a six-inch long, two-inch thick, oval shaped butter cake cooked to golden browned perfection. 
Also on the platter is a small lake of warmed caramel sauce, a generous dollop of freshly whipped cream, and a scoop of softened, french vanilla ice cream.

In concert with all its accoutrements, each mouthful of this buttery delight will have you looking forward to the next with so much enthusiasm, you'll find yourself shiftily speeding your shoveling gait so as to out-consume your date by at least a five spoonful margin.

I say forget all those other useless calories from drinks and entrees and shoot your entire calorie wad on a dessert so sumptious, it's likely the nearest thing to heaven you'll ever experience."	3

My husband picked Dominick's because of the great reviews on Yelp.  We had a private room upstairs and it was called poolside dining.  The ""pool"" was about 6 inches deep and it was a pretty decent size, where if you weren't looking at where you're walking, you'll easity fall in. 

Our menu was preordered so we had the following served samily style except for our steak.
Caesar Salad - Very good, I loved the dressing.
Fried Calamari - Very good, not a lot of batter and the marinara sauce was delicious
Crab Cakes - Not my favorite.  It had more bread crumbs than crab.
Meatballs - I highly recommend!!!  Lots of flavor and good meaty texture, it would have been perfect over pasta. 
Bone-in Ribeye - it was cooked Medium Rare and it melted in my mouth.  The steak was still sizzling when it got to my table.  
Sweet Peas - Delicious.  it was cooked perfectly.  It was crunchy but didn't taste raw. 
Lobster Mac N Cheese - Just Order, that's all I have to say.
Sauteed Mushrooms - You can never go wrong with mushrooms!!!

I highly recommnend this place, I love it even more because it was in an outdoor upscale mall :) :)  The perfect paring :) :)"	3

We enjoyed the Calamari and Shrimp app and thought we had died and gone to heaven-crunchy, generous, soulful seafood.  We also indulged in the steak and scallops-which were delish but I wanted a few more scallops to make me swoon. To top off all of this yumminess are the over the top yeast rolls, served piping hot and buttery in a cast iron pan.  No butter needed! The cocktails and wine are a large pour and expertly mixed.  We love to find happiness here!	2

I made reservations for my boyfriends 31st Birthday and we were seated up stairs next to the pool which was different from any other restaurant and a nice touch. When we started to order the appetizer our waiter said ""is this your first time here""? In a very snooty way. I guess we ordered the appetizer wrong?! So immediately I was annoyed because it's unnecessary. The place was really loud and there was drunk idiotic people screaming and getting into the pool all around us. Thankfully the manager put a stop to it. We both ordered the filet which was amazing with the crab mac and cheese side. My boyfriend also received a complimentary desert which was great it made the night a bit more special. Over all the place is nice, I am giving it 4 starts due to the noise level and our snooty waiter."	0

Husband and I both had steaks which were the best we've ever had and the side dishes were amazing - snap peas were bright green, crispy, and tasty, and the hasselback potato was perfectly sliced and cooked- crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. We topped it off with the Chocolate molten cake with vanilla ice cream- which should be its own food group. Will definitely come back the next time we are in the area.	0

1560	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	1	0	5	I've always been a big fan of Chef Branden Levine's succulent and unique dishes. Sel definitely takes his impeccable skills at its highest level. All the dishes were excellent, from the quality, freshness, presentation and taste. Every ingredient is palate worthy. The Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras is a must try. It comes in a generous portion and is just a party of delicious flavors.  Another favorite is  the panko crusted Aslaskan halibut. The fish is so fresh that it melts in your mouth and is just simply divine. The ambiance and location is perfect. Set amidst the heart of Old Town Scottsdale's art district, it offers such a great experience to the diner with a spacious patio dining area to boot. The cocktails are amazing! I would say that they are the best that I have ever had. My favorite is the Baiser Francais with its twist of the flowery taste of the chamomile syrup as well as The Harry Nilsson with just the right amount of coconut liqueur to give that refreshing and savory taste. Sel has a great staff who have all been highly experienced in the restaurant world. Meet celebrity chef Branden Levine and see who and what everyone has been talking about!	3

1562	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	2	0	5	Took my out of town foodie friend here and we weren't disappointed.  The food was amazing. Rather than opting for the sampling menu we did the a la carte option with each of us trying different items.  The octopus ceviche was amazing. The corn panne cotta was good but the pork belly was divine.  The scallops we very slightly over cooked but delicious.  The duck breast and potatoes was amazing.  I was disappointed that they were out of the halibut but the Chilean sea bass was a decent replacement. I'm in love with the horseradish cauliflower. To finish the night we had a strawberry shortcake that just melted in your mouth.  The waiter was so personable and great.  The only down side to the meal was not in anyone's control and the credit card system was down and it took them an hour to figure out a replacement.  While they didn't offer anything while waiting when asked they did provide a complimentary glass of while for us for the wait.  Overall this was an excellent dining experience.	1
1563	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	0	0	4	Came here for my husband's birthday, had the caramelized beet polenta and braised pork belly for my 1st and 2nd course and these were both very good. the compressed melon salad for 3rd course which was phenomenal just packed with flavor. the duck breast for my 4th course which was very good and the foie gras which was absolutely delicious. my husband had the filet mignon and said it was the best steak he's ever had. we topped of dinner with tiramisu and strawberry shortcake  for dessert and that was just melt in your mouth delicious. the atmosphere was decent, small cozy restaurant. I'd say they could turn up some music a tad louder, it was a little too quiet for me and I feel like the whole room could listen to our conversation. the waiters were pleasant and nice but all seemed timid and a kind of awkwardly reciting the menu from a script by memory the best they could..a couple of the waiters had stains on their pants which was a little tacky for high end restaurant  and I did find a hair in my duck breast which I quickly just picked out and kept eating cause hey the food was good but I can see how some people might be bothered by that. Overall I give 4 stars for great food and friendly service and I would recommend this place to others to try.	0
1564	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	1	0	5	"What an amazing meal from start to finish!  I love Hillstone and Flemmings and Steak 44, but this restaurant blows those away in terms of fanciness, chefiness, and yes, price.  Our dinner for two without wine was around $200. So, maybe not an every week option, but for something special, it was definitely worth it.

The dinners are prix fixe. Some of the highlights  were the Romanesco soup which was soft, velvety, and like nothing I've ever had before. Next course was the Cesar salad, made with  brussle sprouts frites and applewood bacon crisps-- probably the best salad ever anywhere.  Dinner and dessert were also amazing. One high point was that my mom has food allergies  and ""food preferences"" and they were more than willing to accommodate her requests. 

We had a wonderful and memorable meal and despite the price, we both agreed it was worth it!"	6

1568	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	2	2	4	Sel was superb from start to finish. The wait staff and hosts are attentive and friendly, and really took the time to explain each dish. I had the vegetarian tasting menu. The first item, a mushroom and lentil emulsion, was creamy and had delightful flavor notes in each bite. The potsticker and tofu gnocchi were also excellent, prepared with a lot of different elements. The only item I did not like was the salad. It had a stale custard crouton with run-of-the-mill overly dressed greens and tasted like a salad you might get at Denny's. I enjoyed the dessert immensely, which was a marzipan shortcake. I will definitely be back, as they change their menu every two weeks and always have a vegetarian tasting menu. All around a wonderful experience.	3
1569	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	0	0	5	This review is long overdue, but well worth it. The food here was great, but even more so, the service was impeccable.  Our water glasses were always full, the cocktails were perfect, and I swear our server was more delighted and excited about the flavors we were going to experience than we were. It would have been a great meal anyway, but the people who were taking care of us and going to extra mile to explain everything with nothing less than pure enthusiasm -- everything from the ambiance of the restroom to the how the citrus flavor in the side dish was achieved -- was the thing that will make it unforgettable. Well worth the trip.	1

1573	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	1	0	5	"What a great new addition to the Valleys finest restaurants. Although only open for a couple weeks we enjoyed an impeccable meal on par with Kai and Binkleys. Our meals were beautifully presented with great taste to match. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and the service first rate. When Sel gets reviewed and the word gets out reservations will be hard to come by. 
Our mains, the succulent Halibut and perfect filet were just that - perfect! We shared the one dessert offered and it was decadent, a strawberry marzipan shortcake.
Sel has become our go to fine restaurant for impressing our out-of-town guests, or for any other excuse we can make to get there."	2
1574	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	4	0	5	I think this is one of the three best meals we've had in Phoenix, and we've lived here 13 years. We went for our anniversary and had the 4-course prix fixe; I opted for the vegetarian options and my husband had the meat versions. We agreed it was all delicious, innovative, and beautifully presented. My favorite was the stuffed squash blossom first course. Or maybe the third course, compressed peach salad with goat cheese. How to pick?! They brought out a marzipan/strawberry/salted caramel concoction at the end that was to die for. $70 per person ($60 vegetarian 4-course option). We will go back.	4

Loved the squash blossom relleno and the bisque, but it was all excellent. Sat at the bar. Very cool ambience there and you can see into the kitchen. Small - intimate and hip. Would definitely go again.	1

This new restaurant stunned with phenomenal tastes, textures, and presentation, all in a very classy and upbeat environment. The head chef is from highly acclaimed Cafe Monarch, and he has cooked overseas and competed on TV with Bobby Flay; really impressive! But again the proof was in the pudding, and his inventive dishes with incredible tastes really surprised!

Loved the outdoor seating area in Old Town, and sophisticated look inside. The cocktails are WOW, but you have to try it all to see for yourself!"	2

DELICIOUS! We both loved our meals. it was a Pre Fixe dinner & being a bumpkin I was a little intimidated by some of the offerings but my husband assured me it was all going to be delicious and he was right.
The roasted sweet corn soup is mouthwatering! The compressed melon salad was amazing!
For the Entree I had the Duck. I have had duck MANY times but this was truly the best I have ever had. 
The atmosphere was very metropolitan and we loved it. 
I would absolutely highly recommend Sel and don't be a chicken and order the a - la - carte! haha."	2

1582	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	22	9	5	"FINALLY tried Sel. I had some friends visiting from Denver this past weekend and was trusted with picking the Saturday night spot for dinner. We were early for our reservation so we sat at the bar for a drink. This place is pretty small but the decor is incredible. It was modern and sexy, bright white walls and bar top offset with a purple fuzzy back wall. It truly was beautiful to look at. I learned that Sel translates to ""salt"" in English after thinking to myself ""are those really mini salt shakers sticking out of the tile wall in the restroom?"" The level of detail in the decor transcended to the food preparation and presentation as well. 

The Four course Prix Fixe menu was fabulous and interesting. Between the four of us we had:

First Course:: Wild Mushroom Ragu ""Crouton"" and Blue Point Oysters. 
:: The goat cheese mousse and truffle lemon emulsion were harmonious and added a great tang to the mushroom Ragu. 

Second Course:: Rabbit Confit Ravioli and Red King Crab
:: The king crab was my favorite of the two, composed partly of wasabi caviar and foie gras sauce you cannot go wrong 

Third Course:: Winter greens 
:: Bacon and candy stripe beets, need I say more?

Fourth Course:: Crispy Skin Wild Striped Bass, Hemp Seed Crusted Scallops, Lone Mountain Wagyu Hanger Steak, and Grilled Octopus
:: The squid ink risotto and sweet chili chimichurri took the octopus dish to the next level. It was absolutely perfect! The waygu was cooked to a perfect medium rare with the blood orange hollandaise and banyuls beef stock reduction complimenting the flavor of the meat. My friends said their bass and scallops were very good as well.

Supplement:: Seared Hudson Valley Foie Gras
:: Melt in your mouth good! Just how it should be

This was not a cheap meal, but it was a celebration with friends and we found it to be worth every penny."	29

1584	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	1	0	5	"We came for our anniversary and had a wonderful time. The restaurant is fairly small, and has really neat decor. We did the 4-course menu, and everything we had was delicious. There was a nice progression of the courses leading up to the last course. The compressed peach salad was so light and refreshing and perfect right before the fourth course. I had the filet and my wife had the duck. The filet was so tender and melted in my mouth. My favorite part of the dish however was the morel mushrooms - they were so flavorful and I wish I had more on my plate! My wife had the duck, and absolutely loved it! Presentation was really beautiful, and we really enjoyed the waiter describing each dish when it was served. 

After the four courses were so full and didn't think we'd order desert, but for our anniversary they gave us complementary dessert. We chose the strawberry marzipan shortcake, no surprise, it was amazing.

Overall, the food was fantastic and it was a perfect atmosphere and experience for celebrating our anniversary!"	0

We enjoyed the 4 course prix fixe menu which included a crispy jerusalem artichoke with corn on the cob, butternut squash soup, beet, tomato and mozzarella salad, and maple leaf duck with rapini...my mouth is watering reliving this moment through writing my review.  Nice atmopshere, great service and high quality food.  I highly recommend starting your experience with a barbara jean cocktail up...so tasty!	3
1588	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	1	0	5	"If I could give Sel 6 stars, I would. The food was perfection, the wine pairing was superb with each selection highlighting the dish (and more than worth the extra cost as you get 5 pours with 4 courses). The staff was friendly yet allowed us to enjoy each course and what ended up being an almost 4 hour meal with limited interruption. 

We chose this restaurant to celebrate our wedding anniversary, and we felt spoiled! 

I'm sure the whole menu is delicious (and it rotates for added variety), but the caliber of skill and taste would suggest that it doesn't matter what you order. We had perfectly cooked scallops, duck like I've never had before (skin cooked separately and added back on as a duck bacon/burnt ends garnish), and perfectly wonderful tiramisu with vanilla bean ice cream. The first three courses were tremendously delicious as well, and I will be dreaming of both the duck main dish and the pressed peach and burrata salad for a very long time."	0

The food was excellent with the exception of the spring roll appetizer.  Although the wait staff was pleasant, we felt they were lacking somewhat in their professionalism as well as in their knowledge of the food and wine.  At times the staff busied themselves cleaning glasses instead of attending to the small details (refilling wine etc).  We are hoping it was just an off night and will give it another try in a couple months since they have only been open four weeks."	0

1592	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	2	1	5	"We came to Sel to celebrate our anniversary, and had an absolutely flawless experience!!  If you enjoy fine dining then you will absolutely love Sel.  They provide you a 4-course menu that you can add onto if you'd like.  We decided to try one of everything (if there were 2 options) for the first 3 courses, then had the duck and the halibut for the main courses.  Every singe dish was impeccable - the flavors were outstanding, and the presentation was gorgeous.  I felt bad digging in and ruining the artistry of each dish (although not that bad, since it was delicious and needed to be eaten, lol).

The service here was also above and beyond.  The hostess greeted us and wished us a happy anniversary.  The waiter gave us thorough descriptions of all the dishes, and even sent out the bartender and sommelier without us needing to request them for some drink questions we were mulling over.  They even noticed when a gentleman starting playing his acoustic guitar outside of the restaurant, and turned off the music on the patio so it would't compete with the other music.  Having that wherewithal truly made the experience even more pleasant.

We will 100% be coming back here for another special occasion.  Thank you Sel for making our anniversary even more special! :)"	3
1593	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	1	0	5	I went with a party of 6 last night for an anniversary dinner. From soup to nuts it was a fantastic experience. This is the kind of restaurant where you don't need to understand the menu. Just order and enjoy. The chef has you covered. So yes...the salad might have anchovy dressing and that might sound like fish salad but seriously Chef Levine will not serve you fish salad. It was amazing and I don't even like anchovies. The staff were all professional and helpful. The presentation was beautiful. The courses came out perfectly timed so we didn't feel rushed to finish one thing before moving on to the next. I'm already looking forward to our next dinner there.	1

We started with a bottle of bubbly and the went for the four course wine pairing dinner. Everything was awesome. Much to my surprise, the chilled cantaloupe with poached lobster may have stole the show. (I can't stand cantaloupe, but this was perfectly seasoned and may have converted me.). I'm a huge duck breast and grilled octopus fan and both too were amazing. The wines were perfectly paired. Can't wait to go back with friends to see Chef Branden and Josh again.	1

We did the 4 course prix fixe and you should too. Especially if you want a starter and an entree. Doesn't make $ sense not to.

I'm afraid this review will suck, frankly, because the dishes were so fancy and there's no way I can remember ingredients. All I can go off of is taste and everything is phenomenal! The Jerusalem artichoke was delicious! I had never had one and the mini corn cob was topped with some sort of crunchy salty goodness. Again, no clue what is was, I suck. The summer salad was good, flavorful tomatoes, a lovely soft cheese and beets. 

The butternut squash soup is the best butternut squash soup that I have ever had. I'm not a bss expert but this was next level. I wish I had more but probably would have made myself sick overdoing it.

The dorade was very good, skin crispy and yummy. Loved the cippolini onions that the fish was served on top of. Would love to figure out how to make those at home. Desserts were very good as well.

It's a small space, I don't know if you could eat there on a weekend night without a reservation? Small bar. Cool, clean atmosphere."	4

We would absolutely return -- the food is simply amazing and the ambience/décor is a fun, chic vibe.  Service was excellent, just the restaurant was super busy and the four course menu took nearly 3 hours with some large waits between courses.  

They change the menu every 2 weeks which keeps it fresh and exciting.  We had  an amazing oxtail appetizer followed by the most wonderful coconut milk based squash soup.  The duck entrée was superb.  

To their credit, they also acknowledged the slow kitchen and offered us free dessert.  The chef also made a point to visit all the tables at the end of the evening.

My sweetie's smooth texture of filet was amazing.

This restaurant has a fixed menu and while that normally might feel limiting, I believe there's something for everyone (we dined with friends who are sometimes fussy). So check out the menu. We did the wine pairings. 

Service was very attentive. They told us they were short some help in the kitchen and made sure the wine pours kept us happy!

My husband and I went to Sel last Thursday for our 26th anniversary and we're still commenting to everyone we know about how great this place is. You can tell from the taste of the food and presentation of each dish that the chef prepares the food with love and care. And Mike, who was both our waiter and the Sommelier, is fantastic! The wine pairings made each of the 4 courses a true experience for the senses. Sel is our new favorite local restaurant.	0

The waitstaff are very  professional and courteous in their recommendations, which really helped set the tone for the entire evening. The cocktail menu is fresh and interesting and best of all, it pairs nicely with the food. We opted for the prix fixe menu and were not disappointed; if you can get the foie gras add-on, do it, it is well worth it. The stuffed squash blossom and chilled cucumber soup were so welcome and refreshing to eat on a 113 degree day that I hope the chef keeps variations of these on his menu for the entire summer. The duck breast I ordered was scored and perfectly cooked- delicious soaked in its jus. Oh yes, and definitely save room for dessert! on this menu they offered a strawberry marzipan shortcake that really puts all other shortcake to shame. 

I expect that in a very short time this restaurant will be difficult to get into, so we will be visiting as often as we can this summer."	4

Sel is a course meal so you'll most likely be there for about 2 1/2 hours. The food though is amazing. Really intense flavors, and small dishes. The course is about 70$ but the separation and timing of the food is well worth it.	0

1620	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	0	0	4	We have a win. Sceptical as we were with a newborn  (less than a year old) we had to see what the  buzz is about. I couldn't get a prime  time reservation so opted for an early 5:45 dinner. When we arrived, we were the only guests. The restaurant never got to 50% capacity until 7. This irritated us until the owner visited the table and explained it is a kitchen size/production issue. Other than me being a baby about dinner time it was a 5 star experience. I recommend the prix fix as the menu is limited. Appetizers, supplements, main course es and deserts are creative, fresh, and delicious. Parking is tough but it is downtown with lots of tourists and galleries. Highly recommend.	0
1621	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	4	4	4	"I cannot think of a better place to host a girl's night out. Sel is beautifully decorated, offered excellent customer service and they serve delicious/well decorated 4 course meals for $70 per person. The presentation is truly amazing. 

I've made a reservation for the 7 of us and the table was ready as soon as we walked in. We were immediately welcome by our server. As the girls came in one by one, he paid close attention to our table making sure we got our drinks/order as soon as possible. Since I had a destinated driver for the night, I ordered the Barbara Jean ($14: Fords Gin, Giffard Strawberry Liqueur, Chamomile Syrup, Lemon Juice) that was highly recommended by our waiter. It has just the right amount of sweet and I definitely enjoyed it. For my 4 course meals, I ordered a Smoked Lobster Stuffed Squash Blossom (roasted corn puree, pickled Bing cherry), Yellow Tomato Gazpacho, Copper river salmon Gravlaz Salad and Duck breast for main entrée. Everything was delicious except the Yellow Tomato Gazpacho. I simply am not used to having my soup served cold, but my friends all seem to like it. The duck dish was so tender, juicy and delicious and I will definitely order that again. I also tried a bite of my friend's filet Mignon. It was juicy and tender. For dessert, I ordered the strawberry short cake. It was a bit too sweet for my taste and I honestly don't care for it much. I wish they have more choices in dessert, but that was the only choice they offer last night. 

Overall, my experience here was amazing! I made a reservation 3 weeks ago for a table of 12 (before 5 girls dropped out on me). They called me the day before asking if we were ok to seat us in the patio area. Needless to say, I was not happy to be asked one day before our reservation. Nevertheless, they were nice about it and ended up seating us in the best area at the restaurant. With that said, keep in mind this restaurant isn't for big group setting due to its size. If you have a party bigger than 8, I'll recommend you to go somewhere else. This is, however, a great place for a date night with your love one. 

Thanks again for the wonderful evening Sel."	5

The mint pea purée squash appetizer was by far the best ap I have ever had.  The corn chowder soup was so complex and delicious as well. My husband enjoyed the scallops and I had the vegetarian option of Sherpa milk ravioli.  We were stuffed and I almost said no to desert. What a mistake that would have been.  The strawberry shortcake caramel desert was AMAZING!  The sea salt in the caramel exploded in my mouth.  Best dinner I have ever had!	3

The food was delicious. The tasting menu is paced perfectly, and dishes were all delicious. Chef Levine is very creative with not only flavors, but presentation as well. Wine parings were also spot-on as well and I recommend getting them. 
It is located in Scottsdale Art walk area. Great for a stroll after dinner or people watching while eating.

If you were miss Binkley's in Cave Creek since it closed, come here. You wont miss it any more I assure you. Were truly fortunate to have a place this wonderful,  in this city."	0

If you're looking for a well prepared meal with exotic choices, Sel will fill your tummy with the ultimate happiness!"	3
1629	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	16	7	4	"Had a lovely girl's night out at Sel. The interior is modern with a white theme to echo the restaurant's name which is ""salt"" in French. The menu changes every few weeks (I think every 2 weeks the server said), so eating here will typically be a new experience each time you go.

They offer a 4 course prix fixe meal for $70 as well as a la carte items. If you go with the prix fixe you will have a choice of your appetizer and main entree while the soup and salad will be only one choice. I went with the prix fixe, choosing the lobster stuffed squash blossom and halibut with green curry cassoulet. The soup was a yellow tomato gazpacho and the salad was a gravlax vinaigrette salad with mixed greens.

Each course was thoughtfully prepared, with a beautiful presentation. Seasoning was perfect, and the combination of textures and flavors of each dish was excellent. My favorite of the prix fixe menu was the lobster stuffed squash blossom. The delicate taste of the squash blossom went well with the lobster meat, and the breaded crispy outer layer of the blossom was perfect. I also have to say this is the best gazpacho I've had by far. It was a smooth, refreshing cold soup and the sweet peach gratinee in the center provided a great contrast with the more acidic taste of the tomatoes. The main entree was lovely, with a tender, perfectly cooked halibut and exotic tasting ""cassoulet"" with the addition of green curry.

Service was excellent. Plates were taken away and water was refilled as needed. Our server was friendly and warm. 

Even the water here is quite delicious, as it is steeped with cucumber and mint. I'll have to try this at home!

Dessert was a heavenly strawberry shortcake made with marizpan, a quenelle of vanilla bean gelato, caramel drizzle and balsamic vinegar. 

The four course meal was just right for me. I'm glad I shared the dessert because I don't think I'd be able to finish the whole thing if I hadn't.

The only thing that bothered me was when the filet mignon dishes came out for the people at our table, each piece was differently sized. My friend sitting across from me got a significantly smaller piece of filet compared to her neighbor. If we are paying $70 for our meal you bet each dish needs to be consistent and have the same amount of food.

Overall 4.5/5."	20

Every course was something to talk about with unexpected flavors and interesting pairings of equally important ""main event"" and garnish. The first course of Langoustine Tartar offered maybe the best bites I've ever had in my life. And the desserts were phenomenal. Everything at this little gem of a restaurant was super killer. Really a must eat at restaurant."	0

1633	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	0	0	5	Everything is excellent. Great ingredients, unique menu and always changing. Refined and quite tasty but not too pretentious.  This is a great place for a special occasion, the food more than makes up for the location (which isn't bad by any means, but it's not on a mountain overlooking the valley :-)) .	1
1634	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	29	19	4	"Great new restaurant with lots of potential.

They serve very good food in a nice ambiance. I liked they used fresh flowers everywhere. It has a lot of upscale feeling to it, good place to come for good food.

They serve prix fixe 4 course meals for about $70. Recently added option for wine pairing for $40. All the food served had a nice taste and I enjoyed all the dishes served. I thought about describing each meal but the menu changes weekly. 

Ingredients are carefully picked by the chef and I especially enjoyed figs in salad, and ferns used for side of scallops. Unfortunately, when the server server said 15-year aged balsamic vinegar on the side of the strawberry shortcake, I licked a sauce a bit with excitement with my finger but it didn't have the texture and taste of what I know of 15-year aged balsamic vinegar. 

When I left for bathroom, I saw my coffee ready, but when I came out, it was still there. I would have enjoyed freshly made hot coffee but the server let it sit for a while. For his credit, he decided not to charge for coffee. 

Wine pairing - I had to look at him twice and he asked if we wanted fresh glass each time. Some were good but others were not that good. I couldn't tell that buttery chardonnay he described. Perhaps I don't drink enough white wine to know that.  In a way, wine pairing was good that it was only $40 per person, and small amount of wine is served for each meal. 

Food was great, server was friendly.  I enjoyed the food but next time, I think I would just order a bottle of wine, and not go for wine pairing."	30
1635	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	6	0	5	Our group of four enjoyed two courses each, a la carte, and the waiter was kind enough to bring side plates so we could share.  The filet mignon was exceptional, and the duck and gnocchi were delicious too.  The butternut squash soup and seasonal salad were very good.  I would have expected a bit more to the salad, though the ingredients were thought out and nicely arranged on the plate. Won't go into detail as the menu changes weekly.  Bear in mind there are no freezers at this establishment, just refrigerators, so the food is as fresh as it gets.  I really enjoyed the strawberry shortcake; do not expect angel food cake.  The cake is much grainier and dense. Delicious!  Nice wine list and super gracious service.	4

The service was top notch and the food was just simply put, amazing. We indulged in two bottles of champagne - a beer each and ordered the 4 course meal! This restaurant is a gem and can not wait to be back!	1
1637	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	0	0	5	We were actually looking to go to Cafe Monarch that evening, but there was no availability so I thought we'd try this place out.   The decor appealed, as did the quiet looking location down the street from one of our favorite bars (The Beverly).  Despite the fact the menu changes frequently, they had the tasting menu posted online, and it struck all the right chords with my wife and I.  The setting was beautiful, and the waitstaff was extremely knowledgeable and attentive.  The criticism about noise in this place seems a little undue, I thought it was fine and vibrant, not overwhelming.  Now, on to the food: amazing!  They clearly care about the ingredients, the details, and executed everything perfectly.  The wine pairings were spot on (and generously poured!), and this ranks in the top 3 meals I've had in the valley.  Was it pricey?  Yes, but worth it.  Great for a splurge or significant night out, and the chef and staff clearly care.	0
1638	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	0	0	5	Holy Cow!  Stunning meal. By far the best Filet I have ever eaten. Brandon (chef and owner) and Josh (Som and Bar Master) are in a league of their own. It all starts with Brandon's skill infusing flavors and mixing textures and creating sauces that are second to none. The service was Platinum Level. Josh was super enthusiastic about all things food and drink. The ambiance was perfect for a date. The music was pure Rhythm or MoTown (my favs) out of the 70'a. The sound dampening in the dining room made for easy conversation throughout the night. This place is a hidden jewel in downtown Scottsdale.	1

1641	kwi2TiPbCAVHsBNkEkZjVA	2	1	5	"my friends credit card was left after dinner, he called the next day and they said they had it. then he went back for it and they said they couldn't find it.. later that day  we found out it was stolen and used for 300$ at frys electronics and subway for $70.  

Wow! This place really came through. Everything was executed perfectly. The service was wonderful and I had a very knowledgeable server. I opted for the four course prefix for $70. I felt like I was stealing from the place it was such a good value. I also did the $40 additional wine pairing with prior request for a big red which the amazing server took great caution of and served only the greatest wines.  Honestly this was one of the best value meals I've ever had in my life. Four courses plus full pour wines for under $120 is just unheard of especially at this amplitude of food. Good for you Brandon levine! You really know how to bring it!! And to all the servers there, you're very knowledgeable and wonderful!! Good job SEL, you're amazing and you've got a great team! I hope Scottsdale keeps you going!"	3

The staff are very friendly and attentive. Fantastic arrangement, so a bunch of groups can be eating/lounging at the same time. There is a sun porch, main seating area, living room-like area, and seating neat the buffet. Overall, the lounge is extremely clean, well manicured, and has fresh flowers switched out weekly (we ran into the florist one afternoon)."	0

Service level is remarkable facilitating many of my business / social meetings. Staff couldn't be more warm and engaging. Breakfast food is fresh and nicely presented with appealing apps in the eve and a well stocked cocktail bar.

The staff, once again, make this place remarkable.

much! The service here is remarkable! From the moment that we arrived, we were escorted straight from the main lobby down to the Fairmont Gold Lounge to check in, in there we were welcomed by their wonderful staff. Our whole stay was very relaxing as we never encountered any hassle thanks to their amazing service! they really go above and beyond to make sure any of our requests were fulfilled! We haven't even left the resort yet but we already made plans on coming back in a month!"	1

A changing hot menu daily with great staples like smoked salmon and the fixings for Bagel and Lox, meats, cut fruit and berries, Muesli, cereals and such.  The highlight for me and my husband was the oatmeal creme brule.  
Additionally, the staff was friendly, warm, welcoming, extremely knowledgeable, helpful and a joy to be around.  Couldn't ask for better pampering than having the Lounge available with its staff to make our stay amazing!"	5
