Since there were limited options in the terminal, and I was looking for a quick breakfast before my flight, I asked for a simple oatmeal (noted on the menu with berries, walnuts, and brown sugar). The cashier was extremely disinterested in taking my order and yelled to the back to ask if they even had the oatmeal. Once confirmed - she turned to me and said ""we're out of the berries"". Alright - I was fine with that and proceeded with the oatmeal order. Sit down at my gate- opened my oatmeal container - to find a soupy mess of oatmeal and walnuts floating in a goopy sugar slop. I returned to the cash register to request an alternative item (trust me - not something I commonly do - avoid awkward confrontation whenever possible) - where the cashier had to get her manager to override the order in the system - as I asked for a bagel and cream cheese in place of my oatmeal slop. The replacement items were as equally unimpressive - and I wish I would have taken the time to eat a lower cost, better quality meal at home. Although I've had good experiences with airport meals in the past - this was not one of them."	0.0

The food we had (Cisco Kid Sandwich & Blutos Breakfast Bagel) were actually good as far as airport food goes.

They were out of chicken sandwiches, so I got a burger and fries. Everything was pretty good except they use the tiniest little burger patties. You'd need a double stack to almost get a normal amount of beef.

According to our local newspaper and other publications the Chicken Sandwich from Nocawich is suppose to be a top sandwich of Metro Phoenix so we wanted to try it.

I received a squashed sandwich with slightly burnt chicken that was very drippy with a pool of white liquid. I bravely take a bite and it has a weird taste I can't identify. I DON'T think this sandwich was made right. Seemed like they turned up the oil really high and it didn't cook at the correct temperature. Curst is slightly burnt, not crisp..no flavors but oil and almost burnt.... The pickle seems good and the slaw seems fresh. The chicken is edible but this sandwich doesn't really taste good expect for the pickle.

They don't serve the triple cooked hand cut fries here like they did at the Tempe location. Instead they gave us Burger King like fries for the same price.

I do note the Onion Rings were Outstanding and only priced at around $3.50. They were delightfully crisp light and delicious. The onion also actually stayed in and didn't pull out when I ate them.

As great as the onion rings were they aren't enough for me to give this eatery more than two stars.

Maybe if you hit them when a better crew is on maybe the food is better."	4.0

I showed her the spelling on the menu and she assured me that they use real cheese and that the spelling must be a mistake. So I ordered a breakfast bagel. And it was not real cheese. It was some sort of creepy cheese like substitute. It looked like cheddar but did not taste like it."	0.0

Packaging looked clean and they had clever names for their sandwiches. I grabbed the roast beef sandwich and an orange juice, paid and ran to the gate. Then as I took a few bites, it was soggy, meat was tough (had to spit out a few bites) and the greens were completely wilted. Then I found the small date sticker on the package and they are selling sandwiches that have a date from 2 days ago for 13 bucks! Wtf?!? Why would they keep selling these? Gross	0.0

Service: The lady at the counter was pleasant and quick. Off to a good start plus roasted veg sandwich with pesto, goat cheese and romesco sauce in a wheat toast sounds soooo good! 

My food was taking a little long hmmm ok. Saw some toast sitting on the toaster and thought --- wow those looks awfully burnt. 

Got my food. Fries and the sandwich -- no bag? Ok I'll ask for it. Here you go with the guy grumbling I gotta go home. A little unprofessional don't you think? 

Fries are good but would've liked them more crispy. Opened up my sandwich only to find that burnt toast I was eyeing. I ended up deconstructing the sandwich bec the burn toast overpowered the taste. Got the goat cheese taste-- nothing special. The grilled veggies? No taste at all. Very bland! Yuck! Ended up throwing most of the sandwich away. Off to my connecting flight."	1.0
14	VaEqjAeKAm_iUnOpaktyMg	1.0	1.0	1.0	"Let's have a serious talk about airport food.  

Let me start by saying--Nocawich is NOT an example of the expected lackluster airport food that we all know and love.  Their sandwiches are oh so delicious.  The staff has always been friendly enough when I've bought stuff from there.  I love the Cashew Blackberry Jelly sandwiches (CB&J) to the point where I've decided I should probably re-think my PB&Js that I eat at home.  The ham and cheese with the spicy mustard is incredible, and one of my favorite airport sandwiches ever.

So, why one star?  The freaking price of a sandwich.  Their prices are so bad, it's infuriating on principle.  There's no way that ANYONE should be giving this restaurant good reviews due to their prices.  Where the hell are we, on the moon?  You know how you can tell when your sandwiches are overpriced?  When someone walks in with an expense account, gets a 15% airport discount, and when they look at what $19 bought them, they can't believe it.  You know that you've lost your market when business travelers with expense accounts won't buy your product on principle of cost.

The CB&J sandwich that I mentioned earlier is $6.00, which is pretty outrageous, especially for the size of the sandwich that you get.  However, it's probably one of the better values on the menu.  

And even the consistency of their pricing is way off!  Nocawich has two locations in PHX Terminal 4.  In their full service location, the cost of the previously referenced delicious ham and cheese sandwich is $9.99.  This is ABSURD.  The icing on the cake is this, though:  The exact same ham and cheese sandwich, with the same condiments, wrapped in the exact same wrapping, on the same bread, simply out of a different freezer about 150' away is $10.50.  So, you can save .51 for walking 150'.  I forget the exact cost of the CB&J at the Nocawich express location, but it's certainly not less.  Might as well walk the 150' for them to make you a fresh one!

The sandwiches are delicious, but I just can't recommend it, and this is frustrating because this would be one of my airport staples if only the pricing was realistic.  The PHX Skyharbor airport is LOADED with really good places to eat (And the so is the city!). There's literally no good reason to come here over another restaurant for these prices.  And I really wish I could!!"	1.0

I waited in line to order for 10 minutes and there was only 1 person in front of me! Two people dropped out of line because of the wait. The cook had an attitude but was able to talk or accept hugs from other workers who stopped by to talk. The food was not very good, although luckily it was edible. If you are in a rush to catch your flight I do not recommend coming here as you will either miss your boarding or you won't get your food! This place was also very pricey for a sandwich and burger.	0.0

The clerk made me feel a little foolish when she saw me looking at a different menu, offered to take my order, then proceeded to inform me I couldn't order from her.

My guy wasn't stoked on his burrito, I recall that much, though it has been a little bit since we were actually there. I do believe it was cold for the length of time we waiting. I know for sure that I was unimpressed by my cold, gelatinous glob of steel cut oatmeal. Though the pound of brown sugar it swam in was quite good, it was a little tough to enjoy the very very cold item I had received.

My husband got the roast beef sandwich, it was not fresh... At all, bland, soggy. Bleh!

I got the Simple Salad... You would think 6 ingredients would be easy to execute, however the carrots were slimy and mushy... Basically on the way to rotten. Everything else in the salad was fine but I opted to use the balsamic dressing from Humble Pie as the creamy white dressing included didn't look like the ""red wine vinaigrette"" that was supposed to be in the salad kit.

My Aguachiles (the red kind) not only smelled rancid it also tasted like it. My husband was in need of a new refreshment and it took 15 mins. For someone to pass by (not our waitress who was too busy flirting with the band members at the bar) for us to ask for a refill. Needless to say, I did not finish my Aguachiles and now I'm kind of scared of getting some sort of infection later tonight for eating some of that rancid raw shrimp. I would not be coming here again since  this goes beyond a bad waitress, if they are serving rancid raw food here I can only imagine.

The server brought us chips and salsa to the table took our drink order pretty nice gal. The other waitress came to our table to take our order and was rushing us so we got the cocktail $10.00 and asada tacos $5.50. The asada was fabulous  but the cocktail was super sour from all the lemon there was 5 shrimps in it. The only good part was the taco, live music and I took a bottle of habanero sauce to make up for the lack of shrimp.Sorry but I could not pay $30 for nothing.

I am from Los Angeles originally so my expectations for sea food are far too high, which is why i felt this place was probably the best place for ceviche. Well, I was wrong. I went yesterday 5/21/17 with my boyfriend and the waitress started off a little cold, sat us down, and took some time to take our drink orders. Then she came back around to get our orders, my boyfriend wasnt ready and she showed annoyance when he told her he needed a few more minutes. When she came to drop off our food my boyfriend and i caught her looking at something on the window but neither of us checked at what she was looking. 1 minute later my boyfriend tells me to move and i see him trying to kill a ROACH! This waitress was looking at the roach for some time and didnt bother to tell us. It couldve gotten in our food. She then comes and ""tries to kill it"" with ZERO real effort. She says ""ok i think it's gone"". Instead of offering us to be moved to another table, she just left us there. My boyfriend and i proceeded cautiously and then the ROACH WAS BACK!!!!! at this point we got so mad that we decided to get everything from the table that hadnt been touched by the roach and we moved ourselves to a table in the middle of the establishment away from the walls. Then she comes back and gives us attitude for moving. 20 minutes later the same waitress sits a new couple in our original booth without cleaning it. at this point my mind was made up i will never be back here.

My friend and I went in to enjoy some seafood, but from the beginning it was a bad experience. We walked in and one of the servers accused us of trying to skip some people that were there before us. We didn't even know who to talk to in order to get on the waiting list. 

After about 10 minutes of wait we were sat down. The table we were setted at next to the door so ever time someone walked it it hit the back of my friend's chair. So we asked to be moved and got an ugly look, but we moved to another table. 

The food is very good just like seafood should be fresh! Everything tasted fresh we had oysters, & tostadas de ceviche (shrimp tostadas.) The micheladas are very good also if your over the age of 21 of course.

He fixed the problem but then proceeded to tell me that it was my job to let him know exactly what I wanted next time so it's less confusing. Last I checked I'm pretty sure that was the servers job. Thanks for fixing it Ben but next time don't make the customer feel responsible for you mistake. Thanks.	0.0

We got immediate seating, but it took more than 30 minutes for our server to bring any food to the table.  We had to flag down another server and ask her to find the other one who had taken our order.  When our server finally reappeared, he was copping a hostile attitude, like we had no right to expect him to bring any actual food to the table.  I had a beef salad.  Underneath the spices I could taste that the beef had already started to decay.  Yuk!  There didn't seem to be any manager on premises.  Warning:  if you pay by credit card, you have to run it through the machine on your table, which automatically adds a 20% tip unless you opt out.	0.0

Unfortunately tonight's visit was far from superb as we are used to. We walked in and requested a BOOTH for 5, we told there was another group ahead of us and it would be 10- 15 minutes. When our table was finally ready for us 15 minutes later, it was not a booth. I told her specifically ,""I requested a booth not a table with chairs."" She responded with, "" I was not aware of that request."" So I told her, ""I refuse this table since I requested a booth."" She again responds, "" you didnt say anything of that sort when you walked in."" At this point my fiance chimes in with, ""Actually, he said a booth for 5 please?"" The hostess then tells us,""This table is all we have for you at this time and to wait for a booth will be another 30 minutes."" I told her, ""Fine then we will will wait."" She got an attitude and began gathering all the napkins and flat ware that she just laid out at the table along with the menus. At this point I was furious, more so because I was getting the attitude from someone who obviously had no concern for my request and then got upset when I corrected her. I was so mad that I was ready to leave and go elsewhere and when I expressed that to her. She retorted ""Fine, go somewhere else and eat I don't care!"" After hearing her say that I asked to speak to the manager, she completely ignored me and walked away. Another employee gladly got the attention of the manager for me and when I expressed my disbelief and how I felt so disrespected to him. All I was told is, ""I will talk to her about this this.""  I'm sorry but when people come into your establishment and no matter what the situation is, automatically spend $60 or more on food and drinks you should do everything in your power to make them feel at ease. We finally got our booth in a matter of minutes after talking to the manager. To put the icing on the cake, I noticed after that anyone requesting a booth after we were seated got one right away. This had me heated, then my fiance told me,"" You made a  complaint, so now she is gonna do everything to make sure she doesn't get another one tonight.""

The egg was Sunnyside up. When we asked them to cook it completely we were told they would burn it. I asked why they couldn't cook another egg....the kitchen manager said ""no one wants it that way"". After much discussion they cooked another egg.

Not knowing who it is yet a person walks by and says, ""whatcha you want to drink?"". Um...yeah hi, how are you or how about a hey I'm going to be your waiter. Anyways... just thought he was super busy which is ok. Once he's back with our drinks he takes our orders. We both order the same meal, steak and shrimp with broccoli. My girlfriend asked to substitute the broccoli with mushrooms and add grilled onions. I want to add more shrimp to my order. Our meals arrive, mine looked fine but hers had two orders of mashed potatoes,  mushrooms and onions. Looked strange at first but whatever we went with it, we were hungry. 

Here is where it gets interesting. As my girlfriend was eating her mashed potatoes she feels a chewy piece in her mouth. She takes it out and it looks like a piece of toilet paper or some kind of white paper. (We had brown paper napkins only, not a single white napkin or paper on the table.) The bad part is, this was one of her last bites and didn't think of returning the food at that point. So, to not make scene we just inform our waiter about the piece of paper and advice him to let the cooks know to be more careful. He grabs our plates, grins and doesn't say a word....ok. He then comes back and sets the check on the table and again walks away. It gets worse, we notice all of substitutes were charged as well. Did he not understand what a substitute is? We ate it so whatever, we were over it and just wanted to leave. I would rate the food a 5 star for taste minus the paper in my food but 0 stars for service. 

Hint to the waiter:

Next time attempt to act like you care. A simple, Im sorry let me see what I can do, goes a long way. I wasn't expecting a free meal but it would have been nice to least offer another side to make up for the contaminated mashed  potatoes. Also, we were really nice about he whole thing, next time you may not get people like us."	0.0

Tonight though, ughhhhhhhh-nnoying, our server, Alex was so incredibly inattentive. It took very long to have drinks ordered after being sat. Then I didn't get to start my meal for exactly 1 hour and 2 minutes (I timed it). Also, the water glasses tasted awful and due to how we were NEVER given attention to for over 40 minutes, they stayed at our table until we finally said something. To top it off refills were NEVER offered until after our food came.Even when the food came we were never asked the infamous ""how is everything, ladies.""

When we were seated at our table, it was still wet from being cleaned & the menus were sticking to the table.  We had to wait 10 minutes for our server, Marc S. to come greet us and take our drink order.  He then took a long time to bring us our drinks & when he brought our drinks, he didn't bring my beer.  We didn't get any napkins or silverware when we were seated or when we finally got our drinks.  Marc finally brought my beer & took our order.  When he brought us our food, we still didn't have any napkins or silverware.  He brought us 2 napkins & 3 forks.  He never came back to check up on us.  We finished our drinks, and we wanted refills were wanted & I wanted another beer.  We sat at our table with no drinks trying to eat our food for at least 20 mins.  That is unacceptable.  I had to ask the hostess to have Marc come back.  He finally came over and we ordered refills.  Throughout our experience there & with Marc, he wasn't personable at all & not a pleasant interaction with him.  I though Applebee's was supposed to be an upbeat fun place to go with our family & friends for a bite to eat, get some drinks & enjoy our experience.  This was my worst experience ever at this Applebee's & any other Applebee's for that matter.  Not planning on going there again anytime soon.  Very disappointing & a terrible experience.	0.0

We actually hadn't been there for about a year when we decided to give it another shot a few nights ago. We walked in about 8:30pm and it wasn't busy. Stood around for at least 5 minutes before we were seated. Once seated we waited 8 to 10 minutes for our waitress to even come over. We placed our order and when the waitress brought our food she just set it down and quickly walked away. Normally this wouldn't be a big deal except one of our meals was the total wrong thing. She was no where to be seen for several minutes. In the time we were waiting I took a bite of my steak and spit it back out. It tasted bad. It was gray looking inside and had a funny taste. So the waitress finally comes back and we tell her one of the orders was wrong and grabs a menu and procedes to debate what we ordered. She just wrote down the wrong thing. We ended up not eating. Our meal was ruined. This is the worst Applebee's ever.	0.0

Definitely a good deal and my wife and I decided to take advantage of that.  Service was a little slow, and even worse, the server was stacking orders. He took 4 tables orders and then put them in after taking all 4.  A big no no in food service industry.  It took over 40 minutes to get a couple of burgers.  After we ate quickly, we received the bill and the burgers were rung in at full price.  I flagged the waiter and let him know of the error.  The manager comes out and says that the burgers are not $7.  I said to go ask your host what he said.  He does not and wants to argue instead and says that that promotion is on a different day.  I asked again if he was going to ask his host and he said no, but he would adjust the price down.  As a manager, leader, you need to stand behind your employees, even if they make a mistake.	1.0

When we first walked in, we were greeted by a young lady who had an attitude. She looked annoyed with her job and it pushed over to us. She asked if we wanted a booth or table and we requested a booth. She took us over to the booths and wanted to seat us in the middle of 5 booths which were all full. I requested if we could move farther away from the other diners as we like a more a quieter place to enjoy our meals. It took over 10 minutes for our server , Makayla, to show up and ask for our drink orders. It took her another 10 minutes to bring back our drinks. One of us had some coffee and was told that she was going to bring us back some sugar and waited and waited until finally I had to remind her to which she admitted she completely forgot about. She then asked if we were ready for our food orders. We opted for the Oriental Salad and two house burgers. She asked if we wanted our burgers slightly pink and we both agreed. It took a little over 35 minutes to get our food over to our table. When we got our food, the burgers were splattered on the plates with no lettuce, tomato, onions etc. only cheese and a deformed burger. We requested the additional toppings and she brought them over pretty quick. The burger was disgusting. It was bland with no flavor at all. The bun was soggy and the cheese was stale and slightly melted. The only reason they're getting a one star is because it won't let me do 0 stars and because the salad was decent. As we sat there trying to eat this horrendous food, we never saw Makayla again. We saw her again when she took over our bill and quickly bolted away never asking how our food was or if we need some more drinks.

The drink I got I didn't like it at all because it was extremely sweet and I could barely taste any alcohol in it. My friends tried it and they agreed with me. When I asked a waitress walking around if I could change it she said no because the drink I have is the one with the most alcohol on the menu and if I don't like it I would have to pay for it and pay for the new one. You go central bistro, postinos, st. Francis (which are places around that area) they will exchange your drink if you don't like it for free which will make us want to give them a bigger tip, but I guess cheaper places are too cheap for that.

I sent the soup back and asked for the breadsticks that accompany and the waitress brought back the soup and no breadsticks. Long story short we had to ask 3 additional times for breadsticks and when they finally came they were greasy as hell. Besides the piss poor service the dishes were dirty. The only thing that was consistent was the waitress apologizing to the other patrons for the multiple screw ups. Never again, it makes no sense to have such horrible customer service and expect to be tipped.	2.0

STELLA made the top 2 of The Worst Server Ever list. 

It took about 30 minutes to get an order of cheese sticks. I'd ordered it with Ranch dressing and the server forgot to bring it so about 10 minutes later I tracked her down at the booth behind us and asked for the Ranch dressing, about 10 minutes after asking she stopped by with some weird paper cup with dressing in it. It didn't matter at that point, the cheese sticks were cold. 
After an extremely long wait dinner was served but then I realized we didn't have napkins. I couldn't find anyone to help so I ended up going to the bar and grabbing a stack of drink napkins. My husbands order was incorrect but we once again couldn't locate our server and at this point we had already been here for an hour so he ate his bacon cheeseburger with some kind of sauce he specifically said he did not want. At this point the only decent thing to happen was a Pepsi but I could never get a refill until 10 minutes before we left. Oh yeah, my husband's fries didn't get served when he received his cheeseburger, they came out some time later. When we were able to interact with Stella it was with one word answers/comments from her...yes, sorry, odd looks etc. My son summed it up nicely by saying you can't expect much from a restaurant that's equivalent to a Walmart. I don't shop at Walmart and I'll never eat at Applebee's again.

Secondly when we were seated and the server came, she gave no friendly intro nothing, straight to the ""what can I get for you.?""...(uhmmm who are you?) I asked for a margarita for olives on the side. I got the margarita 15 minutes later no olives. And she wouldn't come often, so I let it go, unhappy, but let it go. The people who I came with asked for the quencher iced tea which looks GREAT in the menu with fresh fruit and all, what we got was a plain cup, no fruit. So why pay more for this than a regular tea? Anyway. Ordered my steak with steamed broccoli and pasta. The steak looked like it had been sitting out for an hour. The broccoli was SUPER DRY and the cheese on the pasta was already hardening. I mean..really?? This was the most unappetizing, unappealing dish I have ever ordered! So anyway I order a second margarita with olives on the side AGAIN. This time I get them but one of them looks like it's rotting away. When we asked for the check and boxes it took nearly 15-20 minutes for the check and she had to ask how many boxes THREE times before the manager David came and took care of that. Which was greatly appreciated but the manager shouldn't have to worry about something so simple like getting a customer boxes.  I'm sure he has bigger things to worry about like, great food and service. Which in my case, was a fail this time around. Hopefully if ever do decide to come back, things are different.

First off, the Rosati's chain has been broken down... they're not all alike. This particular restaurants crust is a little soggier (but it's not soggy, it's just not what I grew up with or ate regularly when we lived in Scottsdale.) Also, the sauce is blander.  

This restaurant seems to have a problem with time management.  My husband tells me that he usually has to wait a few minutes past the time they say to be there for the pizza to be ready.  He said it happens more often than not.

We started having really bad customer service a couple weeks ago, though.  

Last week I called in an order, but their internet was down.  It was a bit of a chore for the guy to get the order in because I am in a Rosati's club/program where I get points for dollars spent and they had given me a special Halloween coupon...  I spent $30 and never did get credit for that as it turns out.  Given the night, I am not surprised.  So I'd called in my order and they said to be there between 30-35 minutes.  We got there at 35 minutes from hanging up my phone.  Guy at the front took my money and then went into the back.  .....................................................  He didn't come back!  Right about the time we were wondering, ""what the heck?"" we hear the bald headed  bearded man kind of berating someone in the back.  They had not made our pizza, the guy didn't see the ticket or something.  And we waited.  Waited.  Nobody even came out to tell us they screwed up!  We waited for at least 20 minutes before they brought out the pizza.  He just handed it to me and said to have a good night.  My comment to him was that an apology would have been appropriate.  He looked at me like I was crazy.  He did not seem to understand that making a customer wait for their screw-up was not good business.

Onto last night... I didn't want to give them our business again, but we had a GROUPON we'd already paid for.  I called and placed the order.  They said 25 minutes.  My husband got there at 30 minutes because he didn't want to wait.  His plan backfired.  He had to wait.  He said something to the bald headed bearded guy and apparently my husband got the ""you're crazy"" look that I'd seen the week before.  Husband takes pizza home.  We open box.  HORROR!  Ok, maybe that a bit extreme, but it was gross.  There was a big black pile of burnt crap on the pizza (plus a smaller one just to fuck up more of the pie, I think.)  (I'll post pictures here of the pizza.)  I think it was burned cornmeal, but it was clearly burned onto the pizza.  This means someone took this out of the oven, looked at it, and thought it was good enough to give to a paying customer.  I'm not talking about a little bubble of burned cheese (which, imo, is delicious.)  This was truly unappetizing.  We were starving so each grabbed a piece from the unaffected area and off husband went back to Rosati's.  The bald headed bearded man offered to make a new pizza, but he never apologized.  My husband was offended at the offer because he'd have to wait another half an hour.  When he asked to talk to the manager, the bald headed bearded man said HE was the manager (doubtful, not many business owners will treat a customer who comes to their establishment most every week this way.)   I guess this is the point my husband lost his cool and swore at the guy and  advised other waiting customers to not solicit this business.  

Real shame.  I grew up in the Chicago area.  My first job was at Rosati's.  I've been eating there for 42 years.  Rosati's of Mesa won't get my familys business anymore. When I have a real hankering, I know the one on Shea in Scottsdale is top notch."	10.0

First of all when I called to order their customer service was horrible. The girl I spoke with acted annoyed when I asked her anything, including what my total was. Then the pizza arrived cold, and late. The hot wings we ordered were disappointing. Instead of coating them in the hot sauce they literally just poured the sauce on the top wings and called it a day. They were too lazy to toss the wings so that they all have sauce on them. All of the bottom wings didn't have sauce and the top ones were overly coated in it.

When we finally picked up the food, I have to say it was disappointing.  As for the pizza, the sauce was good and toppings were OK, but the crust was burnt. The fried zucchini was tasteless and mushy, plus they forgot the side of ranch that we ordered. Based on other reviews, it appears that Rosati's has some quality control issues with some of their locations. Other locations may be good, but I definitely would not recommend this one.	0.0

Me and the Hubby went a few weeks ago and I wished that the review would show up on the check in date instead of the write up date but...
We went for breakfast, were promptly seated, then waited, and waited, and then our waitress (I usually call them servers seeing how I was one for many years, but not in this case) finally gets to us and takes our drink order and sighs because I wasn't quite ready to order.
When we did order, my hubby was asking me what he should get out of 2 things and all she heard was him saying something, heard it was a menu choice and decided he was getting that for breakfast.  Meals came out timely, they weren't the greatest things ever, but it was IHOP, and didn't expect them to be; however, they were pretty good, he had gotten some moons over my hammy type thing they have at Denny's and I got the double BLT and was happy that they didn't make my bacon crispy.  Finally got a drink refill and with it came the question if I needed a box...not if I was going to  need one, as I am still eating the last half of my sandwich and fries are gone, but the question wasn't brought up to the person that still had half a sandwich left and was no longer touching it.
The bill came early almost the same time the food was dropped off and I guess that is protocol for them and by the service I guess she felt that since she dropped off the ticket that we no longer required service.  Talked to the guy in charge at the time and he made excuses and so I told him that we wouldn't be returning to any IHOP for a while and never again to this location"	1.0

I sat there for about 45 minuets before I went to ask my waitress when my food was going to be ready. With a blank stare on her face she said, ""It should of been out already."" Then she looked at her tickets. Turns out she forgot all about my food. I left, because not only did she ignore me, but no apology was issued. I decided to give this restaurant one last chance. My waiter was unprofessional and inattentive. There where only two other tables for him to tend to and I rarely saw him at any of them. Almost an hour passes, so I ask about my food and he tells me it is coming right out. another 30 minutes go by, I ask again, same response. I then hear a plate break in the kitchen. He then comes out and tells me its going to take a little longer because there was an accident in the kitchen. I should of left right there and then, but I decided to stay due to good company.

I asked for extra ranch on both orders.  Each order already comes with one ranch so that means I should get a total of at least four ranches (more if they're nice).  When I paid for my food at the restaurant I politely said, ""hey, can you make sure that there's extra ranch in there for me?""  The girl looked at me like she was annoyed by my question and said ""yeah.""  When she brought out my food she handed me the bag, I said thank you, and she walked back into the kitchen without saying a word.  I looked in the bag and there were only 3 ranches in there, which was no big deal, so I asked the hostess if ""it would be possible for me to get a couple more ranches.""  She said ""yeah sure"" and went in the kitchen, then came back out and said ""umm it's gonna be an extra 60 cents per ranch.""  I said ""ok, but I did order extra ranch on the phone and I only got 3 in here.""  She told me that if I order extra ranch I should only get ""like 3 or 4.""  I didn't feel like arguing so I gave her the $1.20 for another two ranches.  I'm a little agitated that I was treated like some kind of a**hole when I don't think I could have been more polite.  I don't really care that I had to pay extra for the ranch.  I was more concerned about the way these girls were talking to me.

They looked quite busy when I arrived, so I headed straight to the surprisingly small bar, being a single diner. I waited quite a while to get noticed standing, but will not put timelines here because I didn't realize then it was going to be an issue. I finally caught the attention of a server refilling a water behind the bar, and she brought me to the bartender's attention. He informed me that no one was leaving soon, so I headed back to the host stand. They were accommodating there, informed me there was just one party ahead of me unless I wouldn't mind a tiny table. That was perfect for me but I didn't realize it was an INVISIBLE table. Again I waited for some time but still felt quite forgiving. When Alison arrived she was pleasant enough; asked for a drink order, and instead I put in my entire order, later wishing I had asked for my side salad first. Is this an option servers give diners? And I understand the volume you are doing but I so prefer to give a temperature on my burger. Everything came at once and brought by a different server. She dropped my food and started to leave; very loud in there and I felt badly I had to raise my voice for 'Hey can I get some silverware?'. She looked under that ridiculous amount of napkins that had been left (managers, product cost?) as if I had not seen my roll up. As she went to retrieve one, I realized I had no pepper or mustard. When she dropped my roll up off- I had to get up and follow her to ask for the condiments, which then seemed difficult to find. Finally started on my salad while my burger got cold. Alison DID do a check-back which was impressive, but before I even GOT to my burger she came back and offered dessert? My water was never refilled; I got Alison's attention and gave her my card, and my receipt came with no itemized receipt. No one said goodnight to me on the way out. I would blame this poor service on being so busy, but the entire time I was there I saw plenty of servers milling around.	0.0

While waiting 45 minutes to be seated, I fainted from standing up and waiting so long. When I fainted, I was lucky to have 2 friends near to help because the hostesses could not have cared less. My friends told them I needed water and all they did was walk me over water about 2 minutes later. 2 minutes? I could be in ill condition. Needless to say NOBODY asked me if I needed medical attention or an ambulance. I fainted clear as day right in front of their hostess stand and nobody cared. If the health of your own customers on your restaurant floor is not enough for your staff to care than you need to fire your hostesses and gain employees who care about human decency. I have never fainted before so I don't know what the protocol is. But I do know one thing for sure, the health and decency of all humans (workers or non workers) entering your business should always be a first priority. Please, retrain your staff on what to do if a person is in need of medical attention. Luckily, water was enough to get me back going, but you should ALWAYS ask if they need medical attention. PS after waiting I did get my BOGO which was awful quality wings and our server, Allison, was more concerned with closing out her shift than helping us have quality service.

She took about 10 min to greet us. Then our waters took about another 10 min. We ordered lunch right away because we were in a hurry and I specified 3 times to her that I wanted my quesadilla plain to which she replied ""I got it, no problem"". Well about 25 maybe 30 minutes go by and we finally get our food. Yes you guessed it! Pico de gallo was all over and inside my quesadilla. I am allergic to tomatoes so of course I asked for a new one. She then blamed it on the cooks which I know wasn't true because she simply had too many parties and probably just forgot. She then brings me out my new quesadilla and it's delicious but that also took another 15-20 min. At this point my friend is done with her meal and needs to leave. So I scarfed my food and we got ready to pay. We split the bill of course and my friend paid cash. I paid with a card and everything was dandy. Until I got home and checked my bank account. My lovely server charged my card for both of our meals and didn't even mention to me that she did that. This missing money from my account was a complete surprise later when I was going through my bank account. 
1st off can someone please explain to me why I even paid for my meal that took 45 min to get?

I can NOT take the snippy attitude your waitresses and your hostesses have, seriously do something!

I mean what's your deal???

Asked for a refill on the water, I got a glass with no ice just warm water and slammed it on the table, I COULD NOT believe it :(

Never felt like a burden before especially when I was spending my money, at this bww they make feel that.

I can also tell there is a click of waitresses hating their life and arguing by the computer/flat screen where they place the orders, they were pointing on tables and arguing, not a pleasant professional way, you made me feel very uncomfortable when you pointed at me!

You know, I was just there to eat late night with a business partner that was it, we were not there to do anything else, you left a bitter taste in our mouth.

Not a minute after our food arrived a roach crawled across our table through my food from the wall. I screamed with a serious phobia of bugs and jumped up and say on another table. I got the waitress who got the manager right away. The manager came to talk with us and just as she did the roach came back and ""BAM"" she stepped on it and motioned the waitress back over. She asked if I wanted new food because the roach had gone on my food but my appetite had gone and I was very pale and felt like I was going to pass out or throw up. She didn't offer a voucher for next time or a gift card. She comped our meals but it didn't mean much because I didn't really get to eat at all.

Needless to say, after 15 minutes of being seated I had to go in and ask the bartender for a server. 5 minutes later, our server arrived. He took our drink order and brought that back 5 minutes later. He left and said he would be right back for our order. Another 15 minutes goes by, still no server. I had to go in and ask for him AGAIN. He was sent back to our table and took our order. We only ordered three things. Our food was brought to the table by another person and was wrong. Go figure. By this time my already lukewarm Pepsi with the generously given 3 ice cubes has gone to hot..... the server returns and we ask for our bill and boxes, we have had enough by this point. 10 minutes later we get a few boxes, after we asked for them AGAIN by another server passing through our area. Our server brought the check and I gave him my card to pay for the bill after it was corrected for his mistake. Another 10 minutes..... he brings the corrected bill and FORGETS HE HAS TAKEN MY CREDIT CARD ENTIRELY. He then states he needs to go inside and find my card. He comes back, corrected bill and my card. I sign. We leave. AWFUL FROM START TO FINISH. NO MANAGER EVER CAME.

Took us forever and pissing off the waitress to figure out our order.  The snack size of the boneless wings has 8 wings and you can choose 2 sauces, the snack size of the bone-in wings has six wings and one sauce. They act like you should just know how it works.  Also,  traditional wings are more restrictive and more expensive than boneless, which in my experience is backwards.  It is also insanely loud in the place.  On top of it they charge almost $5 for the weakest, wilted little side salad.  Also, they bring 10 wings in a small order, plus carrots and celery, with an Itty bitty 2 oz. Of ranch.  Then they want $0.60 for each 2 oz. Thereafter.  They can keep it!  $38 for two for wings and mediocre fries.  $45 after tip.  Ugh...	2.0

We came in a girl, her name was Callie, gave my boyfriend and I our drinks, about five minutes later I received a phone call and told him to order for me while I took my call outside, I return almost 20 minutes later he says that neither the girl that gave us our drinks or the guy, Nate, had looked his way since I left. About five minutes after that Callie finally takes our order, she gets my order wrong, because she did not write it down, it happens, I ate it, didn't complain, and we sat there for another 20 minutes as Nate, walked to and from his POS system and ignoring every customer at the bar unless they yelled and waved for him, he even made eye contact with us in the mirror behind the POS and still ignored me, it's seemed as though Callie was now at the well and Nate was suppose to be in charge of customers at the bar. Get it together. Either get some better bartenders that can actually handle the well themselves instead of a all hands on deck mentality.

To be honest, it's only worth it to eat here on Tuesdays or Thursdays because it's *slightly* cheaper. Everything is overpriced from the wings to the burgers. They even charge for celery, carrots and ranch which is actually ridiculous. This wouldn't be a problem if the portions and quality/taste were satisfactory. You have to be very specific with your order (whether you order takeout or dine-in) because they often get details wrong. If you order takeout make sure you open everything up and check if it's all correct. To be fair, all wing places are usually overpriced.	0.0

I have spent quite a bit of time (and money) at this particular bdubs, if you will. Lately, my experiences haven't been the best and I feel that it needs to be put onto paper. 

Fairly recently, I have noticed that the employees seem to be of a much lower morale. They don't seem to be the typical upbeat bartenders and servers that they usually are. One visit in particular showed me why this is, it's the management. I saw a manager openly yell at an employee and embarrass them in front of customers. This is so wrong and unprofessional on so many levels. These waiters / waitresses and bartenders are the SOLE reason I continue to come here. I can get a blue moon and some crappy wings anywhere... But the people are what make this place such a great environment! To see the managerial staff treat these folks this way, is unacceptable. 

I will continue to come here but I will not support the managers of this establishment. It's unprofessional and deeply bothers me that they treat such wonderful, upbeat and energetic employees the way they do.

The bill was the most confusing bill I have ever seen. They started to split it up by seat but stopped at the 3rd person and threw everything else on the bottom. I told the waitress to change the billing to what a normal receipt looks like and she did. They also did not charge us the correct happy hour prices. The bill also had the food on it that was 10 minutes late. The manager did take care of it removing that item and was very nice.

I knew it would be busy so I showed up early and patiently waited for a high top in the bar since I was alone. After I got a table my waiter was right there but it took awhile to get my beer, at least he took my wing order. When he delivered my beer and wings he didn't come back till my glass was empty. It took 15 minutes to get my new beer. According to my waiter it was because the tap had bown, but I saw the bartender pouring the same beer. 

As I am getting ready for the game I notice that the two big screens in the bar are on different games. Mind you I didn't expect both but 1 was on a lower seed game and the other was on a game that didn't star for 20 min. I asked for the channel to be changed and was told they don't change channels. I was shocked that a #1 team was going to only be on small TVs and started looking for my waiter to cash out, but he was nowhere to be found. Thankfully a nice waitress got me my tab but I had to go give it to my waiter. He took his own sweet time even though I was trying to leave to miss as little as the game as possible. He was a bad waiter and whoever the young girl in the white worker shirt was that said she wouldn't change the channel is an idiot.

They get two stars for 2 reasons: the waitress that helped me get out of there faster and the manager who valiantly tried to keep me there. By that time I was shocked, pissed and I had tabbed out but at least he tried.

Yeah. You won't find that here. I have been here 3 times since moving to Arizona, and each time it has gotten worse(somehow).
The first time I went here, there were people soliciting services at our table to make donations to something not even worth mentioning. Twice we had our dinner interrupted by impatient rude kids asking for money. When we declined the first time, they came back. How can we enjoy our dinner when people are harassing us asking for handouts? 
The second time our waitress was nowhere to be found. Forget refills, forget napkins. But that wasn't even the most shocking thing. Our waitress forgot to give us straws for our drinks...not a big deal at all. So I asked a waitress who was walking by if she could please give us a couple of straws(which I could see hanging out of her server apron), and she made a face and said ""you'll have to ask your server for that."" FOR STRAWS? REALLY? 
The third time? This was absolutely insane. It was Friday night 03/10/17, my girlfriend and I came in well OVER an hour before closing and it seemed they were already closing up shop. That's fine I get it, get to cleaning duties early on so you can have an easy close. But the experience was if they were closing in 5 minutes.
Our server, didn't say his name, came up to the table and literally said ""hey whats up, what do you guys want"" in a dismissive tone. I looked at my girlfriend, then back at him and ordered drinks and he didn't ask if we were ready to order he was about to run off. Told him we were ready and he didn't say ""okay"" or anything he just pulled his pad out to write and looked at me. 
We ordered extra crispy wings, and some fries, not a big deal. 
Get this, he leaves and comes back in less than 3 minutes. 
The chicken was soggy, some pieces were cold, some were warm.
The fries were ACTUALLY cold like they had been sitting out all night. So when I reached for them before he walked off I said ""excuse me these fries are cold..."" 
He grabs them and says ""oh Sh*t, sorry about that"". He comes back in another 2 minutes with the SAME basket of fries heated up??? How about some fresh fries? Not old fries that have been reheated several times? Let's not forget we didn't have napkins, plates, utensils(I grabbed these from the table behind me, and used one napkin all night).

The hostess' were standing right at the booth and didn't say a word to us and the one of the girls just walked away. Anyways, we get seated and I ordered boneless wings and the server asked if I wanted celery or carrots and I said celery (cause it comes with those right?) and I also asked for extra ranch because they normally only bring 1. So we wait for about 30 minutes for our food and when it finally comes, we  eat and everything's great and then we get the check and our celery and every side of ranch(4 total) was .60 cents each?! our server was totally great don't get me wrong, but that's a really cheap execution on BWW's pricing.

This last time I eas thr only one at the bar it was 4 hours before close and still the bsrtender paid no attention to me . he tried to hurry my drink choice when I was asking about what beers they had on tap. Then once i got my beer he disapeered into the kitchen and didnt come back to take my food order for 20 minutes . then took my order snd disapeered again. My food came out quick but it was supposed to be 6 bone out and 6 bone in wings except I was missing two bone in wings.  And the bartender never came to check on me if it was okay . so I never got the problem with the wings corrected.  so I just ate my wings and left. Also 17 dollars for a combo of only 12 wings and some chips is a horrible deal. Do not get the combo they try to upsell. Total rip off. And horrible service.

The disappointment began with our disinterested host who unfortunately ended up as our server. Not only did he did not propose any lunch specials or wing specials to us at the beginning of our experience, but he never mentioned his name or welcomed us in. He impatiently took our order and snatched away the specials menu while my boyfriend was still looking at it. We typically eat at B Dubs for the specials so this was a tad frustrating. Our food was brought to us by a kind food runner, but our server did not return to the table for check ins. Finally, he dropped the check without stopping at the table or saying a word. After about 20 minutes of us waiting for him to return for the check, I said ""excuse me"" as he walked by. He ignored me and continued walking, but thank goodness for another server who overheard me and tended to our closing needs. Our server failed to complete our payment with a gift card until a manager stepped in. I saw our server roll his eyes towards me and our table two or more times during our 70 minute, ""lunch rush"" experience. Disappointed and frustrated is an understatement.

The staff additionally had no way for us to move Hiro to the other side, recommending that we jump over the fence and jump back over.

I'd like to preface this by saying this is not a service review. The service was not the problem, although if she would have told me the Blue Moon was almost 7 dollars, I would have bought a six-pack of it on my way home instead. $5 would have been reasonable.

The real problem what what I ate. We ordered the soft pretzels and cheese as an appetizer - they were fine. As a Canadian, when I saw they added a special - Poutine - I had a nostalgia moment and ordered it. It was a long way from the delicious, savory poutine from my homeland. For those of you who have never eaten poutine, it would fit right in with southern style cooking. Take french fries, add creamy cheese curds (or if you're not sure where to buy those, chopped up braided mozzarella works well too), top with fresh, steamy brown gravy. The gravy and heat from the fries melts the cheese into a melty mountain of yum.

This was not what I experienced. First of all, the cheese curds were breaded and deep fried (another special appetizer they had). Instead of the poutine effect of creamy, melty, cheesy goodness, it was more like soggy clumps. I made due, it's been a while since I've had poutine. I asked for no pico de gailo, because I had no idea why it was included in their poutine. I didn't get any as part of the order, so once again, i praise the server for taking a proper order. There was enough gravy, but there was just something...off about it. It was very subtle, but there was a peculiar sourness to it that was enough for me to catch on my palette, but not enough for me to expect anything was wrong other than an odd recipe for one of my all-time favorite meals. 

The abdominal pain started at 2 am, about 4 hours after consuming the meal. I'm a tall guy so things take their time digesting...usually. I was not prepared for the razor like purge that followed. Without sharing too many details of the horror stories that went on in that room, I will say that finally, at 12 pm today, I stopped feeling sick.

Now I don't know if it was the cheese curds or the gravy (leaning towards the gravy), but I feel like there were some definite corners cut in the kitchen. If you're going to be serving food to people, what's coming out of the kitchen is a reflection on both the chef staff and the management. You need to have standards. Taste your food. Keep it consistent. 

This is the only location that I've ever had such an experience. I hope this criticism serves as constructive, to prevent others from getting sick from the food. Please be conscious of the freshness of ingredients!"	1.0

The water in my glass was nasty metallic tasting. My steak was easily the worst meat I've ever been served in my life. It was an odd looking long banana-shaped thing that did not taste like beef at all. Maybe it was goat or horse but IT WAS NOT BEEF.

It sort of tasted like the jerked goat burgers I had in Jamaica. I've been eating beef my entire life, this tasted nothing like, looked nothing like, and had the consistency nothing like any beef I've ever had, in my life.

Don't think I'll be going back there. Ever.

I did not want to complain at the store because there is no coming back from being served a piece of meat like this, it should have never been served to a human customer. Complaining only jeopardizes your safety in any restaurant. Never send food back to the kitchen for replacement is my philosophy. We simply cut short our visit and got the hell out without saying a word. I'll express my displeasure by never returning."	1.0

The mozzarella sticks were bland and the sauce was a really weird flavor. The spinach and artichoke dip was ATROCIOUS, had no texture, and tasted like broccoli. I ordered the fiesta lime chicken, and it was a reheated nightmare. The sauce on the chicken was too salty, and the melted cheese had hardened on top of the chicken. The only thing that made it lime chicken was the tiny slice of lime on the side. I also could have done without the huge nest of soggy chips underneath the chicken, which was the majority of the dish.  The Spanish rice was also dry, looked old, and was pretty bland. 
Overall, it was a disappointment, and it's a good thing we had a giftcard, otherwise I would not have wanted to pay for this."	1.0

There was maybe another 10 people in the entire restaurant. We waited to be seated for about a good 7 minutes and absolutely no one greeted us. Then after we sat ourselves, we sat at our table talking for a good 10-15 minutes before anyone approached us at our table (we have no been in the restaurant about 20ish minutes with no one attempting to welcome or assist us) - reminding you that it was not busy in the slightest. Eventually, it got to the point where we pushed the ""Call Server"" button on the little table kiosk and she still didn't come for another 5 minutes. I look over toward the rear of the restaurant and all the waitresses, other than the bartender, were sitting down in a booth talking and not responding to their tables. Finally, we are helped, but the service continues to be just as poor. The waitress brought us our drinks and our food slowly and after that she visited our table once, and it still was not busy so we should've been a piece of cake for her to handle. My boyfriend and I both work in jobs that require exceptional customer service and know how terrible it is to get a bad review on your store location and typically we wouldn't post one, but I never had worse service than I have with this experience. Every other Applebee's I've been to has always done really amazing! So I'm sad to say that this location wasn't up to par standards. Definitely won't be going back to this location."	0.0

No sense of humor. Just cold miserable stares. 
For an appetizer we ordered 2 orders of Mozzarella Sticks that came too cold on the inside. It was like eating a string cheese fresh out of the fridge. 
It took 46 minutes for our main course to arrive. 46 minutes to make 3 steaks, 1 sandwich, a bowl of French Onion soup, and a burger. My rare steak came well done.

We came during happy hour so our drinks were pretty cheap, my friend actually got wasted from all the discounted alcohol. I just got plain chicken tenders and fries, they were good but the honey mustard sauce was too sweet. My friend ordered a steak (medium rare) baked potatoes with a side of broccoli. He said his potato and the broccoli were delicious but his steak was far from medium rare and it had a chewy, plastic consistency. I really don't expect much from Applebee's but I don't appreciate paying 17 dollars for a small steak and having it taste like complete crap.	2.0

We come to this Applebee's several times a month, whether it be for late night happy hour or for Kid's Eat Free on Tuesdays. Mostly on Kids eat free Tuesdays. I'm a single mom and on a budget, so we go a couple of Tuesdays a month and I will get a half price appetizer and a drink and my son will eat for free a $3.99 kids meal. It's a great deal when both of us eat for $10 including tip. Not tonight, though. Although I've never had an issue before, my bill came back and I made the server aware that my son's meal was not taken off. He said he'd speak with his Manager. The manager, Jamie, came over and was confrontational from the start. She stated that this is a business and that I can't have my son's meal for free because that just doesn't make sense because his meal is the same price as mine. She said that it was free with an Entree and that the sign out side said so and that I could go check. I let her know that I wasn't aware that the policy had changed since the last time we'd been and that I had to order an entree (which I've never had to do in the past). 

She continued to say that I'm lying that I've been before on Tuesdays because she does inventory and she's here every Tuesday. She continued on in front of other patrons stating that this is a business that needs to make money. I paid, left embarrassed and will probably never return to this Applebee's again, if any. Our server was a doll, the food was just ok as usual, but the nightmare of this manager was enough to say no thank you to ever returning. 

As I was leaving, I checked the sign outside, and of course there is no mention of ""free with purchase of Entree"" anywhere on the building. Sooo I took a picture to post of that sign too."	0.0

(When I placed my order online I was given a time it would be ready ) I waited a good 10minutes before I was acknowledged. I received my order in another 15minutes. I get home and I find out that they messed up my order. Mind you it's 115 degrees outside and I live about 15-20min away. I call the store to speak with a manager. She offered to remake my meal and I would travel to go pick it up or she could report it to Corporate and they would send me something. It was hot out and I was tired. I opted for Corporate to send me something. I received two $5 coupons. The audacity...the insult!! I am sure I spent close to $40 on my order. The $5 coupon is a slap in the face!

This is the THIRD time this has happened there. I don't understand why this is so difficult to get right!? Our waitress gave a pathetic , ""Eh, sorry"" and walked away. You could at least ACT like you cared a smidgen. No drink refills either, which irked me.

Lunch is somewhat better. At least the service is, anyway. I do love their all you can eat salad and soup at lunch. 

I am also not sure why, but the ice tea at this Applebee's and at the IHOP across the street taste funny. Maybe the water? Apparently other people have commented on it as well, because the wait staff have agreed some people notice that taste.

Happy hour is awesome typically at any Applebee's, but the amount of time it took for us to get everything we ordered was disappointing. When we were first seated it took our waitress about 10 minutes to even acknowledge that we were new customers waiting to give our order. Once we ordered our drinks it took another 10 minutes to have them delivered (2 beers isn't a mix drink that a bartender has to create, right out of the tap, should have taken 5 minutes tops). When our waitress finally delivered our drinks, she ran to the table dropped the bees off and darted away, at this time we were ready to order our food and she didn't even ask us if we were ready. After flagging her down we were finally able to order our food. After about 35 minutes we flagged her down again for she had walked past our table several times and didn't give us an update about what was taking so long, nor ask us if we wanted another round of drinks. Once our food finally came out, things didnt get any better. The buffalo wings were tasty, but my steak was dry and tough. The mashed potatoes and broccoli that came along with my steak wasn't awful tasting, but also nothing special. My friend ordered a burger and said the same thing. It's just a burger nothing awesome about it but nothing nasty about it.

Im sure the kitchen gets backed up during happy hour, but that is when the waiters and waitresses should be on their toes checking on their tables to put the wait for food at ease. At this time the cooks need to make sure they still care about food quality and not worry so much about just getting the food out the door.

This was the worst Thanksgiving Dinner/meal I've ever had.  We took my mother last year to this same location, it was $14.99, wonderful, tasty meal.  This year it was $11.99 (which I didn't find out until we walked in) this should have been a tipoff.  The turkey was chopped up, re-heated and dried out, the stuffing (at least I think that's what it was) was 2 small ice-cream scoops of glop, the mashed potatoes were okay, the green beans were okay (a bit garlicky), and instead of cranberry sauce (get this) there were about 7 chopped/dried cranberries sprinkled throughout the plate.  The gravy consisted of a few drips and drabs here and there.  I cannot believe the chef here would take the time to serve this crap for a Thanksgiving meal. A better meal would be served to the homeless...no kidding. 
Well, I could go on how the servers looked like they were ready for a football game (wearing their jerseys) instead of last year how they were nicely dressed and FRIENDLY greeting at the front door.  If you're not going to serious about serving a special meal, don't bother at all.
BTW, I would have paid even more than $14.99 for something quality, befitting what one would expect for Thanksgiving.

I ordered through Doordash and one of my orders was a lunch special. Now, I go to another place which has lunch specials until 3p so I didn't think anything of it when I placed my order. The restaurant waited until my order was to be picked up to tell them that lunch specials end at 2p. So my driver had to call me to let me know when my order should have already been completed, that I can't get the lunch special.  There's nothing stopping you from ordering a lunch special after 2p on the app and there's nothing noting the time the special expires. I would think, since it was the restaurants error that it would be simple enough to just give me the order as a lunch special, and get the wrong info. fixed asap.

I was so happy when unnoticed they had Szechuan style foods here so I thought let's try them out. We spent almost $80 bucks so we can try a bunch of things but once I realized what we got the dishes were already over priced. We are not the type to look at Costco when we order so this way we can get what we like but hen looking at cost for each dish it was higher than most of the other places we go and the flavor was no there. 

The Fuqi feipian (husband and wife) cold dish was not flavorful at all. It only had thick, hard beef pieces with no tendon or tripe to be seen. And it was like 11 bucks which should normally go for about 6-7 from all the other places I've been. 

Potato dish was wayyyyy to salty and was too spicy, not like good spicy like all i tasted was like chili oil which is weird since I have never seen this dish be so red and oily. Potato's were soggy and sliced super small. 

The steam/cold chicken had no flavor and some weird sauce and it was over cooked and very tough. 

Lotus root was ok, it had a little flavor which is normal for this dish but was still on the bland side. 

Cumin lamb was terrible, they used like the thin hot pot style lamb so it was over cooked and tough and there was barely any in there. There was more onions than anything else. 

The only thing that was decent was the chicken feet which I don't eat but my GF and her sister said it was fine.

The other person in my party had to return their meal of pad tai because it was so salty you could not eat it.  They remade the dish it was still salty and no flavor.  I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone but if you do go make sure you check your food for foreign objects.	0.0

The plates are smaller, the portions are smaller, nothing is spicy anymore. It's all sweet. Even the pei wei spicy is a sweet dish. And the chicken used to be substantial chunks of chicken. Now it's mostly just fried batter covered on a sweet sauce. Hardly any chicken at all.	0.0

That time I ordered Togo. When I craved for the same thing I ordered previously which was a Poke Bowl with Quinoa, I was not happy coming home with my Togo order. It was about an hour and a half till close. I get it. Employees tired and it being a Saturday night. 

When I got home I opened my container which had no Quinoa and completely looked nothing like what I ordered previously at a different location. My container looked like it could have been a half order. There was barley any greens. Slightly more chili sauce than anything. Overall was not happy with how my food looked slapped together.

Everything is relative and comparable right? Well I've eaten at great authentic Asian restaurants in the valley and it just seems absolutely obvious to me that Pei Wei tastes like straight dog shit... My girlfriend and I feel shitty and lethargic right now. Why? Cuz we just ate a bunch of shitty Pei Wei food. What did we order? Who fuckin cares. Pei Wei sucks ass. Spend a couple extra bucks and go to an authentic family owned Asian restaurant and I guarantee that it will be better. Not some corporate food chain bullshit.	1.0

Online order said the food would be ready by 6:40pm, I got there at 6:50pm and the girl who helped me at the take out counter rung me up and said my order would be ready soon. She didn't even check the done orders on the table behind her, after she helped me she went to the back computer to help bag up orders. After 10 minutes I asked the other girl at the counter on the status of my order and giving her my name she found my order on the table and handed me the order. So in the end the 1st girl didn't even look for my finished order which was done on time, the restaurant wasn't  even that busy compared to other times I've been there. The take out section looked disorganized and overwhelmed, I'll be driving to the Pei Wei on 67th Ave for any future orders now.	0.0

I can tolerate mediocre American-Chinese food for a week night dinner, but I won't put up with horse sh*t customer service from this establishment.  As mentioned coming from a Asian background, I think this place is average at best, but my fiancee really likes it, but this will be the last time we put up with this place.  We mostly get our meals to go, considering when you walk in this place, there is a strong smell of sewage.  Tonight we ordered 3 different dishes, Mongolian Beef, Kung Pao Chicken and Honey Seared Chicken.  The food we brought back was extremely salty and the beef in the dish has a old and had a rotten smell to it.  It was very pungent and virtually inedible.  The honey seared chicken had the batter fall off and the chicken was very mushy.  The Kung Pao Chicken was the only dish tolerable.  The meal was a disgrace and left me extremely p*ssed off.  To top that off, I had to deal with some snotty brat kid at the counter.  I requested some red chile paste to go, but she refused and said they are no longer allowed to give it to customers that are ordering to go?  I said are you serious?  I asked, well you can charge it to my card and I'll pay for it.  They offered some red chile paste in the packets, but they taste like crap.  After thinking about it, I said forget it, this is freaking stupid that I would have to pay for that.  It's a matter off principle.  So, tonight is the last straw.  I refuse to pay for this crap every again.  I don't give many one star reviews but the combination of p*ss poor customer service and border line rotten meat, this place earned it!

I ordered the Caramel dish with steamed chicken, rice noodles and an extra side of sauce. When I arrived at Pei Wei it was just before the lunch rush. My order was checked by ""Kaleigh"" who was not very friendly. She had a very bad attitude. From the call to the face to face interaction I felt like placing my order was a big inconvenience. I paid for my order and left thinking what awful people they have working there. When I got home i took one bite of my order and realized it was not rice noodles. I have an allergy to the regular noodles which is why I modified my order. My stomach was in immediate pain as to how sensitive my allergy is. I drove back to Pei Wei and the same girl was at the counter. I told her that my order was wrong and I could not eat it. She asked rudely if I wanted a side of rice noodles. I declined and told her I would like my order remade as the chicken was cross contaminated. She did not alert the manager, I assume for how busy it was. I cannot emphasis enough how TERRIBLE the customer service was. I will never return to this location. I am left hoping the painful symptoms of my allergy will soon pass."	2.0

The most annoying feeling in the world is waiting for your food when you're starving, while seeing other individuals who arrived/ ordered after you enjoy their meal first! When i complained to the staff asking them if they had lost my order. All they wanted to do was argue with me about how long I have been waiting! Guess they forgot to realize the receipt has the time of order on it! 29 MINUTES and 8 MINUTES is a big gap!! Ugh!!! I don't know about you but I am not a fan of eating while I am unhappy.

Appearance and cleanliness

This place is DIRTY DIRTY DIRTY... No care to the outside of the property or inside. Outside you have grease and food trails all the way to the dumpster which is open and in full view of the front door.. might consider trying to hide the garbage and buy a pressure washer or hire a weekly service. Just gross! Inside the floors were covered in rice and food all over. Worn decor the has this location screaming I'm in need of some maintenance and remodeling. Even the bricks behind the wok stations were dirty and stainless steel racks above where they are cooking your meals were cover in old dryer food! GROSS!

This is the only reason Pei Wei has my business. Food is great. When they don't mess up your order.  Out of  the last 6 visits, 3 of those times the order was incorrect. All To Go orders both placed in person and phone. You've proven that it doesn't matter. This location just does not have a good quality control. Tonight your manager comes out to us as we were waiting for our TO GO order, an apologizes that the kitchen made the order wrong and it was being remade. I was great...yet again another bad experience, to try to make it right she did give us $20 gift card. Where this manager failed is my order when I pulled it out of the bag at home ...WAS WRONG! YES, all that extra wait and I still had to call and eat a meal I did not order, WTF! How does this happen, receipt clearly states shrimp and steak. No shrimp whatsoever that I paid extra for. 

If you do not fix this locations problems, I see it closing. I spoke w my neighbors and they said they don't eat there either because of similar experiences. Such a shame.

Round trip is about 7+ miles in rush hour traffic. I asked for the order to be remade and I will return the original (now cold) order. I was very rudely refused.

Last time I was here they gave me the regular, gluten-laden Spicy Chicken by mistake which was easily remedied since I was there physically. The manager apologized profusely and made me a new meal quickly. Today the girls from my office placed an order of maybe 4 meals including mine which was GF. They brought the lunch back to the office as we only have a limited time to eat. When I discovered my chicken was breaded I called and spoke to the manager who was rather rude and copped a tude with me. Additionally he offered no apology whatsoever. He went on to say he personally bagged my order asking how I could tell the order was not GF. [Really? How does a manager not know this?!]  He offered only a refund of my money. After he processed my credit he immediately hung up. So I guess I get to be hangry the rest of the day lol. At least it's Friday right?! 
Very. Poor. Customer service. Not to mention lack of food knowledge of the restaurant he manages is a real shame. Shows he has not been adequately trained and doesn't give a hoot about the GF issue or customers. The manager SHOULD have taken this as a learning experience and educated himself and his staff but sadly, he chose not to. Hangry Donna will not be back to any Pei Wei's in the future and wrote this Yelp review instead. Hangry Donna's coworkers are staying clear of her this afternoon.

My wife had the Honey Chicken. She loved the flavors. Sweet but not overly. You can still enjoy it without being in a sugar shock as many place do. On her dish she went with a small. It would have been nice to know that a small is a child's size plate. Expecially after we were asked if we had been there before and said no.

First, I walk in thinking it would at least be sit down, but no... it's a fast food.  You have to go to the counter.  I guess the new terminology that folks are using in order to convince white yuppies with money is 'fast casual.'  Not fast food - fast casual.  I guess the difference is that they bring the food to your table.  Well, isn't that a fancy cup of hot tea.

And then there's the menu, which bring up the question.  What do you get when you cross a Panda Express with another Panda Express?  You get this craphole called Pei Wei, at twice the price.  

And how do you pronounce it?  PeeWee?  Is that supposed to be cute?  Hello Kitty, meet average corporate Asian dump.

But what bugs me the most is I saw what type of clientele this place attracted.  The same folks who would scream at forking over an extra buck at a locally owned Asian restaurant are giving away the bank for bland, typical, run of the mill food that you could find at your local Dennys.  White people just piss me off... and I can say that because I'm white.  

You didn't see Asians in there.  You didn't see any Latinos, and you certainly didn't see any Black folk.  All you saw were a bunch of white preptards that would fit in nicely at a Jeff Foxworthy concert.  ""You know your a redneck when... you eat at Pei Wei Asian dinner and you really think you are getting a taste of real Asian culture.  Hell yeah!""

I know how you are, thinking that you are going to teach your kids what real Asians eat and in a environment that is true to the Asian culture and you'll show your little snot head kids how to eat with chopsticks so they can learn to become the brain dead pretentious adults that their parents have become but in fact they know just as much about true culture as a plastic fork.

I will tell you that the lettuce wraps were good, and I think the best thing I had from them that day, I also had some of the spicy orange chicken and that lacked flavor and chicken, It felt like I was eating a ball of dough, covered with sauce and with the minimal amount of chicken on it, and the pork egg roll, was not that tasty neither was the fried rice.

Tonight was a night like any other, I called and ordered our food like I usually do, I pick it up and go home. All seems well. 
I open the containers and am less than thrilled. 
The fried rice is clumped together in balls and not covered in sauce. The egg is burnt and stinks. 
Chow mein looks bland but ok, I take a bite... what is even more bland then bland you ask..... this chow mein. The ""chicken"" if that's what it actually was, was hard and dry and inedible, as if it had been re heated 10x over. The shrimp I had added looked as if they had once been battered but now looked like slime covered yuck. 
My instant pack ramen noodles have more flavor and I am pissed I wasted my money and even more pissed that I purchased food to feed my family including my children and this was the garbage I was given.

I went here for dinner and right when I walk in, the place was warm. Not sure if it was because of the kitchen being so close to the seating area, but it felt nicer outside. The floors were messy. When we were looking for a seat, my girlfriend stepped on a fortune cookie and veggies that were left by a previous customer. There were food on the floor from different dining stations, not just our area. 

Now onto the food..
We got Teriyaki Crunch Roll for sushi. It was cold, the wasabi looked like play doh that a child rolled up into a ball, and they had extra wasabi drizzled underneath the sushi. Not everyone is a fan of wasabi, so they should not put the sushi on top of drizzled liquid wasabi. We could have had better sushi elsewhere. I would compare it to sushi you can buy at a supermarket. 

We also got Mongolian Beef. Usually it is cooked just like the P.F. Chang recipe. Thick, juicy, with a little bit of a crisp, added with mushrooms and green onions . However, I'm not sure if they changed the recipe or the cooks didn't cook it correctly. The beef was cooked with a little pink left in them, which isn't bad. It was soft.. too soft. The beef was very chewy. The green onions were also soggy. 

The Traditional Lettuce wrap was okay. Not much complain there.

Not overly upset about that we sat down at the table. Surprise that our food arrived so quickly. I ordered the Poke bowl with brown rice and it came with white. Again not a huge deal just not thrilled with lack of customer care. About 1/4 the way through my meal I got what felt like an odd feeling in my mouth. Looking closer at the bowl I saw what I believe was it burnt onion. Upon further inspection.... it was a cockroach. 

When I brought it to the attention of the management who didn't seem really all that surprised nor did he offer solution. I actually had to ask for my money back for my meal. I contacted corporate the other receipt I received on the feedback yet haven't heard word from them.

Anyways an older couple come up and ordered the young lady tells them the total and I believe the gentleman handed her a $20.00 and then went for his change. After pulling out what looked like $3.00 or more of change the young lady simple looked at him and said sorry I already put this in!

I am not sure if management or cooks have changed but their quality of food is below par and their take-out orders have been wrong several times. This time they forgot my sushi and my shrimp was battered instead of steamed...again! I am extremely disappointed as this is the 4th time my take out order was wrong and my sweet n sour shrimp tasted like old oil and vinegar. Unfortunately, management is wishy washy too in dealing with these reoccuring problems. Last time I was told I would recieve a gift card in the mail. Never happened. This time I was comped for my soup..I am taking my food back today after one bite and expect a full refund. I will go elsewhere from now on, as 4 times is no charm.	1.0

I keep trying thinking its me or a bad day and end up regretting it...throwing away cash as I dump the spring rolls cooked in old oil, the fresh rolls that are soggy, the noodle bowl that tastes like rubber noodles....so sad what happened to the quality. Today was my last try.	1.0

The location and restaurant appearance is nice and was clean and comfortable BUT the food was a huge disappointment.  I saw the pictures of each dish and selected the Pei Wei spicy with chicken and looked like it was stir fried with lettuce cups instead of the rice.  What I got was 6 pieces of chicken swimming in thick gooey sauce that looked jelly-like with 3 slices of carrots so thin you hardly can see them in the sauce and snap peas.  I didn't see all this sauce in the picture and I know it doesn't always look like the picture but it was like I ordered a soup.  The sauce was supposed to be spicy, hence the name but it was more sweet than anything.  

I wanted to complain but I had an infant with me and difficult to carry her around with my plate but when a server came by and asked how everything was, I told her I was disappointed and she grabbed my plane and walked away. I thought perhaps she was going to get the manager but waited outside 15 minutes and no one ever came back out.

A very sad version of Asian American food and will probably continue going to PF Changs rather than Pei Wei in the future."	2.0

While I honestly think  the quality of food, taste and service has sharply declined at all Pei Wei restaurants , it is most apparent at this one. Upon walking into the restaurant, the boards were dimly lit and one of them was not working. In addition, the restaurant was in shambles. There was food all over the floors and on the tables. My son and I actually had to wipe rice off of one of the tables to sit down to eat. When our food arrived, it was unrecognizable. We both had ordered to the Orange Peel  Chicken. They must've change the recipe because it was grilled and didn't have any orange peelings on the plate. In addition, the sauce was runny and the chicken was so black it was burnt. I have never had such horrible food at this restaurant so I'm extremely disappointed. In addition, the soda machine was almost out of all the different types of soda. After taking two bites of our food, I asked to speak with the manager, and I told him that I was really disappointed with the food and the appearance of the restaurant. I asked for my money back, which he refunded my entire meal, so I was very appreciative of that. However, I know PeiWei in general is in decline, and I they are moving their corporate office out of state and away from Phoenix. I also know that they've had about four CEOs in the past three years or so. They just can't seem to get their act together. I will probably not go back to this restaurant again, as it was such a disappointing experience. What is going on with these restaurants? They used to be a great place for me to take my family, enjoy a good meal and appreciate clean ambiance. Now, they have turned into the sad little ""me too"" Asian restaurants that don't do anything for me. Very sad. So long Pei Wei... I would not recommend eating at this one, or probably any others. They seem to be in a huge decline and I will be surprised if they stay in business for another year."	1.0

Gave up at that point. Called the restaurant the next day and the manager said I could drive back over and he would give me a gift card. I said I lived far away and just wanted a refund for the part I did not receive. He said he was too busy to do that but I could call back at another time. Bottom line is that I was too busy to make 3 trips across town for a simple order.  I never got refunded for the error nor did I get the gift card.	2.0

The last time I called ahead to see if they had any sushi rolls and the gal said yes, after the girl confirmed what they types they had available i asked her to give me a break down of what they had in them.

The driver who took my order said I was the only order and it would take 60 minutes for 2 cheese pizzas.  Worst of all, when the pizzas arrived, they looked like they were dropped on edge a few times.  One of the slices on one pizza was folded over.  The other pizza had half of the pizza slide over to the other side so the cheese was missing from half of the pizza and the stuffed crust was wedged over.  How bad do you have to be to deliver 2 easy cheese pizzas?  Worst service I have ever had from ANY pizza establishment.  I am afraid to eat the pizza now.

I went inside instead of the drive thru because I like to replace my biscuit with a small bun so I can make my own chicken sandwich with mash and gravy on it. (I know, kinda weird). Every KFC I go to has such a problem with this, its unbelievable. This store in particular just really pissed me off because when i asked Gloria if she could do that, she gave me a dumbfounded look and in a rude way said ""ummm, hold on"" and then had to ask 2 other people. Then those other 2 people looked over at me and then laughed to Gloria and said ""i guess"". Gloria was the cashier that day and was a sour puss the moment we walked in, so her attitude had nothing to do with my so-called complicated order. She didnt greet me and my boyfriend when we walked in, she just stood at the register staring at us until we ordered. My boyfriend had the doublicious sandwich, which he barely ate because it was so disgusting. The bun was ice cold but had grill marks in it, so most likely it was just sitting there for a while. The cheese wasnt melted at all, and the only thing that was warm was the chicken and that was just as big as a silver dollar!! I ordered the 2 piece boneless chicken breast meal. Of course, instead of subsituting my biscuit with the snacker bun, I got charged 1.50 for the bun. Gloria didnt ask me if I wanted dark and white meat, so when I realized that one piece was dark, I asked if it was possible that I can have 2 white meat pieces. She had an attitude about that too and rolled her eyes as she walked away with my meal to replace the dark meat piece. It took her forever to come back with my meal and im 100% positive she gave me the smallest pieces of chicken in the batch. My chicken was so dry, i almost choked on it. The only thing that was good was the mashed potatoes and gravy. No one said thank you or have a good day as we left either. We paid $16 for one of the worst meals ever. I will never go back to this KFC again. Im not even sure if I will go to any KFC anymore. Their prices are way too high for the quality of food and the customer service sucks!

I had the sliced brisket on a bun and it was fantastic. i also had a burger that was clearly a frozen patty on a bun, whatever, my bad for ordering a burger from a bbq place, lesson learned. The highlight of this meal however was the festival, which was pretty much beans and rice. I liked it so much that i ordered from them a second time.

This time however my order was placed at 5:22 and i did not receive it until past 8 o'clock. When i did receive it, i again loved the festival but had a major problem with the full rack of St Louis style ribs i ordered. They had no sauce! I asked the delivery driver about that and she said that was what St Louis style meant.. No sauce, I'm no expert but every time i've had those style of ribs they had sauce and if you wikipedia it that style is known for having almost too much sauce.

I also ordered a pound of brisket because of my previous experience with it and again there was no sauce. Also it was not trimmed so half of the brisket was non-edible fat. super disappointing! I don't know if they just ran out of BBQ sauce this time and decided, screw it this guy only spent 65 dollars with a 10 dollar prepaid tip so who cares he already paid, lets get it out to him quickly(sarcasm) he won't notice."	3.0

 My intentions here are not to be a critical foodie, but 30 years worldwide in  the food industry has allowed me to know the food business well so I want to be truthful , but blunt here. Phoenix deserves better, no matter what neighborhood it's in. ordered  candied yams, was told no longer making because of lack of orders, which a customer doesn't want to hear...My solution...change the recipe and give out samples, downsize the prepping but always carry what you have on your menu...or post a sign saying you are out....No one wants to know the reason..unless you sold out because it is so good. Macaroni was rubbery embarrassment. Sauce was not original and we ended up throwing everything away because we were afraid we would get sick.

I am originally from Jackson, Mississippi @ www.mississippicomebacksauce.com which is nestled between Memphis and New Orleans, I know good food from the inside and the outside.

The obvious is the entirely unacceptable wait for food. I ordered on GrubHub (which I do often) at 2:18pm, my estimated delivery was 3:45pm-3:55pm
Seemed a little long but its BBQ and red velvet cake with corn bread and mac n cheese so has to be worth some wait, and I am near a college campus so OK.

4:00pm rolls by and I call the restaurant. At first it goes directly to VM. OK, this isn't good so I call again and I get put on hold. Once the gentlemen finally picks up Im told it will be 15-20 minutes for my order and he apologizes for the delay. OK no problem.

I decide to hop on Yelp and look at the reviews, as when I ordered I was starving so just picked a place (I'm still starving as I write this first part). I see the wait is not uncommon. In fact its the norm.

4:20pm rolls by and I message GrubHub. Within 2 minutes I had a text and email stating I should have my food by 4:32pm ...its 4:29pm as I type this. They gave me an extra 10.00 in food, which I appreciate and realize its not their fault my food is late but with all these issues piling up you would think they might get the hint to discontinue business with this place.

Review of food:

Hot Links - Sauce was spicy and good so was the hotlink the bun was crunchy on the edges link it was over microwaved.

Mac N Cheese - Bland. Its a shame too there is so much you can do with Mac N Cheese.

Cornbread Muffin - Decent taste, horrible consistency. I don't expect my Cornbread to be chewy.

Red Velvet Cake - Cake was moist and it was good but it had an after taste like the cream cheese had been wrapped in plastic wrap too long

You should never order from here because it will not get to you for at least two hours. I did it twice, thinking that the first 90-minute wait was a fluke. The 2nd time, it took 2 hours and 30 minutes.  And they may say the word ""sorry,"" but they say it in the same tone as ""I don't understand the problem,"" so it really doesn't matter.  And they're not going to discount your bill for this unexplained, extreme lateness.  And don't expect your delivery person to use mapquest; you'll have to talk them through the directions until the food arrives.

I don't know if it was just the employees working today or if it was the restaurant as a whole. But this has been by far the worst experience. I have never seen such lack of customer service in my life. First of all it was very very messy and sloppy. The first employee in the line was slopping everything into the bowl. I specifically asked for half and half beans in my salad and she proceeded to ignore and only give me pinto. Then the second employee in the line disregarded the fact that I asked for red salsa and she decided to put green instead. I then, told her that I asked for red not green and she said ""oh sorry"" and didn't even offer to remake it. When I asked for cheese i pointed to the yellow shredded cheese but she put the crumbled cheese instead. Which might I add, was on the complete other side of what I pointed to. Then finally when I asked for queso I had to ask her multiple times to put more. I would be completely fine with paying extra for a little more queso. The employees were rude by ignoring my requests and acting bothered by them. I am not one for confrontation and know that they are young and are gonna mess up, but this was just too much.

The boy behind the glass didn't know what he was doing or didn't care because he put so much water from the beans onto my tortilla then scooped entirely too much chicken onto the sloppy, wet beans and tortilla. I told him it was way too much and he put it back in the chicken container (not sure if you're supposed to do that). When we got to the salsa I asked if it was hot or mild and he replied, ""I don't know."" I kind of giggled and said ""ok then."" My tortilla was wet and soggy but the food was good. We got chips and queso so I just turned my meal into nachos basically.

I have tried this location 2x and both times my food has been cold, the restaurant its self is dirty, and you can tell the staff doesn't want to be there. I ordered a sweet pork quesadilla today for lunch, straight forward nothing else added and yet it was almost inedible because the pork was  so dry and the cheese was cold and hard. AND it was put on a wheat tortilla, if i'm going to Cafe Rio i'm not looking to cut calories-eww. Will not go back and will stick with the Chandler Blvd and the Gilbert mall locations.	0.0

This group has a bad habit of not making reservations, but they did this time and we got a great seatting arrangement in the very front of the restaurant where no one could miss us right when you walk in which was perfect as people would come a go throughout the hours that we were there.

When my husband and I arrived, we found seats and started being social. After about 15 minutes, we saw the waitress come by to bring the check for a couple of people (we were late because we were waiting out a flash food alert up in PV). We made eye contact and held the menu in our hands to indicate our interest in ordering. We weren't too hungry and we were having fun so we were patient and understanding that she might just be super busy at this moment. After doing that for about 20 minutes, happy hour was coming to an end and we wanted to throw in our order before that happened so we went up to the bar to order. They got pissy with us, but when we explained the 40 minute wait, they worked with us and told us to continue the order and cash out with her. 

Some time later, we were still having fun and I wanted another drink. I snapped out of my conversation and noticed that it had been an hour with not as much as a water refill so I started making direct eye contact with the waitress again and trying to speak with her when she would pass. When that didn't work I went back to the bartender so see if we could cash out there. He told us he would get her attention and a couple minutes later our bills were at the table without as much as a word from the waitress when she dropped it off. She did however take the time to write ""Thanks! "" on the bill. 

I will happily admit that I can't stand Mill or most of Tempe for that matter and I was already not happy to be treking down south to a college town, but I wanted to send my friend off right so I sucked it up, paid for parking, and was extra careful to watch out for student driving and homeless people. This rating doesn't just apply to the Tempe location. I went to the Scottsdale one in my part of town and didn't have this bad of experience, but the staff was slow and seemed to be bothered by our orders. 

The food is great though so I'll likely return and not put up a fuss next time someone wants to go here. I will however start being more honest with my tips since this is directly a wait staff problem. In summation, if you want amazing drinks, good food, and can put up with bad service come to Zipps and have a zipparita cause they are the best."	0.0

After waiting almost an hour, which was fine, the hostess took us to our table where we ordered drinks and our dinner. The drinks came and then the manager for our section came to our table and accused us of sneaking in and swiping it. He didn't believe us when we said this is where the hostess sat us. He wanted our beeper number!  Which we gave him. Instead of just asking the hostess in the first place he decided to accuse his customers of stealing a table. After he verified we were legit he stayed away from our table. A simple ""sorry guys"" would have sufficed. The waitress was good and the food was good though. They did charge extra for the Caesar dressing for the chicken Caesar I had. We won't come back."	3.0

Instead of hiring great managers and great people, they must have fired eveyone in training with a brain cause the management here is overrated.    They need to be fired and replaced. 

I have given this place 3 official visits for drinks and food and a few times for drinks each time something wasn't quite right.    First the opened the new place understaffed,  unlike most places who open overstaffed and weed out the bad employees.    They decided to open in March, Arizona's busiest month with Spring Training and they open the week of March Madness.     

The bar seats 30 plus people around a huge horseshoe bar plus about 200 general seating, there was only one  bartender working and one covering the well.    They needed 2 more bartenders,  I waited 10 minutes to get greeted and another 5 mintues for a water and beer,  then took 15 minutes for all three guys on my side to order.    The food came in 20-25 minutes a bit long for just wings, but the wings were good as always.   Good to see they brought the same golden sauce from their other locations.  Order the wings if you want to be happy here. 

Next visit - the place was half empty and service at a table sucked we came in at 7pm and wanted to catch an 8pm movie at the new AMC Centerpointe.   Of course we told our waitress and ordered right away , but food took over 30 minutes.    We only ordered chicken fingers and wings.   The breading on the chicken fingers was a bit soggy and heavy.   The beer batter is too much.   

Last visits we had the worst Manager on the planet give us attitude about walking by the bar on the way to the bathroom.   They don't have any signs at sight level saving the area is off limits , they need to add some swinging doors.    His name was Jason, but frankly all the managers I dealt with or spoke with that night had the same attitude that they didn't care much.   They were too busy to care about giving good service.     I will avoid this bar,   hopefully the summer kills them and they close within a few years,  like Uno's before them or Tavern down the street.   I would rather go see the dbags at el Hefe that support bad management.  

This place is to be avoided , try any other place on Mill.   or another location of Zipps in town."	2.0

There's a lot of talent in the mill Ave area and this place is the local baby mama day job. Get some energetic, outgoing, ambitious employees who actually want to be there. The food is terrible but it's a cheap sports bar you get what you pay for. If you order a slide of pizza it comes on a TORTILLA!Went to another Zips locations and the service was much better.

I love zipps and frequent the other locations quite often, gave it a shot on a saturday afternoon, sat at the bar, and literally waited 20 mins before i was even noticed. (Not exaggerating) ordered a zipparita with chambord, delicious,  always are, then asked for a menu and got a sigh like i was a bother to her by asking for a menu, (brunette with a hat) ordered the buffalo shrimp with blue cheese, and when it arrived, there was no buffalo sauce at all, (they are supposed to be tossed in it) or blue cheese as it comes with on the menu, at this point i flag down my server, and ask for buffalo sauce and once again i felt as though i was bothering her by asking her for items that i ordered and never received.  The bill comes, my margarita was charged full price.  They were on special saturday before 4.. and was charged for extra sauces.. and it was supposed to come with my order hence the name buffalo shrimp. How can you charge extra for something that is part of the order? Very disappointed.  A call to weights and measures will be made. We wont be back to this location.	2.0

First, the wing selection is decent. Nothing earth shattering, but good quality wings. The sides are a bit skimpy and the wait staff is friendly. 

As for the evening experience, you may want to venture to another location. My waitress during the evening had to apologize several times because of the poor bartender service and slow kitchen. This time I brought a friend because of the good lunch service. That service quickly turned sour and habitually slow. After being seated it took nearly 20 minutes to have any waitress to ask what we would like to order. Our mixed drinks appeared approximately 20 minutes later. That was 40 minutes without drinks. Food arrived about 30 minutes after our drinks arrived. This means we waited over an hour to be served wings. There was no excuse because the place wasn't filled with many customers. In fact, many left because of the slow service. 

Typically I would give balanced high marks because of a previous experience. But this location has lots of growing to do if it wishes to compete with a thriving campus community. I would highly recommend visiting for lunch but not for dinner."	2.0

So I ordered a chicken foccanio or however you say it ( I had never heard of this before coming here) it had chicken, cheese, bacon , and avocado and I got a side of onion rings. The onion rings tasted like they'd been sitting out for awhile and were hard and flavorless. The rest of my meal was ok just disappointed about the amount of avocado they put in it. But the waitress is really one of the reasons for the rating, she walked away while I was trying to ask her a question, we had to ask for Silver ware, napkins, boxes, bags, refills, etc... the fact that I had to ask two different waitresses for silverware and more napkins is a bit silly.

When it came to tab out we were told by the manager, who could only look at the ground and not at our faces as he told us, that they do not split the tab even though they let two people tab out early and somehow split their Checks from the rest of ours. He then told us to do the math and write down what we want to go to each card. After seeing we were getting pretty upset our server came over and said this is how it's always been and that it even says it on the menu, but we never got menus or told that they don't spit tabs. Then she also had the nerve to tell us that the manager was making an exception for us. I guess having us split up our own checks for them is making an exception for us.

Where do I start:

We came this weekend, yes during the Tempe Arts Fest, but I was surprised at how not crowded it was, I have seen this place packed before for big games,.. but not this day, easy to get a table. So we find a table no problem, but it hasn't been cleaned yet, dirty plates and napkins on it, no big deal, but 10-15 minutes go by and no one has come by. Finally we stop a waitress and she apologizes and takes our order. We asked for two waters and a pitcher of Ranger. A few minutes later a lady comes with one 32 oz beer, nope we ordered a pitcher. Okay no big deal again..  and then the pitcher comes. Then we see her 10 minutes later and I ask for waters again, still nothing. Finally I was so thirsty I went up to the bar to order a water. Then we decided the slowness is crazy so we get the bill since we had to catch the light rail to Chase Field. We get the check & she didn't charge us the correct price for the pitcher, $15 instead of $10 (HH).. oh and that's all we got so its not like it was too challenging. So my bf goes and tells her the price is incorrect. Then I get the check back, and she ran my card for $25.. I'm guessing the $10 + $15? I was like oh my goshhhh how can this lady be SO bad at her job???? Like at least can someone tell us she's new or something?Then I would be way more understanding.

Their reasoning was that they are missing out on revenue. We even told them we will buy a beer for each of the missing people so they won't miss out... they didn't find that too funny. 

As for our server, she forgot to bring lemons to my friend after being asked numerous times, wrong orders were brought out, and when we asked about one of our beers, she said ""it's probably at the bar"" and didn't bother to go get it.

473	hmYnzs8-aHbltaOOGDgmbA	1.0	1.0	1.0	"I've never thought very highly of this establishment, but the main reason I'm giving such a low review is due to a very frustrating experience during my last visit.

I will start my review with what I think of the place overall. The food is mediocre at best and sometiemes comes out cold, leaving you wondering why it costs 2x more than most nearby places serving similar--but cheaper and higher quality--items (e.g. five guys, jimmy johns, etc.). The service varies from good to very poor. The only redeeming quality I found is the enormous and plentiful TVs on which to watch your favorite sport, as well as the lively ambiance, especially during important sporting events.

Now I'd like to detail my last experience, which is the main reason that I will never again give this place my business. I visited Zipps with a few friends in January 2016 for an NFL playoff game. The bad part began when halfway into the game I started to feel very sleepy due to lack of sleep the night before. I would have simply paid for my food and driven home if I had not been assigned designated driver for our group that day, so I decided to escape the loudness of the bar by moving to a table just outside, on their patio, a few feet from where my friends were watching the game. I figured I'd put my head down and rest my eyes at one of the many open tables on the patio (most customers were sitting inside watching the game) while my friends enjoyed the rest of the game, but about a minute into closing my eyes I was startled by an aggressive push on my shoulder and opened my eyes to a man standing over me, loudly and rudely telling me that I can't sleep out there. He then tried to tell me to leave. I understand that bars watch out for people who are sleeping because this means they may have had too much to drink; however, I wasn't even drinking and regardless of whether or not I was intoxicated it was an incredibly rude way for an employee to address a customer. He tried to get me to leave as if I was an unwanted freeloader using their tables for sleep, but I told him, much to his disbelief, that I was a paying customer and then went over and joined my friends inside. At this point I was incredibly frustrated by the way I was treated but decided not to complain or do anything about it so as not to create an awkward situation for my friends who were still enjoying the game.

A little while later, as we were watching the 4th quarter, we noticed a homeless man wandering from table to table, being loud and belligerent and asking customers for money and cigarettes. He eventually made his way to our table and started talking to us, asking for money and cigarettes and making crass jokes. We wanted to ask him to leave so we could get back to watching our game but were intimidated by his large stature and obvious state of inebriation. We also didn't ask him to leave because we figured that was up to the employees/bouncers. The bouncers were definitely keeping an eye on him but even after an hour of him making customers visibly uncomfortable they never did anything. By the end of the game he finally left on his own, without purchasing anything.

I just found it so ironic that while he was not a paying customer who was clearly intoxicated and belligerent, the management completely left him alone. Meanwhile, I was a paying customer just minding my own business and yet I was the one who was harassed and treated like I shouldn't be there. I think the bouncers were too afraid to confront this man who rivaled them in physical strength but since I was much smaller than them they felt it was okay to treat me poorly.

I complained to some employees as we were leaving, letting them know how I was treated outside and that we were disappointed the bouncers didn't do their job when it actually mattered. They looked at me as if I was stupid for complaining and simply justified their actions. They basically said the employee was justified in rudely telling me to leave since I could have been intoxicated while also justifying the bouncers actions by saying that the belligerent man left on his own anyway (mind you, this was after over an hour of harassing customers). At this point I realized just how pointless it was to complain since they care so little about their customers and just decided my best course of action would be to leave and never give them my business again--and that's what I did. I haven't been their in months and I feel great about it. There are much better places to get a beer and watch the game anyway."	4.0

Both the fries and onion rings were extremely overcooked to the point where we could not even finish it. As for the chicken sandwich it was borderline inedible and it was a struggle to finish. My friend ordered a burger and ushered pretty much the same thoughts to me about his meal, He did finish his burger though but certainly not without a struggle.

Ordered a Michalobe Ultra and it came to me with at least an inch of beer missing from the top. And it came the second and third again like that.

Our server was a young lady who totally screwed up our order. We ordered Nachos but we're brought out chips and salsa and when we informed her the waitress that she had order wrong she got upset with us and tried to convince us we ordered chips and salsa instead. We then refused the chips and then she informed us that we order both chips and salsa and Nachos which makes no sense. She was upset and stormed away, we then was waiting on our complete order which was Nachos, and two order of wings. It took a very long time for order to come out so we told a waitress to please cancel our order then we begin to leave. While walking out with my daughter still hungry three guys literally ran out as soon as we stepped out of the restaurant and told us that we didn't pay for our order and tried to make me Pat for something we never received and was rude in front of my daughter. I then begin to get pissed and told the 3 guys that not only was we not going to pay for a meal that we never received, we were not ever going to revisit because of bad service. One of the guys two of the guys then said we order chips and salsa and didn't pay for it as well, the same chips and salsa we sent back the guys brought back up and said that we ordered them and we know it, in a very rude way and all in front of my daughter who's a minor. I tinformed the guys that we did not order the chips nor did we receive our food and we cancelled the order well before it came out and by the way they knew the order have not came out because as they were trying to intimidate me into paying for an order we didn't receive they told me that the order was almost ready and I need to pay. Now not only did I cancel because order still was not out bug the 3 guys still hadn't brought out an order that was ready even to try to satisfy us but instead carried on about me paying for something they knew we didn't receive and was still not prepared. I told them I'm not paying and to tone down their voices in front of my daughter, then one of the guys begin to go back and forth with me about me not canceling the order and I should pay and remember the food still was not out. It was when one of the guys said he understood after all the arguing right out in front of the establishment. After all of the confusion and just as we were walking off one of the guys stated that j needed to pay because I didn't cancel the order and begin again to raise his voice and that's when I raised mine and stated again I wasn't paying and he needed to watch his tone in front of my daughter who witnessed this madness.
In all we didn't receive our food and we were harassed about paying for food we never received and our waitress lied on us stating we never canceled even know that food had never came out and it was everest told it was ready. They are terrible with their service and try to make you pay even when you cancel and never receive your food. I would not recommend this place but it's a business and I to am a business owner so I suggest that you experience for your self and judge because that was my experience which j felt we were also targeted. The most rude out of the three guys was the black guy, and the other two were white so I think the black guy had something to prove by being extra rude even after the other two had apologized for the problem."	1.0

i pushed my friends together and decided to drag them out on a tuesday night. they weren't too keen on the idea of grabbing a beer, but i convinced them

all three of us were out of town-ers. 
two from california, one from utah. 

the bartender told me that they didn't accept vertical ID's. I told her it was clearly a real ID (the new CA ID's are impossible to counterfeit). I had multiple credit cards, and even a medical insurance as well as car insurance  card to prove that I was indeed the person on the ID card. Bartender said no, I said let me speak to the manager. 

the manager took his time getting over to us, i watched him from behind the bar. i remember his name to be deshawn, but i could be wrong. 
i explained to him that i was from out of town, had my credit cards, my insurance card and my medical insurance card. it was clear I was sober and not looking to create a fuss, just was trying to have a beer. instead of making the manager decision that it was totally appropriate to serve me, he tells me he will need to ""call the hire ups"". AS IF I WANT TO WASTE ANYMORE TIME WAITING AROUND TO FIND OUT IF I WAS APPROVED. so i left. went to the nearest bar, next door had a great time there. the manager on duty who was also the bouncer informed me that he wasn't allowed to accept vertical ID's, but since i was clearly sober and very clearly the person on the ID that stated i was 2-fricking-3 years old, there would be no issue.

I had a wonderful time at the bar next door, i believe it was called the handle bar. don't waste your time with incompetent managers who can't make decisions for the facility themselves. please. that is your job, to manage and make decisions when your boss isn't around, not so you can take your time calling someone for a question you can clearly handle yourself.

Came in on a Thursday night with 6 people. We were seated and then left for literally 25 min. I had to walk up to a bartender to get them to send someone over to take our order. Our orders were taken and our food took a substantial amount of time. Obviously there were a lot of us, so this was expected. Our food came out cold. I got a 1000 Island burger with fries and onion rings. The bottom half of my bun was so soggy it fell apart the second I picked it up. I asked for another bun and they replaced it. Everyone's fries were cold, not lukewarm, completely cold. No one came over to check how we were doing or to re-fill drinks. They were not understaffed either. A lot of servers were just standing around talking about our table specifically. We could tell because they were pointing and glaring. Finally when our server came over to ask if we were ready for our checks, my friend said she didn't want to pay for her fries because they were cold. The server went and ranted to her manager right in front of us, pointing and making annoyed facial expressions towards our table. They took off $1.50 for her fries. I was charged for a soda I did not order and she said she would take it off when she took my card. I was still charged for the soda when she returned with my receipt. The server had to go back and fix the total she charged me. She was not apologetic and not once did a manager come over to speak to our table. Never going back. Do not waste your time or money. I could've gone to In-N-Out and gotten a better and cheaper burger and would've saved myself an hour and a half of torture. This was the most unprofessional establishment I have ever been to.

However over that time things have really gone downhill especially at the Tempe location.  To start, the manager is problematic.  Here's the story - I'm from Back East and where I'm from only one condiment goes on wings and it is bleu cheese.  When I started going to Zipps they had the best in the area.  At some point they decided to replace it with ranch with crumbles on top.  Why?  Who knows but it's the case at every location.  So my colleagues and I went there for lunch one day about a year ago and I order the buffalo chicken salad and specified that I wanted bleu cheese on it.  It came drenched in ranch - my colleagues all tried it and agreed it was definitely not bleu cheese.  I asked the waitress to take it back and she gave us the impression that she had heard this complaint a number if times.  Then something happened I've never seen before - the manager brought me back the same dish, put it back in front of me and insisted it was bleu cheese.  I disagreed and he offered a solution to the dispute by saying ""I can bring you the container and you'll see it says bleu cheese.""  I thought I had transported into the scene from Tommy Boy where he talks about slapping a guarantee on the box - it has to be your bull.

Look, if you want to replace your bleu cheese with inferior product just go ahead and do it, but don't lie to your customers when they call you out on your BS.  I'm not sure if there is some sort of bleu cheese shortage or Mr. Valentine from Trading Places is driving the cost up on the commodities market or something but it just makes you look like a fool when you try to tell your customers something like that.  

Another time we had a group of about 8 getting together to watch the ACC tournament - five of us got there earlier than the other 3 so we pushed two hi-tops together.  The manager came over and said he could not ""give up"" the table.  Bear in mind the one we grabbed was closest to the door and multiple groups had looked at it and walked out the door instead of sitting there but he could not afford to let us take such a money maker.  Also, we were clearly dressed professionally and were obviously ready to drop a siginficant amount of money watching 4 hours of hoops.  Anyway....he asked us when the other 3 were going to show and I said like 20 minutes.  He said he could ""give"" me 15, then came over after 5 and moved the table back while our collective jaws hit the floor.  When the next guy came, he sat alone at that table, ordered nothing but water and we proceeded to talk loudly between the tables to mock what was going on until the other two arrived and we were ""allowed"" to abscond with the table.  Our waitress was even laughing at how stupid the whole thing was. Except for what has become known amongst my friends as The Bleu Cheese Incident I've never seen such unprofessional behavior from someone in the service industry.

- The bar said they were out of Bloody Mary mix - meanwhile, we see a bartender pouring it
- They said they were out of sourdough, although several items on the menu state that they come with it. They replaced with a bun without asking. 
- The food took more than an hour to come out.
- one sandwich was forgotten. After mentioning it twice, 1/2 hour after everyone else got their food, a manager finally came out to ask if we'd gotten it (we hadn't). He never said I'm sorry - just said, ""I'll check.""
- The food was gross.  Most meals were in edible. The nachos were terrible - had a pool of grease left at the bottom. 
- The drinks were so weak, we watched the bartender pour.  He did put one splash of alcohol - not even close to a shot pour.  We demanded new drinks.  
- After a comprehensive discussion about splitting the bill three ways before ordering, one bill was delivered.  The waitress proceeded to ask all the same questions as before, but had each of us review what we ate. 
- 4 of 6 in our group said its the worst meal we've had in a long time, if not ever. No apologies were ever given and definitely no offers of a comping a single item.. We will never ever eat at Zipps again. Yuk!"	4.0

(I was at the Camelback location for the early games) I felt about as welcome as I do everywhere else on this empty Mill Avenue.  I am returning to AZ for 5 days after moving away a few years ago. I walked through the front door. Two waitresses chatted away without acknowledging me. I walked 15 feet into the bar area. I had a dumbfounded look on my face as there was no seating. I looked at the NFL football above me. A man in with the Zipps logo on his Golf shirt walked by me without a peep. I walked the other side of the bar. Miss  Leany-Poo was working. She continued her lean. She looked very comfortable. I wanted to be as comfortable as her eating some Zipps wings watching NFL football. After receiving no assistance,I sat myself at a larger table. I sat for 5 minutes with a parched throat. Tell the waitress wearing number 11 that I tip better than the students that sat there after me. The polo shirt guy came by and he wound up being the clown manager. He came over and said I couldn't sit there. I hate being asked to move. I am glad hospitality is alive and well on Mill. I am glad hospitality is alive and well in Arizona. Good bye Zipps on Mill.	0.0

Of the three of us, we each intended to order a pitcher of beer to share. We were also going to order food throughout. However, once our first pitcher, ziparita, and wings came out we never saw our server again. She was nowhere to be found... until we saw her watching the football game. By the time she came back it had been 20-30 minutes and we no longer had time for more food or drinks. I asked to speak to a manager then waited for another 15 minutes. The manager never came over.

We decided to hit up Zipps Saturday evening thinking it'd be the best place to catch both of our college football games (Texas A&M and ASU) since they have about a bajillion TVs. We sat at the bar for several hours, had several drinks each, buffalo wings, and a large pepperoni pizza. 

Pros: The food was pretty good. The wings were crisp but also extremely saucy. The pizza was fresh and hit the spot. Their margs were also pretty tasty. Most importantly, the TV situation here doesn't even kinda suck. There's a good size television every couple feet, which makes for optimal sports watching. And I'm not going to lie, I was pretty impressed when the 9 TVs merged into 1 giant screen when the ASU game started. I don't care who you are, that's cool! 

Cons: The service was less than acceptable. From our very first greeting, we were just appalled with the attitude of our bartender. She was extremely short with us, and just plain rude. And it didn't stop with her. Every bartender after her also had the same kind of unpleasant disposition. It's like one of them caught a severe and extremely contagious case of Resting B*tch Face and then infected the whole bunch. It got to a point where everyone around us was also talking about how they didn't appreciate the way they were being treated. 

Having lots of TVs is cool. Having decent food is also cool. But being treated with respect as a paying customer is the coolest. And in my opinion, it's the customer service that makes or breaks a place."	3.0

I finally waved down a waitress and got my beer order in. after my friend got there waved the waitress down again to get her a beer. The worst part of this I had to keep waving them down while they were just chatting with co workers. We had a couple beers and as we tried to get the check, my friend got tired of waving at the waitress who we both could have sworn was looking right at us as we were waving, and went up to the servers booth and asked her for the check.

After everyone had left and paid for their tabs, me and my friend decided get ours. To our surprise one of the individuals had left without paying for their tab, so they added it to ours!! We paid for what we had consumed but refused to pay for someone else's tab due to the lack of the waitress keeping track of her clients. Manager was called and there was no help from him either, was threatened to call the police if we did not pay. Police showed up harassing us as well to pay up. I argued to them all as to why I should be stuck paying for someone's tab and have to pay for what we did not consume! To avoid further drama and humiliation we ended up paying the measly $20 tab. Very poorly and rudely managed. Horrible experience. Will never be returning to any Zipps in the valley. Lost a great client.	0.0

I went with a few friends to the Mill location and all of them ordered the same order except for my order which was the only different of the four.  After an excess amount of wait time after ordering (a common occurrence at Zipps) the waitress returned with my three friends meals but not mine.  

After waiting another 10 -15 minutes she finally returned and when I asked where my meal was she was confused and did not have it.  So she took my order again, with attitude, and my meal wasn't brought to me until about 10 minutes after everyone I was with had already finished theirs.

When I saw a manager approaching me with the food I was expecting some type of compensation or at least an apology, however I got almost the exact opposite.  

The manager attempted to swing their mistake into blaming me for not having my food, which does not even make much sense.

You walk in and nobody greets you... they are in a constant state of ""training"" new wait staff because the manager is a total douchebag... and they are on the edge of going out of business... so the food is cheap and they ""pad the bill"" with all kinds of undisclosed up charges...

And their turnover is high because wait staff likely quit all the time because the food is such poor quality.. 

The drinks at Zipps are watered down with the cheapest well liquor... yet they charge $6-$8 for a tiny drink during happy hour... 

The chicken wings were laced with margarine hot sauce that makes your stomach rumble with each bite,... their fryer oil is filthy... the ranch is like tartar sauce and rancid tasting...

The onion rings are the most disgusting looking I've ever seen and their burger meat is cheap and raunchy tasting....

We ordered our drinks for 3 people.... and it took 3 different waitresses 25 minutes to get our drinks... We ordered drinks before 7pm on a Friday Happy hour... the place was barren and empty... Now we know why....

We were told she 'got our drinks in'.... yet they charged us full price for the drinks and included an additional $2.25 undisclosed ""upcharge for each cheap well margarita with strawberry flavor...

The food is honestly disgusting at Zipps... the onion rings come out dark brown falling apart with the cheapest batter Ive ever witnessed, the $8.99 burger comes out on a cheap deformed tiny bun you could buy at a gas station...

I complained to the manager that the burger had decomposing lettuce on it... we also explained to two waitresses and the dickhead manager that we were overcharged for drinks and 3 times they made us wait for the check...

Each time they returned and refused to correct the full price drinks from happy hour... this manager has no authority yet when we left them with ZERO tip for their dishonesty I saw them adjusting the bill to get their tip out of the cash we paid... over $50 for the worst food... My husband stopped at circle K for 1000Mg Tums on the way home from this dirty poorly run tempe location.

They offered us a coupon for a future visit... we will never return to ANY Zipps location. The manager is a total douchebag that would not even take $5 off the bill or correct the terrible food production from their lame kitchen.. I am reporting them to the health inspector because you can get food poisoning at this location... It is THAT BAD.... 

But by all means check out the deplorable service, crappy food and horrible management and staff for yourself if you like living dangerously at Zipps which makes sense cause you get zero quality food, zip nada zilch for service and they lie to you and try to pad the bill.... then the manager comes over and tells you they agree with the waitress and rip you off... lovely... 

This restaurant is the worst Ive ever eaten at in AZ period.

I would not give them even one star... Why? Because they have no business being in the hospitality industry with their negative attitudes, lack of ethic and cheap tactics...

We bought a groupon for Rosatis, it has some of the most delicious pizza on earth. We couldn't wait to take our parents who were visiting from out of town there! We do have 5 daughters as well, I am used to being very patient always having a big group. From the second we walked it was a terrible experience. I was greeted by the cashier who rolled her eyes at me when I told her we were dining it. It was 9:15 and they did close at 10. We proceeded to order about $80 worth of food. We sat and waited and waited and waited. Approx 35 minutes later I asked if we could please get the salads we ordered and maybe the wings as we waited for the pizza. The pizza does take a bit as it is Chicago style. About 10 minutes later they did bring out the salads but NO silver wear. Standing at the cash register waiting for 10 minutes for silver wear and seeing a very strange cash transaction between 2 employees one guaranteeing the other to pay the register back by morning, my step-dad jumped in and asked for silver wear, which we finally did receive.  Now it's a little past 10 and 9 very hungry people are finally being able to eat. When the grand finale FINALLY arrived a LARGE FULLY LOADED CHICAGO pizza it had sauce poring every over the table, the crust which is VERY thick was soggy and make matters worse it was barely warm. We were SO disappointed and looked forward to sharing this with our parents. My husband loves to add things like he wants bludgeon himself with a dull knife in the femur and this time I TOTALLY would agree with him.

I ordered on grub hub and went to pick up my pizza when the app said it should be ready and the first guy I talked to couldn't find the order and just walked away and went to the back.  A girl came up and looked some more but said she couldn't find the order.  I showed her the email from grub hub showing I ordered it for the correct location.  She offered to make a pizza in 20 minutes but no discount or anything else offered.  We left and went to Mod Pizza.  I doubt I'll be returning for a second try.	1.0

After placing our order we felt like deciding to eat here was a big mistake. We had to use the only menu that the restaurant had which was printed on a small flyer.After we ordered while we were waiting we saw a delivery guy running back inside to grab another half of an order that he forgot to deliver, the manager arguing with a older woman about how their coupons worked explaining that they expired a day earlier than printed, and we saw a man waiting for his order which he was told was ready for him when it was not. On top of all that we also noticed that the staff were swamped with phone calls involving  other problems customers were having. In addition, we noticed that the place was dirty seeing that tables were messy along with the floor being dusty and having bits of food on them.

Once we got home we started to un-box the food and we noticed that the order of french fries were cold and soggy. In addition our mozzarella sticks were also cold and solid rather than being stringy when being pulled apart.The pizza was likewise a disaster. The crust was bland, the sauce was mediocre, the mushrooms on our pizza were clearly canned and not fresh, and the cheese seemed to be congealed as well. A Little Caesar's Hot n Ready PIzza taste better than this. The only redeeming factor was that their pepperoni had a good flavor.  

If you are looking for good pizza in the area look up Venezia's or Geno's Pizza."	4.0

Order my usual and was told it would be 20 to 25 minutes. So I headed over at 30 minutes and was told by (Darrin I think) said that my order just came out and he'll go get it. So I waited 10 more minutes while he and a driver were chit chatting in the kitchen to get me slice and cheese sticks. When he finally handed my order to me, he offered no apology.

Once I got back to my office the order was not correct and the slice was cold. I gave them a call and Darrin tells me he's the manager, so I told him the problem. Again no apology, he just starts whining about being the only person back there with 4 orders. I explained to him getting a slice out to a waiting customer makes sense since they cool off faster than a full sized pizza. This clown goes on to tell me how difficult it is to work back there by himself and I must never have worked in the food industry before.... well, jackass, yes I have, for many years and I learned two things- how to prioritize and how to offer great customer service. 

So in trying to find a real manager to speak with I called the Val Vista store, the young ladies there had no idea what to do so they told me to call Nicole back at 5.

The wings were probably the worst part. The BBQ sauce hardly tastes like BBQ. The mild wings were flavorless even though there was a lot of sauce on them. And you could tell they just came out of the freezer after a long time in there. And for 1 small pizza, 1 medium, and 18 wings, it was 50 bucks. Way over priced.

Instead of an actual chicken breast it was about 5-6 slices of chicken about the size of my finger that were all dried out and mostly burned, also the spaghetti that was in some nasty, watery, marinara soup was burned on the top.

I was rudely told that we in fact did not and he kept arguing the point. I listened to her place a delivery order, but regardless an employee should not talk to a customer like this.

When I was asked to pay, even though I was still waiting for food the the add on side for the child's meal was missing. The girl cashiering proceeded to tell me that the side I'd put with the child's meal was added to the panda bowl and if I wanted the second added side that was missed I'd pay full price since it was now on a separate ticket. The extra item should have been $1.50, but instead she told me it would be $4.31.

When you are on a low carb diet trying to lose a few pounds (from all the buffets I have eaten over the years lol)  meat starts looking unappealing after awhile, so I usually turn to chicken wings during these trying times.  Because I cook them so much I have mastered them.  They are quite easy,  Split them, deep fry them at 375 to 400 and coat them in a sauce made with Butter and Cayenne Hot sauce.  So simple my 6 year old son can do it.  No joke.

How does Buffalo Wild Wings fuck this up?    I will tell you how.  No love and terrible tasting sauces.

First thing what kind of chicken did these wings come off of?  A BUZZARD?  They are fucking huge.  And they just taste weird.    These FRANKENSTEIN WINGS are more than double the normal size of a chicken wing.  So of course they overcooked in order to get somewhat crispy.  Naturally that just makes the meat dry and tough.

Second, when the wing is hot you pull it out of the fryer and toss it in the sauce.   Seems like here they just put them in a paper basket and pour cold thick sauce on top that tastes like over salted cheap vegetable oil, defiantly NOT BUTTER..  It complements the BUZZARD meat well considering that meat tastes like it was soaked in some kind of salt water brine to plump them up..   Hungry yet?

So you say screw it I will just dip the wing in some ranch to drown out the terrible taste and dryness of the wing.   Well guess what.  That ranch isn't fresh ranch, it is that cheap shit you buy at the store in the non fridge section that tastes like Corn Syrup and once again cheap oil.

YUM.  Sounds delicious huh?   Yeah it isn't.

Now couple all that and charge 20 bucks for 20 wings and you got Buffalo Wild Wings.   Congratulations Columbus Ohio (yes original Buffalo Wild Wings was first there) you took something amazing created in Buffalo New York and just SHIT all over it...

Let me start off by saying I love eating at Buffalo Wild Wings, especially this location, but the service I received a few months ago still has me fuming.

When my fiancé and I arrived, we were seated almost immediately. Considering it was a weekend, I was pleasantly surprised. We chose to sit on the patio. 

We sat down and were soon greeted by our server. He took our drink orders and when he returned, we were ready to order our food. After placing our order, we waited for about ten or fifteen minutes. Considering we live in Arizona, it is natural to drink a lot of fluids and in within that ten or fifteen minutes, my fiancé had finished his drink. When our food was ready, it was delivered to our table by one of the hostesses and my fiancé asked her for a refill. She politely said yes. While she was away getting his refill, I realized we didn't have any silverware, and so when she returned I asked if we could get some. She looked at the empty glass on the table, didn't take it, said ""Oh yeah"" and walked away. (Now I know all we ordered were boneless wings and celery, but due to a horrible experience at the dentist, I am unable to bite down on my front teeth; therefore, I require a fork.) After my fiancé had finished his eighth wing, and I had not had one, he left the table to get some silverware as the young girl we had asked had obviously forgot. Because he is a lot more understanding than I, he decided not to confront her and returned with some silverware and asked me to drop it. 

I was still fuming. We finished our meal and in the time we had received our food and finished, our server only walked by our table one time, not to refill our drinks, not to ask us how our food was, but instead to say ""I can't believe they forgot the silverware!"" In the words of my fiancé (who asked me to drop it) ""Good cover."" Obviously word gets around fast....and through the whole ordeal, I also needed a refill, which I never got. Please think, when was the last time you ate a a restaurant and DIDN'T get a refill...that's what I call sh*ty service. Anyways, my fiancé still gave a 15% tip. Clearly he is more understanding than I.

...and that's how no silverware, no refill and no ""how is your meal"" gets Buffalo Wild Wings at Happy Valley Road a not so great review."	1.0

I have definitely had my frustration over the years, however have consistently eaten 1-4x weekly at your locations SOMEWHERE in the country. 

There are two things on my mind tonight, one that has frustrated me with this specific location and the other pertaining to the ""sauce campaign"" you have been doing for some time now...

This location has been turning out some pretty good food and service consistently, however - PLEASE resolve to have your wi-fi fixed! This has been in disrepair for at least a couple months that I'm aware, and is extremely frustrating. 

On the ""sauce campaign""...what a flop. Get rid of your entire marketing department and all of their consulting firms. Start from scratch, and get people making those decisions that know how to think! The way you have expedited is this...you only provide enough of the sauces to last maybe a week? Honestly, a week is generous. Typically less than a week...and if the sauce has been available beyond that, I've learned that it's because its awful and noone wants it.

What's really sad is...long after the sauce is gone each month, you continue to send marketing emails to announce the new flavors, continue to keep the flyer in the menu, and keep promoting it on your Social media channels. 

Consider a campaign re-launch!"	0.0

In fact, in the last 2 days I have had poor experiences with BWW's both times resulting in me taking my business elsewhere. This location specifically turned me, my wife, and children away because my children came in with frozen Yogurt from a neighboring yogurt spot. The manager said if he let us in with the FroYo he would have to allow everybody to bring their own food in. Really?! Is BWW not confident enough in their own food offerings they feel the need to have such a policy?! They should be supporting nearby businesses as they would want the same support in their direction! Plus, they don't sell FroYo so it's not like we tried bringing in ""the competitors"" food. What they fail to realize is we would have spent an easy $50+ dollars there as a family anyway because my kids bringing FroYo would have no affect on the business we would have given them. On the other hand, because they turned us away, they lost our business (again). I would not recommend this location and starting to rethink ever recommending BWW ever!!"	1.0

I was one of the weirdos that camped out over night on the eve of the Grand Opening of this BDub years ago (number 61 in line). ""Free"" wings for a year kept me coming for the first 12 months. After that it was a sense of loyalty. Quality continued to decline and finally completely fell off the charts. After way too many consecutive bad experiences, I said no more. 

Fast forward to May 2017, I gave them another shot and it was pretty good. I thought things were back to the way they used to be. I was wrong. Today, Not only were the wings under seasoned. They were under cooked! Maybe not raw, but pretty close. When I complained, my server looked at the half eaten wing and shook her head in disgust and happily removed them from the table and the bill. I think that was only fair and appreciate her effort to correct the situation. 

But here is the funny part. She then said ""it is difficult to cook chicken wings correctly. Sometimes they leave the feathers on them.""  LOL!  When CHICKEN wings are your claim to fame, they should be perfect every time! Or maybe I should have just ordered BUFFALO.   I'm done!"	1.0

OH and our appertizer chips and salsa chips tasted stale and a few cheese sticks where missing the CHEESSE! which the server said he would get me some more and never did. When it came to the birthday shout out for my daughter they stopped half way through it and said they would be right back ???? then asked her what she wanted ... she chose chocolate cake... we got our check ..... still no cake.... we played at the toy machine ... stll no cake ... another waitress came by 3 different times and asked us if we got our cake promissed to get it.... still no cake .... asked our server 2 more times and paid our check then asked for the cake togo.... and STILL no cake. we waited about 25 minutes for her cake and had to leave with out it :( over all this was the worst experience i have ever had!	0.0

Any other manger in the restaurant business would have gone to a retail resource, but instead we get this kind of answer?

The wings were saturated in sauce, with at least 1/3 cup at the bottom of the serving basket.  For 10 wings that's an overkill.

Loud?!  You bet, we had to shout to talk to one another.

By the way, if you're really hungry and want a QUICK eat don't go here as they'll only fill your sauce half way AND change you for it. I remember when this restaurant had higher standards I can buy better frozen wings at Costco. And not get judged out the door.	0.0

The server was fast and we were able to be seated very quickly which was a an improvement over other visits in the last year. The resturaunt seemed busy but the server was fast with drinks and taking our order. We put in our order at 12:07. I was optimistic this visit and things were going really well. Then I noticed the floors on the patio.... they were covered in soda/sticky stuff. Looking around I started seeing more this that were disappointing. The amount of birds and nests above eating areas was concerning. The bird droppings on the patio, fencing and exit doors was unacceptable. After putting in our order in it took 32 minutes for our food to come out. The server came around for drink refills only once and it took an additional 10 minutes between the server clearing the dishes for us to get our check.

It's sad because I think the best chicken wings in Happy Valley are being served out of this little dive bar in Happy Valley.  The actual Chicken Wing is standard, large and crispy but where they really stand out is their home made sauce.  Apparently the owner has been offered thousands of dollars for the secret recipe (this isn't your typical Frank's and butter) and I can see why.  

No ones wings in taste like these, the sauce is sour but sweet and spicy with flecks of either cheese or garlic, I can't put my finger on it.  They have great fresh cut fries that are strongly seasoned as well as fish fry, burgers, etc.

They only take cash and wait times for food can get into the hour + range because of their small kitchen, but it is so worth it.

I knew it was going to be a nightmare as soon as we walked into the place if we wouldn't have had a gift card we would've turned around and left. As soon as we stepped in the door it smelled terrible like the carpets haven't been cleaned since the place opened. I asked if a booth was available and the two ditzy hostesses looked at eachother and barely shook their heads no towards one another. They then said we could sit on the patio but I didn't feel like doing that because it was about 45-50 degrees. They said we could sit at a high table but didn't walk us to the table. After finally finding a place to sit we waited for a good 10-15 minutes before anyone even acknowledged our presence, when our waitress (Anna) finally came over to us she said ""someone has waited on you right!?"" Once our food came to the table 20 minutes later my fries were ice cold and we had no silverware. My wife didn't get one refill on her drink I only got one and I got it when my first drink was still completely full. Our bill came to $25.85 which was good because my gift card was $25.00 when I handed he card over she says we couldn't give the debit card to cover the remaining .85, seems stupid to me, I'm pretty sure any other place in America would do it that way. But whatever, I gave her the card and she says ""oh I messed up because I was going so fast I rang up the full $25.00 so you still owe .85 if you have a dollar I will take it."" I give her a buck and never got the change, needless to say she got a $1.00 and that was too much. I won't be going back to any BWW this one and the service ruined it for me for life! This hell hole doesn't even deserve 1 star. When we left the restaurant I was scanning for a manager and naturally I didn't see one anywhere.

When you go thru the drive thru at any restuarant there is a possibility that you might receive the wrong order. No big deal right? Just go back and let them know so they can give you the right order. When I went back to let Tonya know that I must have innocently received the wrong order, she proceeds to scream at me. I told her that mistakes are possible and that no one is perfect. She argues with me for close to 5 minutes and then eventually gives in and remakes my order. She then tells me that I am taking time away from helping other customers. Well newsflash, if I received the correct order in the first place I'd have no reason to come back. After she replaced my order she refused to return my receipt to me. The receipt has valuable information about contacting the General Manager and District Manager with any complaints. She didn't want to give me my receipt back because she feared that I would inform her superiors about how she is treating their valuable loyal customers. I had to snatch the receipt from her hands. This upset her so she then proceeds to write my license plate number down as if I had done something wrong. Regardless to whether this order was remade or not, the receipt is still my property. I paid for a good/service and I am entitled to a receipt under Arizona state law. I will be contacting Wendy's corporate office and the franchise owner directly in writing. To be treated this way by a drive thru employee is unacceptable. To be treated this way by a Wendy's employee is despicable. I have never had a problem at any Wendy's location. This experience has absolutely blown my mind. I will not continue to support the Wendy's mission. There are loads of restaurants in the area.

There was 1 person in front of us when we ordered, and we got Yo mama(biscuits and gravy with an egg and potatoes) and a lil jay(a waffle, egg, and meat) and it came out to 35$$$ after drinks. Which was a lot but I thought it would be worth it. Just those took over 30 MINUTES! No other orders besides ours and the one in front of us came out. When we did finally get our food the biscuits were rock hard and both eggs were barely warm and extremely oily. I asked for a waffle as a replacement immediately after trying the biscuits and was told I would have it in 3 min. Another 10 min later it was still not ready and we had to catch our flight so I asked for some kind of compensation and they told me I could not have any kind of refund but I could have 2 containers of gummy bears.

As I have waited for flights at Sky Harbor, I noticed this spot before thinking with disgust who in their right mind would wolf down chicken and waffles before a flight? Apparently nobody around me in that food court since everybody else was eating salads and staring at the gluttony about to occur. Now here's a case where what you do in Phoenix may not stay in Phoenix since who knows what would come out of you after the ""Fasten Seat Belts"" light comes on.

So yes, I had a half-hour and a weak moment at the same time and decided to give it a try. What may have not been a great sign is that I had to cajole the server to come out of the kitchen to take my order. He seemed a touch perturbed as he was chatting with the cook. It gave me more time to decide to go full gonzo and order the $14.50 Lo-Lo's Hood Classic. It consisted of three pieces of Southern fried chicken on top of two full waffles in a weak styrofoam container (photo: http://bit.ly/2m6cUi9). Don't judge me.

I was hungry because they didn't serve lunch at my business meeting. It was a huge amount of food as the people around me can attest, but I was disappointed how bland and dry it was once you get over the finger-burning heat of the chicken. The waffles were rubbery and merely acted as a sponge for all the grease (photo: http://bit.ly/2mlCFfa). It was hardly worth the massive calorie intake, and I ended up eating only half of it. My biggest challenge afterward was keeping it down, especially when my plane hit turbulence. Not pretty.

I ordered a side of fries, and they were not stingy about it - plenty of fries to share with other people. We got the Lo-lo's Special with 3 pieces of chicken and 2 waffles. The chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I recommend dipping the chicken in the hot sauce that is provided. The waffles also taste so much better when you add on the butter and syrup. I love getting the Kool-Aid; the amount of sweetness is spot on. My favorite is the fruit punch.

I would have given this place 3 stars for great food and convenient location. However, the service was terrible. The server did a subpar job. She couldn't remember our order. When our order was ready, she was stressed out that we were asking for extra hot sauce. There was only 2 other people waiting in line - nothing to be flustered about. She finally gave us our food, but forgot to give us our Kool Aid. We immediately informed her of our missing drink. Instead of correcting her mistake, she made us wait for her to ring up two more customers before giving us our Kool Aid. We were just awkwardly waiting at the pickup counter. Seriously, it does not take long to fill up a drink and give it to the customer. Our food was cold by the time we could get to it. Very disappointed in the decision-making process of this worker. I took away one star for bad service."	4.0

So excited in fact that I walked out of the terminal knowing that I'd have to go back through security again to get back on my plane. The best thing I can say about this place was that the cashier was upbeat, helpful and friendly. Otherwise this could be the most overpriced chicken and waffles I've ever had in my life. I was pretty disappointed although the sweet tea was way better than anything else I'd expect to find in Phoenix.

When I ordered three boneless chicken tenders with a waffle they told me it was going to take 12 minutes to cook and it did. I was more than happy to wait and had plenty of time. I figured having paid $16 for the meal it was going to be darn good. Unfortunately that wasn't the case period

I I grabbed my meal walked 20 feet and sat down at a table to try it out. The waffle was soaking wet and not even close to being done. This is an epic fail for a place that advertises Chicken and Waffles. If you're going to pride yourself on a meal like this the waffle better be crispy and have flavor period this had neither. The chicken was very average but no better than something offered at chains like Raising Cane's for a quarter of the price. What was most disappointing was there was absolutely no flavor to the chicken tender at all. Sure, it was fairly juicy but if you didn't dip it in the ranch you might as well drink water because it was tasteless. I ate the chicken tenders just because I paid so much for him and left the waffle after trying it. 

Another thing to consider if you are going to charge us as much as you do please take into consideration that everyone has to use a fork and knife to eat the waffle. That means when you place the waffle on foil and you try to cut through it the foil breaks apart and embeds itself in the waffle. Unfortunately foil doesn't taste well.  Even a paper plate would be much better. Again what a disappointment."	4.0

This was my first and second time visiting the airport location. I had been waiting to see it open for almost a year. But I don't think I've ever been so let down by a restaurant.

First time (10/12/14, 1:05pm) : I had a 20+ minute wait, when I was originally told it would take 7-10 minutes to be ready. They forgot several items, the sweet tea wasn't great, the ""gravy""... I'm not even sure what it is/was, and the chicken was just okay.

Second time (10/14/14 7:50pm): I had a much more reasonable 8 minute wait, but I was told it would only take about 3 when I placed my order. The sweet tea was good this time, the chicken was better this time but certainly not great, the gravy I won't be trying again (pretty sure it's from a can) and the waffle was bland and hard (either it had been sitting around or was over cooked)

The counter clerk came out and called for another name repeatedly but it wasn't mine. I drank my drink and read FB and waited some more.

I walked up to the counter and asked if my food was ever going to be ready and the clerk told me it had been ready and why hadn't I come and gotten it.

My brother and I visiting my father. Due to kemo my father hasn't been out to dinner for months. Tonight he found the strength to join us on our last night here, potentially our last meal out with our father.

No one at this property knew if any of this but it should not matter. 

The host that sat us was Madison. Madison sat us at the furthest table even passing 4 empty tables. Dad was a bit slow but really tried to move fast in his walker. Madison arrived at the table prior to us and had to wait for us with the menus. The table we sat at was wet with remains food prices remaining from the previous diners. Dad pulled out his handkerchief to dry the table as Madison is trying to put a menu in his hand. I told her the table was wet and still dirty. She apologized and continued to place menus in front of us. I lifted my menu up and gave it back to her and asked her for a towel.  She returned about 2-3 minutes later with a stack of napkins in which she handed to me to wipe and dry the entire table. Once I was done she literally threw four menus with all the inserts in the table and walked away. 

Really Madison??  Why she wouldn't dry the table and recipe it down is my question and then to lose patience this way was amazing. The guests first contact was Madison.   We never did get the inserts straight so not all of us saw the entire menu. 

The food was good everyone enjoyed the food. The service to receive drinks and the food was very much below average. After dinner we enjoyed nice conversation with our empty plates in front of us. They were never cleared off. 

Lack of training and/ supervisory at this property and the corporate office really needs to see how negative this property is to the chilis brand name

Stacked bar stools and the smell of cleaner at 8pm is never enticing or inviting to the customer (no matter how slow you are).  Management should make it clear that no ""closing duties"" happen in front of customers.. There are people eating in here and it's not a good feeling to be a part of ""clean up"" (nor appetizing).... Bad training X 10000,  this is how bars/restaurants go out of business... This is a classic local watering hole mistake,  a corporation like chili's should know better.  Really disappointing"	1.0

Arrived 5 minutes earlier than the estimated order completion time. I parked in the Chili's togo spot and waited.   And waited.  I finally got out of my car and went into the togo door where my food was waiting for me.   The waitress politely explained that I was supposed to phone them when I got there. Oh well no biggy as long as the food is good right?  YECH.  My Nachos laid flat and soggy in the bottom of the togo container.  My mothers sour cream chicken enchaladas were also uninspired and had a ""funky"" taste to them.  The smell inside Chili's smelled like a dumpster about to get real nasty in the Arizona sun.

However I do not know if it is this particular restaurant or if it is a corporate issue, but I could have gone to McDonald's or Burger King and gotten a better salad then what I got tonight. I did not even know any place still made salads that were all iceberg lettuce. To their defense the four pieces of spinach that they placed in the salad I guess should've been enough to classify it as mixed greens.

My husband got the cheese enchiladas which the sauce was horrible it was way over  seasoned with chili powder and probably cumin, almost a dark black color. We live in the state of Arizona we do know what enchilada sauce, red sauce is supposed to look like and this was not it. 

We did not complain to the manager because it probably would've been no good. Our server was OK not very attentive as he would had been on shift since 9 AM this morning and admitted that he was fried

We ordered the 2 for 22 and one cheese burger meal. For are appetizers we got the flower tortilla chips with guacamole and salsa the chips left a bad after tast like they were frayed in old oil. Then we got are meals I had the beacon burger and the waiter didn't even ask how I wanted it cooked so it was well done hard like a hockey puck. It came with fries the were cooked in same oil. The wife order the chicken crispers fried in same oil AGAIN after taste. She also got corn on the cob not bad. Her meal came with the same horrible fries. My mother in law ordered a cheese burger over cooked andvwaiter did not ask how she wanted her burger cooked came well done. She also got the fries. We asked for manger and he said he would take off the fried food off the bill since we did not eat it and offered us free desert. Well come TOO it he charge us for one and gave us two then when we got the bill it was still 30.00 and I still have that taste in my mouth shame on you guys should have comped the meal and told us TOO come back TOO try the place AGAIN.

There were more television screens and the staff seemed ""overly happy"" to have a good time.  I'm assuming this is because they're trying to more ""BAR"" than ""family restaurant.  

Though the attentiveness and the food arrived at a decent time, we noticed a difference in how the entrees were plated.  We decided to order 2 for 20 menu.  For the appetizer, we chose the Chips and Salsa.  The salsa had spilled all over the plastic bowl and the chiphs were so thing that it was like eating rice paper!  They were also doubled over in salt.  We had to literally shake some off.   The entrees arrived and we were a bit shocked.  My husband ordered a pasta and chicken dish.  There was more sauce and pasta and the smallest piece of chicken.  I had ordered the ""Famous"" Babyback ribs and wedges (which they were out of, so they substituted fries).  This was fairly unacceptable.  I was served on a salad plate.  Didn't resemble a entree, but an afterthought or ""extra"" serving plate, when you order the entree..  There wasn't barely meat on the bones and the sauce barely covered the 1/2 rack.  It seemed like they were sacrificing quality and quantity of food to pay for the new flat screens everywhere.  

If they are going to cater to an adult crowd, they there needs to be a strict policy whereas no children are allowed in the bar area--drinking or not.  We have nothing against children, but they need to remain in the family area-- especially if there is a chance for  people to order alcohol.  Now, this is just an opinion, when on a date night or date lunch or something for the couple, its the goal to have it be some adult time, not time to take care of or appease other peoples children.  (This goes the same for cruises~ even more so... Some are looking for a vacation to remember and rekindle--only distracts from the purpose why were there.  Again, I have absolutely nothing against children, but I do feel like parents need to exercise some judgement about where and when to family time is different than couple times."	0.0

She grabbed the manager  and his response was we will discount your order and remake it really just a discount it's been now over hour we've been there and just a discount, and then I pointed out that the table that sat after us received their food way before us and their response was they only had 2 food orders and I said excuse me that shouldn't matter and we had only 3 food orders. Oh have I mentioned we had our 2 year old grand daughter with us and she was done waiting.

When we arrived, it was before 6:00PM and we were seated right away because there were about 1/2 dozen tables seated in the dining room.  Our server came over and took our drink order and we also ordered an appetizer of the Skillet Queso.  She brought our drinks and asked if we were ready to order.  It was a new menu and we had an appetizer coming, so I wasn't in a hurry.  She checked on us a couple of times and we were finally ready after about 10 minutes.  We placed our dinner orders and waited.  Other tables were being seated and our server was busy.  After another 10 minutes our server was still busy delivering drinks and chips to other tables and then she disappeared.  I called over to our table a young man who had been walking around with a television remote and asked if he could check on our Queso.  He disappeared and after about 5 more minutes, our server came back with drink refills.  I asked her if she would cancel our appetizer because our meals should be coming out very soon.  She said OK and went into the back.  Then the young man came out with a skillet that was half full of Queso and we informed him that because it took so long, we had cancelled it.  He apologized and took it back to the kitchen.  20 minutes later, our meals arrived.  My meal was warm, my wife's was OK and my sons was blistering hot.  The server checked on us and I asked why everything had taken so long.  She said that she didn't know and offered to have the manager come to the table.  I said that would be nice.  The same ""young man"" who had been walking around with the television remote (and ignoring customers) came to our table.  He said that he is ""one of the managers"" and that he is new to this location.  While we were waiting, I had looked up the Yelp! reviews on this location.  I asked him if he had seen them and he said that he did not.  I told him how I had received bad service 8 months ago and it took me this long to come back.  I told him that based on my previous visit and this one, we would never come back.  He apologized but did not offer any explanation on why it took so long (to maybe let us know that our experience was unusual) or any invitation to try again.

I didn't want or expect anything for free, just an attempt to get us to try them again.  An offer to come back, ask for him and he would make sure that we had a good experience would have been enough to get us to come back.  Nope.  He was complacent to accept our complaint and move on.

Finally after moving slowly drinks arrived. Ordered food..wife had salmon and I ordered chicken crispers. Food comes out but waitress tells me the fries are still cooking. Since i prefer all of my food together at one time, I waited for fries before I would eat.  I didn't want my wife to wait because didn't want her eating cold fish. While waiting on fries, waitress walked by me at least 5 times and other peoples orders were coming out with fries. I flag down waitress and she acted surprised when I told her I am still waiting...like they should have  magically appeared on my table without her bringing them to me. She goes back to kitchen. Finally after to continue waiting the fries come out. i told the waitress this was unacceptable since my wife was 90% done with her meal and my chicken and broccoli were cold ans I wanted to speak to the manager.
Manager comes out and asks me what the problem is like he didn't already know. I explained my unhappiness with the service. He asks if comping my meal would be acceptable. I told him yes. My meal was $10.29 but when I got the bill he only comped me $6.61. I can't tell you how pissed I was that he lied to me after my dinner was pretty much ruined.
I would typically leave at least an $8 tip which was more than 20% but since I blame the waitress and the manager both i left a $3 tip.

Well when the food came I noticed that my chicken looked a little weird. As I cut into the chicken it didn't cut like normal chicken. I took a bit & it tasted spongy; the texture and taste were really gross. So I asked my husband about his chicken & he said it was also weird. Needless to say we both could not eat it. Now we have been to this chilies before & we always get some kind of chicken dish and we have never had this problem. I asked the server if they changed their chicken & she said no. But something was definitely off. Here's my tip to you, if you go here do not get anything with chicken breast.

They were advertised as 'fall of the bone tender'. They weren't too bad. I would have cooked them a tad more, myself. The beer sauce is lackluster at best. I ordered a rib-eye steak that came with potatoes and broccoli. I ordered extra asparagus, as well. She came back in a bit to tell me they were out of asparagus. My waitress brought out what turned out to be a sirloin steak. It had sharp edges, as if it had been cut from a larger piece of meat. I thought, OK, well I'll try it. The taste was not that of a rib-eye. Finally, when our young waitress came back, I questioned her as to whether it 'looked' like a rib-eye, because it sure didn't taste like one. She agreed that it looked like a sirloin, but she would check on it. Yes, it was a sirloin and would I like a rib-eye. So after that, the manager came over and saw the steak. He said he liked rib-eyes, too. It came out and it looked like a pork steak of all things, pale and no browning or grill marks at all. I ordered it med-rare and it was less than 1/2"" thick. I had never seen a rib-eye so thin, except at Waffle House, and there's wasn't too bad, compared to this one. The mashed potatoes were too gooey, as it they had been beaten for 15 minutes. They came with pepper jack cheese, which  had no flavor as this type of cheese should have. It is not written on the menu that they come with cheese of any type. When I questioned the waitress about the potatoes, trying to figure out if it would be worthwhile getting a new order without the cheese, she said they made them in a big batch. I told her I thought that from the menu they would be a little more potato chunks, smashed, more than mashed. Their menu needs more critiquing. My first bite of the end of the rib-eye was a tiny piece of rubber-like consistency. No way should a rib-eye steak of any thickness be 'rubbery'. The manager was too young looking to me. I would say that the cooks do not know what they are cooking and how foods should taste. We had originally wanted something that has been recently advertised on TV, but I didn't see anything that reminded me of the ad, so we ordered something we thought we would enjoy on a Sunday night. The waitress asked me if I would like something else. I said I came for dinner and a drink, so I guess I'll just have the drink. Big disappointment. We will NEVER darken their doors again.There was really no attempt to make anything right, other than replace one steak for the correct cut of beef. Maybe being close to the mall gives them a feeling that they don't have to try to please the customer with a great product."	0.0

This location used to be my family's favorite, my Grandmother used to love the salmon so much she used to have us pick it up from take out every Friday. Lately, though, the food has been going downhill badly. We've not ordered from them for a couple of months, hoping things would improve, but they haven't.
Tonight, I tried to order chicken crispers online, but was then given a notice that this location no longer serves  them. Fine, I ordered the Cajun Chicken Pasta, asking that there be NO spice, extra tomatoes, and extra Alfredo sauce. My sister ordered a chicken salad,  my mother ordered the salmon with a side salad, and my Grandmother ordered the salmon with broccoli and rice.
Only my Grandmother's order was correct. 
My mother's salad was nothing but weedy looking lettuce on top of a sprinkle of cheese - what the heck is that? Where were the tomatoes? It was a weird inedible joke. 
For my pasta, they apparently not only ignored my no-spice request, but they both cooked the pitiful and grisly chicken in it, and then dumped it in great chunks all over everything. Good thing I asked for extra Alfredo, because I had to wash it off. This is the third time they've messed up that spice. Perhaps the website should say this location can't not put the spice on.
The worst, though, was my sister's salad. Apparently the Cajun spice had really gone overboard, because they also cooked her chicken in it, and also covered her plain chicken salad in it. It was absolutely disgusting.
Also, when I went in to pick up the food, I could see right in to their kitchen. Funny, I wasn't allowed to order them, but before my eyes, I watched them make up two plates of chicken crispers.

Airports are not all notorious for their gourmet, reasonably priced restaurants, but this place made me feel taken advantage of.  

As the only place to grab a drink while waiting an hour and a half to board my flight I excitedly headed toward Jackalope Flats.  It's walls are peppered with vintage household items and of course that adorable little jackalope we all know and love.  

The menu is pretty basic, chili, salads, nachos, burgers and sandwiches.  I ordered the Turkey Club - Sliced Turkey, Swiss Cheese, Crispy Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Spicy Chipotle Honey Mayo on Sourdough Bread - sounds good!

WRONG!

The meat is the worst quality, water pressed ""turkey"" and the cheese was Swiss American ( a couple sparse holes and little flavor ).  The mayo tasted more sweet than spicy and the bread was so hard it cut the roof of my mouth.  I couldn't even eat the sandwich, it was so horrible.  

I guess the beer is the only good thing here because I ordered a mimosa that my server recommended to me.  The champagne was flat and warm.  When I asked the bar if they could remake it since it was flat and showed them the absence of all bubbles he offered to pour some soda water in it to add some ""fizz"".  

Honestly, this place isn't worth the money I'm spending.  If this places wasn't in the airport, there is zero chance it would survive."	1.0
769	4r0Ho5rbAZ_BhXvpQmxbag	0.0	0.0	1.0	"After our awful service at Jackalope Flats , I went to other websites to see if I was the only one that felt this way. I think Trip Advisor placed the ranking at 1073 out of 1083 for that type of restaurant. If I was the owner/manager I would be addressing all reviews good or bad. Obviously the passion stopped at the investment for these owners otherwise after all the bad reviews, something would change.

In airports, I agree they can be overpriced, blah. They don't have to be boring and lackluster. I do not mind paying for quality food and service, Chilis and TGIF all do a pretty consistent job. People that frequent airports come from all walks of life and from all over the world and have different opinions and you cannot please everyone. But one thing that should never suffer no matter where the restaurant or business is, CUSTOMER SERVICE.

We went to Jackalope Flats because the airport FAILS to tell you that once you go through security at Terminal 3, you have no choice but to eat here unless you want candy and soda at the News Stand. We went there on 09/02/13 and grabbed our own menus and sat down after standing there waiting a few minutes. We were finally greeted by a waiter (I do not remember his name and do not have the  receipt handy but he was the bald one)

We ordered our drinks and when he came back we placed a order of nachos as an appetizer first while we looked through the menu. almost 20 minutes went by and the waiter stops by our table and asked ""what did you order? He had forgotten to put our order in. No sorry! Our drinks were empty by then. Another 15 minutes went by and my boyfriend went up to the bar where he was standing and asked ""do we need to eat inside to get service"". I mean how long does it take to throw some chili and cheese on the nachos and heat up?

He finally brought our nachos and said ""Sorry, it was partly my fault, I forgot to put the order in"" Partly? Its all your fault. Most people are trying to grab a quick bite to eat between flights. If we were on a time crunch , we would have been screwed. Once again our tea and soda sat there empty. Didn't ask us how are nachos were.

Grabbed him to place our food order being it took 35 minutes to get appetizer. ordered turkey club, that  arrived quickly, served by another waitress who seemed VERY attentive to her stations. Waiter came around to refill our drinks but never asked how the sandwich was. Had to flag him down to bring check. Then we sat there another 10 minutes when our credit card was very visible. This place was dead, no reason for lack of service or slow. 

He picked it up, didn't say sorry for anything about our service or thank us. When he brought it back all he said was ""here you go"". It was the first time we ever did not leave a tip. Our tip to him was that we didn't ask to talk to his boss. Never felt so unappreciated at a business."	0.0

783	BHAIidO5o16UpCNY3qTICw	0.0	2.0	1.0	"Let me preface this by saying I actually felt compelled to make a Yelp account just to prevent other people from suffering the inexplicable ineptitude of the particular staff I dealt with during my visit to this location. My regular store is on 19th Ave. & Indian; they have never done me wrong, and I will never again go astray. Let me also just say that I have worked in pizza (in a real, from-raw-materials pizza kitchen), so I am not fooled. I know how pizza works, and my standards are the product of that experience.

During the dinner service on Saturday, August 29th, I visited the 43rd Ave. & McDowell location with three friends. I placed the following order for dine-in, and paused between requests to allow the crew member to input my orders: ""I would like three large pizzas. The first will be the Giddy Up BBQ Chicken with a stuffed crust. The second will be the Pretzel Piggy on a pan pizza crust, but the order is for a vegetarian, so please make sure no bacon is added. She would also like to switch the standard Balsamic drizzle for a barbecue drizzle instead. The third will be the Garden Party, extra sauce and no cheese, please."" The crew member read back my order, to the letter, and I went to our table to wait.

It goes promptly downhill from here.

First Incident: A server comes to the table with my friend's separate chicken wing order and drops her fork. She kindly offers to replace it, but when she does, she leaves the dropped fork in the middle of the dining floor. I'm sorry, why?

Second Incident: A second server come to the table to tell us two of the pizzas are ready to come out, but the third (my Garden Party) is being remade because cheese was added by mistake. Because I know that ""no cheese"" is a curveball request, this doesn't bother me too much, but now they have to trash a whole pizza, and that sucks.

Third Incident: My pizza arrives and, to my severe disappointment, I realize it is completely wrong. I hate being the complainer, but it's wrong enough that I need to address it. I approach the counter and explain to the same crew member who took my order that my pizza is incorrect. She says, ""Yeah, you ordered the Garden, it has no meat."" Perplexed by this response because it is wrong on so many levels, I say, ""I realize what a Garden pizza is. I ordered the Garden Party, extra sauce, no cheese."" To be clear, the Garden Party is defined as a Garden (Veggie) pizza to which three things have been added: a crust flavor edge, fresh spinach, and a Balsamic drizzle, all of which are what makes this a $15.49 item. I go on to say, ""The pizza on my table lacks the crust edge I paid for, the spinach I paid for, and the drizzle I paid for. Thus, it is not correct."" The crew member seems confused by my complaint and says, ""Do you want us to add the stuff to it?"" As calmly as I can through my annoyance because, no, you can't just add a new crust edge, I say, ""Yeah, I suppose you can.""

Not a moment later, I realize this process is not worth it, and I flag down the manager to request a refund. The manager, Daniel, was very polite and showed the appropriate level of remorse while making sense of my issues and processing my $17 refund, for which I was grateful. He also offered me a store credit, but because it would be specific to that location, I declined.

Fourth Incident: I return to my table and realize they've brought out my ""corrected"" pizza regardless, which I decide to consider a small victory at this point. One bite in, however, I find that they have managed -- once again! -- to drop the ball. The featured sauce drizzle for the Garden Party is the Balsamic. They used barbecue. I take a deep breath, process my First World Problems, and move on.

Fifth and Final Straw: As I eat my pizza with no more enjoyment left to spare for the meal, I am tasked with experiencing one final aneurysm. Now, when I placed the order for our table, I specifically requested two separate pizzas that have no meat on them. I even specified that one of us is vegetarian (I felt no need to mention it, as my pizza was inherently vegetarian, but I also do not eat meat), so I thought it would be logical to assume that the staff would take extra care to ensure no meat made it onto the pizzas by mistake. Apparently this was far too lofty an expectation, because I plucked a chunk of bacon fat the size of a dime off of one of my slices.

At this point, so baffled I was nearly crippled by the sort of laughter one only experiences when sanity dies, I resolved never to return to this circle of Hades cleverly disguised as a Pizza Hut.

Its gonna be a 2 1/2 hour wait I was like its already 10 p.m..  told her it was to late and my husband stuck the pizza in the over on warm to heat up. nothing else offered or no apology the delivery driver was even surprise by her response and was more sincere with his apology.

2) Update and maintain pre-prepared food selection. Random salads and curry and rice are inadequate, they get old, and folks don't want them.
3) I've been there with huge lines where you have one person both taking orders and making coffee and another filling the case with muffins or making sandwiches for cases (not for orders). Do that stuff before you open. Streamline service so it's faster. I've walked out a ton of times because it takes too long. The lines mean you get the business. But they also mean people will bail on you if a better option is just outside.
4) Improve your coffee and iced coffee."	2.0

I ordered the Chicken Garden Salad, this was a sad salad. I know I should have set it back but I didn't. I didn't because there was nothing else on the menu healthy ( as close to healthy as you can get). The lettuce was wilted and not enough, chicken was good, not enough filling.

Once it got to the table I noticed that it had been sitting a while as the drink was now overflowing over the glass due to the ice melting.

The bar is seat yourself so we sat and waited and waited for someone to come wipe off our table (it was the only one available) and bring us menus. Not a huge deal since they were super busy. 

Our server (who will go unnamed) greeted herself and took our drink orders. I ordered a long-island iced tea since they were on special and I haven't had one in forever. It was HORRIBLE, I have had many Long-Islands in my day and this by far was the worst. It was orange, I think they filled the glass half way with sour mix, added some well liquor even though it was supposed to be top-shelf and forgot the splash of coke. Problem is she brought the drink when she took our food order so I didn't get a chance to drink it until she walked away. Normally, I won't say anything, I'll just down the drink and order something else next time. This was so bad and so sour I couldn't even get it down. 

Finally I flagged her down and ordered something else, when I told her I would like to get something else because...well i couldn't finish my sentence because her ADHD took over and away she went. I sat there with my mouth opened wondering if I was even talking out loud (my bf assured me I was). She left the drink on the table so I really wasn't certain she heard me. 

Then the food came. I had ordered a create-your-own chicken sandwich with a side salad instead of fries. The sandwich came out exactly as I had ordered. However, I had the wrong dressing for my salad and we had no silverware. She dropped off the food, never asked if we wanted anything else and just took off, I tried stopping her but that was a lost cause. 

I sat there looking around, trying to make eye-contact with anyone who was glancing my way. Our server was just standing by the bar chit-chatting. Finally someone walked by and I asked if we could get silverware and ketchup, I had high-hopes she would bring me a fork, but she didn't. So there I sit some more, unable to eat my salad. Finally a manager walked by and I asked him, instead of him grabbing it, he shouted for someone else to do it. YAY, I got a fork. Too bad the dressing was wrong (and not tasty) and no server to ask to correct it. Finally when I'm putting my last bite in my mouth she came over and asked how we're doing. Really? You're going to ask me now? UGH.

I saw someone nearby who had ordered a large portion of wings who got there after us and they received their wings before us. Now there could very well of been a reason for this but the server should have said there was a problem and we would have just left rather than wait for the food.

After I received my bill I let her know I ordered a snack and not a small. She grabbed my plate without asking and pointed out that I received a small. I again, told her that I ordered a snack and she said that's why I read the order back to you. I told her I am such a loyal customer, I come here at least once a week and I always order a snack. She cut me off and said okay so you want me to take it off, and I said yes. She stormed off and when she came back she said, do you still want these to go, I said yes, and she slammed the ticket on the table. She walked away and started arguing with her co- worker right in front of our table as if I didn't know she was talking about our table. I am not looking for anything out of this just a place where I can go to enjoy some amazing wings. I am such a loyal customer, please look me up!!!

Upon my arrival I spoke with a server on the patio and asked about coming in through the gate so that I would not have to bring my dog through the restaurant. I have been to a number of bwws and have never had an issue with my dog on their patio. The server told me it was fine to bring her through the restaurant so I carried my small dog through as I did not want to be rude.
I ordered the Greek salad with chicken, which is what I regularly order. The hummus was literally inedible and the pita bread almost raw. The salad had multiple stalks from the bottom of the lettuce in it, which I don't know about you but I would not serve a salad like that to guests in my house let alone at a restaurant.
While I was disappointed with the food I chalked it up to ""well it's a chain, probably shouldn't have high expectations."" Then half way through our meal a manager came out and requested that I show him papers proving that my dog is a service dog. I did not have my purse on me, but I was wearing my medical walking boot. I have never been asked if my dog was a service animal on a patio in Arizona. I was then told that since I could not produce papers I would have to tie my dog up outside the patio where there is no shade and where she would constantly come back through the gate since she could fit through the bars. Not to mention walking on my busted ankle hurts enough, but the gates on the patio have alarms so to get her out there I was going to have to walk all the way out and around and then back the same way. My friend and I decided we would just try to finish our meal quickly, as I said we had already been there at least 30 minutes, but the manager came back out again. This time he brought a large man with him. I do not appreciate the fact that he was trying to physically intimidate me. At this I told him to just bring us boxes. This was literally the most ridiculous experience I have ever had at any restaurant and I will definitely not be returning. Not worth it to be subjected to such disrespect and low quality food."	2.0

They need to learn to employ people who can handle pressure, because that's life in the restaurant business. She also didn't seem to even understand what I was saying, so either she was thickheaded or not listening. I'm personally in the industry, and the way she handled it was so ridiculously unprofessional.

We expected the food to be pretty bad and that she would have little choice as she is a vegan but we were really only there for the company.  It didn't start out well when they were out of Cabernet, but no big deal.  We weren't expecting anything that would be reviewed in Wine Spectator.  The only things on the menu that she would consider eating was the french fries until she learned they were fried in the same oil as the chicken and bacon.  The server offered to have the chicken left off of a salad for her and that is what she ordered.  As he took orders from the rest of the table he was conscientious to point out that anything other than standard menu items would be an extra charge.

After we ate some rather dreadful stuff and an incredibly banal salad we received the bill and I paid.  As we were getting ready to leave the thought occurred to me that if they charge  for some extra peppers they should probably have given us a discount for leaving off the chicken.  I checked my ticket and discovered we had paid full price of $11.95 for what was effectively a side salad with three olives which made it Mediterranean.  I asked the server about this and he agreed we should not have to pay full price and went to talk to the manager.   When he came back he informed me that the menu was as-is and there would be no discount.

There were six pieces of chicken about the size of a dime and not much thicker!  Seriously!  I'm glad they only gave me about a cup of lettuce, because much more and I would have puked!  The preservatives on the lettuce was strong, so you know it had to be older than dirt to have it brown and wilted. All of this enjoyment for $8.49.  Came withe a cup of soup.

E.G.,  No sauce/wrong sauce. It's been on time,  but returning to get them fixed  x2 in 2 orders. nah.  

My biggest cause of star loss is that BWW changed the policies in store on wing sizes, they used to say, ( at least 5,  at least 10, etc but no longer on the online order. For at least a week after this change, the online order wasn't updated and claimed a number/ price that you didn't get when you turned up in store.  For us, a wing here or there is minor but in all their stores that adds up.  I sent them a message through their contact form, got the usual we're looking at it, then nothing, I pinged them a couple of times via Twitter/ Facebook..still nothing.

Tons of TVs so you can watch a wide variety of televised sports. At least they have that going for them.

According to the name of the restaurant, wings should be the specialty and by the looks of the menu, you would think that they are. Wide variety of sauce or rub options - classic or boneless.

Around 30 minutes later, we realized it was already 6:15 and we had spent an hour still waiting for our appetizer. We finally flagged down another waiter and asked him to check on our food and see if he could locate our waitress who was no where to be found. Around 10 minutes later she came back with our food, which was lukewarm. We think she forgot about us and let our food sit out for a long time before she came back. She didn't apologize or make any attempt to fix the situation, though she knew we were upset. Maybe MELANIE should go back to training for a bit, spend some one-on-one time with a manager.

Where I had serious issues was when a customer sat next to my friend and me. He professed to be a gang member, then tried to start a fight with my friend. My friend and I had no desire to fight anyone, and I thought the appropriate measure would be to inform management of what was going on so they could remove the individual starting a fight in their establishment. However, the guy starting the fight was a regular customer, and management decided he could stay because he said he would stop. I was beside myself. This guy had threatened to assault my friend and was allowed to stay. I wasn't okay with continuing to sit next to this guy. I told them that they need to ask him to leave. As they refused, I became irate and berated the manager for allowing this to happen. Because I was speaking loudly, we were asked to leave instead. This was over a month ago, and I'm still livid about the situation. The bottom line is that if one attends this establishment regularly, it's okay to threaten other customers. If you speak out about being threatened, you'll get thrown out.	0.0

Once we were finally seat our waiter tells us that the drinks are bottomless but did a poor job on bringing refills asked for. To top it off I ordered some kind of ranch grilled chicken burger. When I bite into it the ""grilled"" chicken tasted raw and uncooked almost, it was very hard to chew . Honestly the best part about my meal was the potato wedges and dipping sauce that came with the my burger and also watching the game with some pals of mine.

Left my keys here last night, so this morning after realizing they weren't at my place I called them. My first call was short, I was told my probable wasn't important enough and that I need to call back in 10 minutes. So I did, new person answered, I was put on hold for 5 minutes then someone picked up and asked if I would like to place an order...I said no I'm trying to find my keys, instantly put on hold again. 5 minutes later I hung up because I already was on my way in a friend's cars. I walk in to an empty restaurant (clearly I didn't need to be put on hold for extensive periods of time) and I was obviously frustrated. I approach a few workers and said hi since calling didn't get me answers I'm here to see if you guys found my keys. She asked me to describe them and the second I did she started to walk away to grab them. I expressed that I was confused as to why that couldn't have happened over the phone. And she made rude remarks under her breath as she walked away.

Came in and sat in the bar on the dividing line booth.  Waitress and Captain came up and welcomed me, I ordered a beer and was going to catch up on news from the day on the phone.  Next time that I am contacted, it was for ""Happy Hour is ending, can I get you anything before it does"" and I still hadn't received my first beer.  News flash restaurants:  If you see a single party, you need to make sure that this party is visited more than 20 minutes apart.  I have no one to talk to, I usually eat out alone/and or I'm traveling.

Beer was brought, then I was asked if I wanted another before the ""Happy Hour"" pricing is over.  Suddenly, the other beer appears and I have to chug this one so the other beer doesn't get warm.  (shock to those who know me, but I was already pissed at this point). 

Then I ordered food, since it's ""Boneless Thursday"".  Food order takes about 30 minutes, although it was fresh and the quality is good.. but really?  30 minutes for boneless wings, some carrots and celery and blue cheese dressing?

All is good until I go to close out the tab.  One beer out of three is comped, but the climax to the visit?  The pen that I received from the waitress doesn't write or is out of ink.  I then have to flag someone else down to get a pen that writes.

I'm thinking that BWW is not wanting my business, and since I contacted corporate and didn't get any satisfaction in Albuquerque, this would be the same thing.  I'm tired of people not wanting to wait/serve me, be it a bartender or a wait person.

I did have a good visit in Surprise a week ago, but I don't want to drive to Surprise every time that I want to visit BWW.

Buffalo Wild Wings used to be the place to go when you wanted to go to a sports bar with good food.  But alas, just as in the other comments on this location, it would behoove me to go to the Hooters across the parking lot because the service is 5 times better than here."	3.0

We sat down at a half booth half table in the bar next to a large party and were greeted by a young man named Aaron.  He immediately told us the table was reserved as the party next to us had more people coming...thats funny I didn't know you could reserve tables in a bar during HH.  So here I am 9 months pregnant told to get up and move to an uncomfortable high top.  My husband mentions that if a table is reserved it should have signs on it so people don't sit down and have to move.  Instead of saying Im sorry or I'll let a manager know Aaron decides to get snappy and tell us we should just get there earlier next time. Thanks Aaron, we'll keep that in mind when we go anywhere but this Buffalo Wild Wings location.  As we got up to leave he sarcastically said goodbye and proceeded to be argumentative with my husband when he told him that his customer service skills were seriously lacking.

Didn't get our ranch until 15 minutes later but by then we were already tired of waiting and pretty much done eating. Obviously every single one of our wings isn't going to be perfect and it's normal for them to have some dark spots, it's completely understandable... Tonight, there was one that was extremely dark all around and didn't look appealing in any way. I was afraid to eat it and just by looking at it you knew that it had to go straight in the trash!

The service is poor, upon arriving there was a wait, so the girl asked if we wanted inside or outside I asked what the waits were for each and she said 10 for inside and about 20 for outside.  I put us down for inside so it would come up quicker, then several people came up behind us and were seated before us, on the patio.  Weird.  So we are seated and we order  beers and appetizers (garlic mushrooms) and the mushrooms came before the beer.  And they were tiny.  I tasted no mushrooms in the breading, and I've had them before and they haven't been like that.  By the time I got my beer I was so thirsty I drank it all before my wings came.  Then my mango habenero wings came, and no beer.  So while waiting for my next beer my songs got cold.  Bad experience, bad meal, if we do ever go back to a BWW it won't be this one.	1.0

The food and service is pretty much pretty good, and the Captains are in general friendly, with the exception for Becca she's a mouthy jerk.
Me personally BWW having Captains is a joke, all they really do is interrupt the customers socializing and does nothing they promise. 
We've been going to this BWW since they opened, but the past 2-3 months a few of the Captains crank the music so loud that we have had to put ear plugs in.
Yesterday once again when we showed up about 4:45 pm there was about 10 customers in the place. The music was rocking stupid loud Becca mentioned she's the (joke) Captain and she's there to make our stay pleasant.
I asked her to please turn down the music, she replied she'll think about it but never did. When our server showed up I asked him to please turn down the music in the dinning area, he did. But after about 30 minutes of pleasant dinning, Becca decided to be a jerk again and cranked the music even louder than it was before.
We quickly finished our drinks and left about one hour earlier than we normally do.
We dine out 7 days a week at a different establishment, NEVER  none of the other places is this rude with loud music. A few of the employees at BWW Metro have absolutey NO respect for the customers and do what they want.
We've been there when they crank up the music so loud that young children start crying making it misurable for other customers. 
If it wasn't for the ignorance with the excessive loud music in a so called sports bar and the few jerk employees we have had to deal with, I would have given more stars.
But after our experience last night compliments from a mouthy jerk Becca ruining our evening with excessively loud music 2 stars was actually to many. 
A few of these ignorant young people at BWW just doesn't seem to comprehend if you loose customers you won't make money.
We survived many years without BWW Metro, and I'm pretty sure we'll do just fine at Native, Hooters, Chill's, Fajitas just to name a few in this area that we go to where we don't have to deal with ignorance with stupid loud music and ignorant captains.
I did talk to Peter today (the big manager over several BWW) he appears to be ok with the loud music, we're not.
IMO can the Captains idea and put them to work as servers actually taking care of the customers. The Captains do NOTHING when it comes to serving the customers with food and drink when the servers are not available.

I asked about the Beefy Burger (soooo totally named wrong) and whether or not it was made with the ""slider"" sized patties and she said ""Oh no, its the big patties. It's a huge burger""! With that being said, I ordered it. SLIDER sized patties and the ""Shaved prime rib"" was non existent. I have had better burgers for half the price (the BEEFY Burger was $11)

Came in tonight for food and games. It took a waitress 10 minutes to come to our table to get our drink order. Took her another 10 minutes to bring the drinks and then another 10 to come back for our food order. After the food order went in I think we sat there for another 15 minutes for some kids mini sliders and a chicken and cheese quesadilla. The food wasn't great but I never expect it to be since it never has been, nor will it ever be. 
After we ate we waited about 30 minutes before I had my friend go find the manager and ask for our bill. It was explained to the manager that the service was poor and we never knew where our waitress was when we needed something. It was also explained how long we'd been waiting. He didn't care. Made no effort to rectify the situation.

I assumed it was a joke and said no way. He then began a defensive tirade, petulantly showing me how me how he makes a single shot look like a double shot. Matt just blew me away. I remained firm refusing to pay for it, so Matt huffed and puffed, and then ran to the manager, Bryan, to complain about us. Bryan then came over and said,""Do we have a prob-lem?"", just when I thought this couldn't get more Richard Simmons, I told him this situation was fallacious and that I simply did not want to be charged double for what was a single. When I explained to Bryan how Matt's behavior was getting out of hand, Bryan too began to huff and puff. Essentially, this all happened because I caught a bartender scamming his customers and the manager was in it. I dropped $150 on food and drinks which is probably why this happened. Matt also expected a tip, however, I told him he didn't do his job to my expectations. Nevertheless, after visiting this location hundreds of times since it was a Jillian's 15 years ago, my family and I were kicked out for contending illegal and dishonest behavior by a bartender."	0.0

She didn't even leave the bar that entire time to ask anyone. we went to sit down at a table thinking we would get better service than the careless employees at the bar. nope. 15 minutes and the server was too busy cleaning her tables to even tell us they weren't serving anymore. no one helped us. so we got up and left. I wasn't about to pay for a Dr. Pepper that the bartender went out of his way to mess with.

Decided to come again on 8-14-16, Dustin was our waiter, although he's a bartender.  Service was horrendous. Food was even worse. All of our 5 dishes came out separately, about 10-15 mins apart each dish so we were literally here for almost 2 hrs just eating.  My toddler got the kids pretzel dogs which were dripping in grease, i requested fruit instead of fries but Dustin said they don't have fruit. What type of restaurant doesn't serve fruit?! Don't you use fruit to make drinks also???? So Wtf? Then my husbands steak salad looked like hamburger meat, didnt even bother to take a bite to try it... So he asked for a salmon instead and the guy who bought us our food and the waiter talked about the the food being sent back for like 5 minutes... Like whats the big deal? So unprofessional.

The amount of food on the plates is absolutely TINY and VERY expensive. Not to mention the actual quality of the food is mediocre at best. Got the enchilada combo plate and there was a thin layer of food that barely rose above the lip of the flat plate. It was like eating food in 2D since there was no depth of sustenance. I think my printer could print out a thicker layer of ink than the thickness of food on the plate. Honestly, Taco Bell destroys this place in quality and amount of food given. The food is very simple and could be made for a couple dollars at home. No value whatsoever.

Service was meh. Large party? Forget about it as they can't deal with it. I was continually bumped in my shoulder by the servers as they retrieved and placed dishes and glasses.

They have a live mariachi band on some nights which was pretty cool but they don't play at some stage in the middle of the restaurant, they walk around and play RIGHT by your table VERY loudly which is extremely annoying while trying to eat or even talk with your party. 

Also, location? It's in a dive of a place with many rowdy bars nearby and just a single working light pole in a rather large parking lot. It's the kind of place you wonder if your car is going to get broken into."	1.0

Even after she was holding the silverware in her hand looking confused AND I pointed at the 3 other people that needed silverware the lady just walked away. We were a party of 12, the restaurant knew ahead of time we were coming and customized a menu for our table with only 3 choices: 1)cheese enchiladas 2) chicken tacos 3) bean tostadas. Even then they couldn't get it right. We all ordered together and our food came out 2 at a time and over a span of 2 1/2 hours. Our food arrived cold, the cheese was hard, the chicken bland and beans were cold. The place was empty so they had no excuse. There were only 2 small tables there and they had already been served when they were taking our order. Needless to say this place was a great disappointment and not worth a second visit. If you're in the area you are better off going any other place for Mexican food than here. May I recommend, Filibertos? At least their food is cheap and usually hot!	1.0

The salsa was alright too. Not bad. I ordered a beef tostada and a beef taco. I took one bite of the tostada and couldn't take another. So gross. The beans were nasty. Not the refried beans im used to. I could have bought a can of Rosarita and been better off. Also, Idk what it was but something on there was really mushy. Almost a fish consistency actually. I was grossed out. The taco was OKAY...but I had about two bites of that as well...I thought I was getting ground beef but it was shredded. I gave the plate back and they didn't charge me for it. I also tried the chicken in my boyfriends enchilada and that was disgusting as well. I wanted to spit it out but i just dealt with it. He didn't like anything on his plate but the chicken inside of the enchilada. Sauce was gross, etc. I'm not going to come back. Super friendly staff though!!

957	6MpRsUKPpGUXklU2bYHUDg	0.0	1.0	2.0	I'm comparing this Chili's to the one on Shea in Scottsdale.  This was a Sunday at about #:30-ish.  There was no wait although the room was packed.  Our server was quick, pleasant, and as a long time ago server myself, hit all the required steps with perfect timing and a smile.  I always stick to my favorite dish, the Triple Dipper.  I'm crazy about chicken crispers, so they were two of my choices, with the third being southwestern eggrolls.  I've had this at least 6 times before at other Chili's.  The bad news was one bite of the egg roll sent me into spasms of choking and coughing and left my throat burning.  Someone went to town with the cayenne pepper or hot peppers.  I tried it again at the end of the meal and it again set my mouth on fire.  There has always been a little kick to these but NEVER enough to choke me and burn afterward.  The chicken crispers were surprisingly disappointing.  They were not burned or dry, but were far from fresh.  All the other times I've had them there has been a loud crunch at the first bite of freshly cooked coating, then the juices surround my mouth with butter soft delectable chicken.  Even drowning them in the ranch dressing didn't help.  They were edible, but not noteworthy.  Probably what you would get from a pouch of frozen breaded chicken once it had been dipped in the deep fryer basket again to serve hot.  This is not the usual Chili's experience, so I can't blame the chain.  But I blame the manager for caring more about filling seats than the quality of the food.  I'll stick to my beloved Scottsdale Chili's on Shea where I've never been disappointed, even once.	1.0

On this visit we had screaming Mexican kids and one angry old man who became upset after I was listening to my conference call on speaker. It didn't end well for that guy as I put him in his place considering this Chili's is piping in music during your meal. As for the food, it was 8 bucks for a mini order of fajitas and a small salad for the starter. Nothing special with the salad and the fajitas were a mess of overcooked onions and peppers and below average chicken strips. They give you a few tortillas and sour cream and pico, but everything is kind of a half portion for lunch.

Restaurant was pretty dead when we arrived which left us wondering why the waitress was so unattentive .  It appeared  she chose to avoid us due to the fact that are  food  was taking forever. Manager comped my meal but it was a horrible dining  experience and I usually  like chili's won't be returning to this location. Your better off eating at a hot dog Stand!	0.0

I haven't received such poor service in a long time. My waitress had an assistant who did all of her work. We were ignored and never greeted or asked how we were doing.

We counted how many times the waitress and the assistant walked passed our table while we had dishes piling up and empty water glasses. 4 total before I flagged the HOSTESS down to retrieve our waitress so we could get the check. They forgot to bring out a side of one of the dishes, they didn't bring condiments when we politely asked. 

When the waitress did come over to abruptly fill our water glasses or to bring the late dish of mashed potatos it was never kind. We felt like we were being ignored and that we were annoying the waitress.


The three of us are early twenties. So we understand having waiters treat us differently because they assume we don't tip. Though this is the first time in all of my life I have left a $0 tip. If I like my service I'll provide above and beyond gratitude. 

I understand things get hectic in a restaraunt and the staff that night could have be understaffed. But that is no reason for the employees to not be polite to their customers. We would have been okay with an apology for slow service or a warning that things will be nuts. We didn't get that much respect. 

I would provide the name of my waitress. Though that would mean I actually got one. If I could provide less than 1/5 Stars I would. But I think the $0 tips from my roommates and I and the poor surveys we left on their ""anti-customer service monitors"" they leave on the table.

I will not be returning to this Chilis.

P.s. Food was amazing. Restaraunt was clean.

P.p.s. This was my first terrible experience at this specific restaurant. I have gone and ate at the bar before and have had great experience with their service. If you choose to done at this location avoid the section by the bathrooms that's where we got discarded."	2.0

Tried the smothered prime rib burrito, which is a new menu item.  The burrito was 80% rice, with a small amount of meat. The enchilada sauce on top was not good enough to save the day.  The wife got some kind of smoked chicken stuffed quesadilla.  It came with no salsa or hot sauce and was very bland.  Add two soft drinks and tip and this was over $30.  I could have done better at Taco Bell for less than  $10.  Now I  remember why it's been years since I've been to Chili's.	1.0

The girl answered and I ordered a: Guaqamole Burger with a Black Bean Patty (I don't eat meat) and NO Cheese or Sour Cream, but to ADD Tomato (this is important).

I get there and I pay, When I get the food I open the box to take a quick peak to make sure I didn't get some sort of Bacon Cheeseburger by mistake or something. 

When I do this the girl makes a comment and said ""are you making sure I got the order correct or something?"". 

I get all the way home and when I go to dive in to the burger I notice there's NO tomato. So I call back to let the girl know and she IMMIDIATELY went in to ""defense mode"". 

She says ""well I specifically asked them to put it on myself so it's on there"" and when I assured her there was NOT any tomato because I was LOOKING at the burger she says 

""well if you want to drive all the way back I guess I can give you an extra slice of tomato? I mean what do you want me to do?""

She then asked me if I wanted to speak with a manager, I said yes.

Put me on hold and finally the manager came on the line and when I explained to him the situation and what the girl said on the phone he says:

""well that's unacceptable, thanks for calling in have a nice night""

No resolve, No apology just quick to brush the issue aside. Forget about the tomatoes at this point it's the fact that My mother chose to get me a gift card to this specific establishment only for her money to go towards an experience like this.

I will never go back to this location because clearly not only do they make the mistake, and they DON'T make it right, you get attacked when you try to bring it to their attention.

The Restaurant was not very busy but there was a family seated behind us, well they asked to be moved over my loud voice, which is completely understandable.

I couldn't have fathomed being more angry when I left than when I had came in. 

How was food?  It was alright at best.

How was the service?  Slow as hell for how slow the restaurant was.

Did I leave a tip? Only because one of my party members is a server.

For starters, you should have more faith that your chef knows what medium-rare is.  Secondly, let me cut my steak when I'm ready.  I think they did that so they didn't have to come back to our table for a while, because our server disappeared after he declined to cut the steak the third time.  Of course when he finally did, it was medium-well.

How is it possible that an order that was out in the previous day is taking longer than a same day order? No apologies or explanation was offered either.

Had beers (yay) wings were ucky, chili was ucky, salad was passable. Service was slow, they have the table menus on the tablets. Which were fun to play with but you had to pay.

We ordered the ribeye steak and a cheeseburger.  On top of the food taking forever, the waitress was nowhere around to even ask what was going on.  She finally comes out, drops off the food and leaves. The steak was overcooked the potatoes were cold and we waited and waited for her to come back to check on us.  Well that never happened.

Keep in mind the restaurant was dead.  I finally ended up looking up a number on Google calling the restaurant and the manager actually answer the phone and I asked him if he can send the waitress over to our table to send back our steak.  

Mr manager pops over apologizes for the inconvenience ask me what I wanted to order.    I got a cheeseburger he leaves and we wait again.  While we're waiting we obviously completely pissed off the waitress because she dropped off drinks at our table and didn't even look at us.  

Mr manager brings the cheeseburger out and then he disappears too.  For whatever reason the cheeseburger had no mayonaise on it and was completely dry.  At this point you'd think the manager would circle back or maybe the waitress just to make sure things are okay. Well that didn't happen.

The food has been pretty much consistent throughout the years.  Unfortunately, this location must have been the worst Chili's experience ever.  The bartender and the guy working in the bar area were unfriendly and impersonable.  It was a busy night, I understand that.  But the energy at this restaurant was strange, almost unfriendly...uncaring.  As if the staff didn't like each other.  I'm not sure if you're trying to promote an unfriendly sports bar atmosphere that only caters to men with snooty servers, or if you just missed the target on what a friendly family restaurant should be.  Both bartender and waiter lacked enthusiasm and personality.  I noticed only one regular at the bar, if that.  I can understand why.  Generally, there are regulars all the time at other Chili's locations and their bartenders actually interact with their customers.  The other staff members know the customers as well.  The staff interact with each other and seem to enjoy working at Chili's.  No, not this place.  Not this bartender.  I guess his name was Cory, according to the receipt.  I wouldn't know for sure because he never actually said hi to me or introduced himself.  It took about 15 mins for the manager to bring out queso.  15 mins.  I wasn't drinking very fast, but I finished my first beer before I got the queso.  Odd.  Everything was so slow.  The another customer next to me also said the bartender was inattentive and he waited 30 mins for a refill of his soda.  I also noticed his food took awhile to come out.

Our server was Vincent. I liked Vincent. He came across as an old school server. He knew his stuff, was pleasant, stopped by our table when needed, was never intrusive and was on his game. Nice job. 
Now, I would like to point out that I don't put much star value on the service at any restaurant, maybe one star. Why? Because if I go someplace and have awesome food but crappy service I can always go back and ask for a different server. I'm there for the food. Yes, service IS part of the whole experience. But since there's 5 stars to hand out I'm not going to waste more than a star on a variable that I can change the next time I'm there. So, I'll step off my soapbox now.
When C ordered his usual Grilled Chicken off the kids menu, Vincent explained that they had a new kids menu and the grilled Chicken was no longer available. We checked out the ""New"" Kids menu and C decided on the Kids Grilled Dippers ($5.19). Basically Chicken strips, or the old grilled chicken but cut into strips. The chicken was a bit overdone which made it a tad dry. C got the usual side of Corn Kernels which this time they barely filled the ramekin half full.
No bueno.
K & I did the 2 for $20 deal. We both got Fajitas. Mine were all pork and K's were half pork half chicken. Both sizzling plates were not sizzling very much and honestly, they were both mostly a plate full of sautéed sliced green bell peppers and onions with a little pile of meat on top. Not a very good presentation and not worth the $10 each plate cost. They also stopped using the metal condiment tower that in the past came with the fajitas. 9 or so little metal ramekins filled with the condiments for your fajitas. Not no more. Now the sides are brought out with the tortillas in larger ramekins but there are fewer of them. Bummer.
Grandma C got the Crispy Crispers ($10.19) with fries. She said they were as good as they have been in the past, no complaints from her. Grandma C & K both got flavored tea ($2.69 ea.) and C got Strawberry Lemonade ($2.89).
Good server, overcooked chicken strips, lousy side portion of kernels, $20 for basically two plates of sautéed bell peppers & onions. 2 Stars."	6.0

I guarantee I will  never eat another bite of anything from a Chili's restaurant!!I had read about restaurants serving what is called Frankenstein steak. We got cubes of meat to rather than strips for our fajitas. The smell was awful!! One bite and it went straight in the garbage!!! I called the store manager and I did raise my voice and told her I was feeding the meat to my dog. I decided that it was not even fit for my dog to eat and tossed it in the garbage!! By the way the manager hung up on me. I called their corporate offices and advised them that the only description for what they are serving is sh**!!! She then said she was going to hang up on me!! I advised her our conversation was over and she says they serve nothing but quality food!! My last sentence to her was that I have already used the only word I know of to describe what Chili's is serving!!	0.0

The start of our experience was great, our server got and drinks and apps out in good time. After we placed our food order things went down hill fast. 
We had been waiting for our food for over an hour and the restaurant didn't have every single table full of people, we were actually surrounded by a bunch of empty tables. When we could finally track down our ever-absent waitress we asked her to cancel our food order and we just wanted to pay the remainder of our bill so that we could go somewhere else. Our request prompted the manager to come over and apologize. I told her we were out for our sister's birthday and wanted to have a good time but we were so disappointed in the wait and lack of service. She offered to take 50% off our bill and still bring us our food but we just wanted the bill so we could leave. I get the bill about 10-15 minutes later and all she took off was the food, no additional discount was on the bill. I was so fed up with the situation I didn't even care .

We knew it wouldn't be reasonably priced but what a sticker shock! $66.00 for three people and no appetizers!
The place has seen better days. Yes, it was noisy with the ""rain"" and the ""animals"". The fish tanks looked nice though.
I eat meatless and had the veggie burger with onion rings, my other half had a cheeseburger and fries, my daughter had ""rasta pasta"".
The Rasta she said had a funny oil film on it, and my daughter thought it was part of the sauce so she mixed it in. She said it tasted funny and kind of rancid.
My burger was ok but was a bit mushy. The cheeseburger was average.
It was all over priced but the bonus from it all is that we all got sick from our meal there! :( 
 I had a ""sour stomach"" (read between the lines) until this afternoon and hubby also. I was the worst of us. My daughter had an upset stomach but didn't get what  we were reeling with.. geez!
As for waiting for water and drink refills we had the same problem as others had at this location.
I was very disappointed and of course we will NEVER be back again. What a shame.

On one fish I asked for the veggies instead of slaw. Only one chowder was brought waiter thought we were going to share, other soup was brought out about 10 mins later after food was brought out. Neither entrees came with the veggies I asked for. The rest of dinner went fine. Bill came out and we were charged full price for soups instead of the add on with dinner price. the waiter tried to say it was because of tax but eventually checked menu and fixed it. We were charged $9.25 per draft beer and no one told us it was because we get to keep the cups it comes in that we never wanted. Had to look over a menu on the way out to double check draft beer prices to find out we get glass cups.

The menu has good potential but the food you get is nothing like what is described. Our waitress didn't write anything down, which isn't a problem if there are 2-3 people. We were a party of 5 (haha) and I was nervous that things would get forgotten. Things were forgotten. I had the Chinese Chicken Salad and a ""Cheetah-Rita."" The margarita mix was WAY too sweet and I couldn't tastes the alcohol (I may also have a drinking problem.... Yet to be determined). The dressing was about the only thing enjoyable. The chicken was dry like it was from lunch yesterday and may have been overlooked then. My best friend had the Chicken Parmesan and subbed mashed potatoes for the pasta but they brought out pasta anyway... Also forgot the applesauce that was to come with her son's pizza. One of the other girls in our party ordered nachos and asked to have a few things left off as well as extra cheese. The nachos came out with little cheese and all of the things she asked to have omitted. My sister seemed to enjoy her lunch, or at least was not vocal about it. 
Upon coming to check on us, the waitress asked if everything was ok and exclaimed ""Oh no the cooks didn't read the ticket!"" Cooks are not stupid and were certainly not too busy to ignore special requests. Waitresses who don't write anything down are prone to forgetting things.

On our drive home from Las Vegas, we decided to stop in Tempe and treat our 5 year old to lunch at Rainforest Cafe, thinking he would really enjoy it. (Nope.)

The wait was about thirty minutes to get in. The line was all the way from the restaurant to the front of the store, even though half the tables were empty.

The menu was disappointing. The selection is thoroughly ""meh"" and the prices are astronomical. $14 for a mediocre burger? Imagine my surprise at experiencing sticker shock in Tempe after just coming from Las Vegas, land of overpriced food. I ordered a cheesesteak that turned out to be some hard bread stuffed with an overabundance of lettuce and tomatoes. I guess they were trying to make up for the lack of both cheese and steak. To make matters worse, the wait for our food seemed unreasonably long.

The difference was stark. No fish in the fish tanks, half the animals were only partially working, and the fountain smelled of something terrible. It's amazing how quickly a location can go downhill when the owners skimp on proper maintenance. They need to recognize quickly that the sole reason people come to this place is all the things they're cutting in their budgets. If they want to be another Chilis or Applebees then they need to price accordingly. The current prices are extreme given that it is no longer a destination for anything other than food.	2.0

It needs to be at 41° or less and most of the time its 45° and up resulting in food not being properly cooled down. That's gross! Health inspector made the manager throw out food that was taking too long to cool. In one report the manager got the cooler to 41° at the end of the inspection. Meaning they purposely keep it higher to save money. At the risk of bad food! Also most of the food is precooked and simply reheated before you eat it. Almost nothing is fresh. Burgers are pre-made meat mixtures that are cooked on a flat top, not an open flame. Pasta is cooked twice a week and portioned into bags. Multiple issues with the proper sanitation not being used. Things are not properly cleaned and sanitized. I'm not sure if they checked this ever again but the dish washer didn't reach 160° until the 3rd run on one report. This place is just barely scraping by. They either need to close or be forced to change. 

I hadn't been here since I was younger. Went with my mom and boyfriend. We waited in the line for 10 min. Wasn't super long and the place was full. We were seated and a few mins later our server came by and asked what we wanted to drink. Very soon after we had our drinks and he took our order. Everything was going great. Then it hit rock bottom.

Server only came by to refill our drinks, once, in a half and hour. Utterly ridiculous. He told us our food would be out soon. Another 10 mins went by. No food. So in total 45 mins and there was no food, people that came in AFTER us got their food and left. Place was almost empty there's no reason for that. We left money on the table for our drinks. There was a bunch of staff members at the front just talking and slacking off. W told one of the girls and she was more concerned with the money we left than the fact we had to leave because we got no food. Honestly that was the last straw.

The atmosphere is very noisy, but thats a given.  Very kid friendly.  My husband, 10 month old and myself went there yesterday and our food really wasn't that great.  We were greeted nicely and seated pretty quickly, however, we waited for some time before we were finally approached by our server and asked what we wanted to drink. We started with the chili con queso dip and it wasn't anything special, it was good, but it could have used some sprucing up on the flavor. I ordered my little one the pasta with marinara and applesauce and my husband and I ordered the chicken marinara. We waited a long time for our food!  First of all let me say the portion for the child pasta was huge!!! Even for an older child!!! I could have eaten it myself and been full!!  The pasta was cooked al dente, which honestly I didn't expect, most places over cook the pasta which is good for my daughter as she doesn't have any back teeth yet.  I gave her two very small bites then had to return it for a grilled cheese because she kept gagging on the pieces since she couldn't chew them with the pasta being to al dente.  The waitress accommodated and even took the pasta off the check, yay!!   The grilled cheese took forever to come out, I was questioning how long does it take to make a grilled cheese, be it was good, I tried it myself ;)  Our food was ok.  The chicken was cooked perfectly but had way to much cheese melted on top for my liking.  There were two chicken breasts on the plate, pretty good size, for sure over the recommended daily protein intake.  There was a small portion of pasta also.  The sauce was kinda blah, tasted a little like jarred sauce and pretty garlicky..and thats saying something because I love garlic!!  Our bill was $70.00 with tip and all we ordered were our meals, two drinks, the appetizer and kids meal!!! Way too pricey for low to mediocre food.

However, it was dark and cool, so that was ok. The menu has decent variety but an average lunch was about 16 bucks. If i was spending that much at a gimmick eatery, then why not try the steak and shrimp? For 24 bucks, it had to be good right? Wrong. First, they forgot to bring the coconuts shrimp so a manager had to intervene. That'd because our waitress was nowhere to be found. The food was luke warm and of poor quality. The scampi and steak were completely flavorless and not cooked properly. There was no sauce that had flavor either. The shrimp was small and rubbery. The steak had so many fat strands that I could not cut it. When you see over half of the steak on the plate, you might want to ask the customer if something was wrong. Not once did anyone ask how the food was. Even when i filled out a comment card, they still didn't ask. I spent 70 dollars for 3 plates of food. Save your money and go get good food and service elsewhere. Not worth it! We will not be back. Want a gimmick place to eat for 70 bucks? Steer clear of this one.	0.0

When I go to a restaurant with a friend and our two children I do not like to be confronted at our table by a man with a handwritten cardboard sign and a box of candy bars. The gentleman never spoke and roamed the restaurant approaching at least 8 or 9 tables. He had a drink at a table along with an awful lot of supplies. 

I had noticed him before he approached the table because he was an adult male eating alone in what is a restaurant for basically children.

2.) Why does it take over an hour to get 2 burgers and 2  children's meals when there are only 11 tables occupied?

3.) They took 2 of the silver ware off the table. When the 2 children's meals came, they didn't bring any napkins for the kids. I asked for some and was told they would bring them.  We never received them.

You'd think that they'd have more fun or exotic recipes being that it's the Rainforest Cafe but nope, they had a few sandwiches, some salads, a few burgers, some fish items, etc... pretty boring.

I do appreciate that the chef comes out to go over the gluten free options with you. I ordered salmon which came with rice and veggies. It was really lacking flavor. The rice actually had the best flavor of everything on my plate. The vegetables were undercooked. I tried my daughters cheese quesadilla made with corn tortillas. It was decent. Despite only a two rating, we will go back because the kids enjoy the rainforest theme, especially when there's a storm.	0.0

I ordered the ""Taste of the Islands"" and the ""blackened tilapia"" was not blackened and was room temp.  My mashed potatoes were room temp and not very soft.  The scallops were hot-ish, and the shrimp which came late was not all that hot.  
   The way overpriced menu is apparently for the environment, which is falling apart.  The huge fish tank is now fishless, which also took away from the environment.  

   I would not recommend this place at all.  If you're hungry, go to the food court, you'll get better quality and most likely hot food."	4.0

I went here with work since the students were studying the rainforest and how to behave in a restaurant. The service was sloooow, we were there for about 2 hours. The food came out far apart...making some of the kids upset. The food itself was nothing special. I had some mashed potatoes and clam chowder. Chowder was like the stuff you get out of the can... the mashed potatoes were ok, but gluey. The main issue with this place are their prices. They are insanely overpriced. You can't get an adult meal for less than 12$ and those meals are basic sandwiches... the entrees were about 20$... even for pasta.... craziness. Even their entree salads were 15$. I would not come back here.	6.0

I have not been since 2006 at the Mall of America in MN, and previously in Florida. I knew it would be overpriced, but it was so much worse than that. First of all, there was not enough barrier between the seating and the mall, and as I watched the dusty animatronics I could see the shoppers strolling by. The vines were so dusty, and have off the animation was not working right. The rain used to seem so much more intense. 

Next the food. First - bring your own water - every drink tasted like sanitizer!!!! We had the waitress rinse the glasses and bring more and it was better, but than the refills tasted like a band aid again. Next, some of the portions were decent - my father in law got the fish and chips - it looked good, had cole slaw and fried. I got the coconut shrimp - about $4 more - had mini scoop of cold icky mashed potatoes and 8 small shrimp stretched on a skewer. Literally, my daughter's kid's plate had more food on it and that was other people's comments not mine. The shrimp did not taste bad, it was just a sorry excuse for almost $20! It should have had a veggie and maybe a salad or bread to boot!  BTW, my wife who is 1/3rd my size had the same meal and also walked away hungry.

So, ambiance was lacking -- it looked like a tired old carnival ride. Food was way overpriced, food portions inconsistent.

Than, I said something to the manager. I waited until it was over because my wife hates it if  I complain, and it was my daughter's birthday. All she said was sorry. I could tell she has heard it before. There was certainly no customer service going on here.

For the next birthday I am going to blow the money on a birthday party instead of a nice meal, or else, go somewhere good for food and find entertainment elsewhere."	1.0

The service was beyond slow! The wait staff was not kind at all. We were not looking to make friends with the waiter but looking to at least have good service. We asked for a cup of ice water and the waiter bought me a cup with a splash on lemonade with water. The water had a cloudy look and you could clearly taste that there was a water lemonade mix. The waiter wanted to give push back on this drink. All the food that we ordered was horrible. They have changed up the menu and removed a lot of our favorites. We do realize times have changed so the menu has to change but please replace it with foods that are good and makes sure your cooks know what they are doing!

If it wouldn't have been for his birthday, we would have left, even though it's a hour + drive from our home. As others have mentioned, the service is very slow. We had to wait a few minutes to be seated even though there was no one in front of us. Once seated, we had to wait a while before our waitress came. By the time she came, we already knew what we wanted to order, so we went ahead and gave it to her. The group sitting next to us got their food before us. About 10-15 minutes after that we asked the manager. After he checked on the order, he informed us that our waitress had not put in our order. He then offered us 50% off our meal, and put our order in. We got our food fairly quick after that. I was hoping to be offered something small prior to our food, but no such luck. Everyone was pleased with the food. My club was just an average club though. When we got our check, they charged us for an adult size soda with the kids meal. It was supposed to include a drink. It was also my son's birthday, so we informed them. They came over and sang and gave him a cupcake. They then charged us for the cupcake also. Oh well, at least we got it for 50% off!	0.0

My husband and I went for dinner at about 5:15 on a Saturday night. The line of people waiting for seating was very long. I noticed lots of parents and kids waiting to see the hostess for a table in the dining room. In typical ""me first"" fashion, some patrons chose to bypass the line of families by cutting through the bar area and approaching the hostess station from the side. I'm not sure how the hostess didn't realize they had cut the line by going around. But their tactic worked, because the line-cutters did get seated in the dining room before everyone else that was waiting in line. My husband and I decided to go into the bar to ask if the seating in the bar was first-come, first-served (as is often the case). We stood at the bar, hoping to ask the bartender if we could sit there. We stood and waited...and waited...and waited some more. One bartender ignored us as another bartender kept going back and forth to two women because all their credit cards were being denied. Finally, I sat down at a bar table just to rest my feet. At that point, a waiter approached me with menus. I asked if we could sit there and he said yes. I called over my hubby, who was STILL waiting for a bartender to acknowledge him. After perusing the menu, we ordered the tortilla chips and queso sauce for an appetizer. It was over $8. We were served a tiny bowl of Velveeta type stuff on a large plate with a handful of stale tortilla chips. The waiter didn't even give us appetizer plates, so we had to keep pushing the bowl on the plate back and forth across the table so as not to spill the fake cheese. (He did not come back to check on us; otherwise I would've asked for appetizer plates). For dinner, my hubby got a shrimp platter with 3 different types of shrimp. He said the meal was just ""ok"". I got the veggie burger. It, too, was maybe ""ok"". It definitely wasn't worth its $12-$13 price. My husband had a soda and I had ice tea. When the bill came, my hubby looked at it and said,""oh, wow"". He doesn't usually say anything like that unless he really feels he's overpaying for something. Later I learned that the bill was over $60 when the 15% tip was included! $60!!! We didn't even drink alcohol! That's just too much money to pay for lazy servers and bad food. Skip it!"	0.0

I guess this is typical and I almost wonder if it's some ploy to make the place look more busy than it is. 

Anyways, we get seated finally and we're in the corner. A round table and with no view of pretty much anything. Kids could hear the elephants but didn't get to see squat. To make it worse, the stupid table wasn't positioned well so basically, we had to wedge it against the other end of the simi-circle to even get in. 

App were okay but the spinach artichoke dip was so overcooked it was nearly hard.

Got the main food and disappointing doesn't even cover my dish. Blacken tilapia w/ mango salsa. The salsa was so bland and did nothing for the poor tasting fish. Shrimp and scallops in cheese sauce. So if you're like me, maybe you're expecting a white cheese. Nope. American. Like Velveeta. Over the tiniest shrimp and scallops I've ever seen. Only saving grace was the coconut shrimp. They actually tasted good. Oh and the mashed potatoes but if you can mess those up, you deserved to be flogged.

Now at this point I think, whatever. Maybe I just got the wrong meal. Granted it was a $24 mistake but I'm not making that mistake with the desert. I get the volcano. Brownie, whipped cream, vanilla ice cream, and fudge/caramel sauce. No, just no. The signature dish that's freaking everywhere is just bad. I can honestly say, it would have been better if the bought box mix and made it up. 

So all of this doesn't really warrant the one star but this is one of those meals that keeps on giving, if you catch my drift. The hour spent in the bathroom was the final straw. 

My suggestion, go when it's not busy if the kids just have to go. Order the cheapest thing on the menu and split it. Then go to the food court and get something else. You'll be safer that way."	2.0

I've experienced. Such a classless establishment where customer service is the last thing on their mind. I have dined in several times at the old location and once now at the new location, they take forever to even recognize you once you sit down, and then act bothered when you ask for anything. I won't be back to this hole in the wall. I agree with all the prior reviews about quality going down. Not sure who the Man with the raspy voice is, maybe the owner but he should let someone else takeover his time serving has expired long ago. I'm going to predict they will soon go out of business unless they change the way they operate , completely."	0.0

My server was Diane and immediately we were greeted with an angry hello. All she said after that was ""drinks?"". We all ordered a round of beer (which we had to repeat the name of at least 3 times) and waited for our drinks while she talked bad about another server on duty not even 5 feet from the table. We could hear all the f-bombs she dropped within those 10 minutes of our drinks being delivered. After that she hardly checked on us, and when she did, she wasnt friendly. I asked her for another beer and she mumbled something under her breath and asked me to say it again louder. So instead dealing with an attitude like that I asked for the bill, paid, and left.

Always excellent servers
Always good food

Cons: 

Shitty, clueless owner
Price increases

I've been extremely reluctant to write this review, due to the respect I've had for this bar over the last few years, but this place has turned into an utter abomination of what it used to be. 

Not only have the 50 cent wings from 2 years ago turned to 70 cent wings. Apparently the ""wing night"" as the owner refers to it, has been abolished altogether as of tonight: no reason nor logic to it.

I've never seen nor heard of a place completely alienate whatever ""demographic"" they were attempting to cater to. Give me $2,000 a week and I'll come up with better ideas than convict night or free homeless poker night.

For the sake of brevity, I'll end my post like this: stop coming up with stupid ideas like imitation fish bites and start selling wings and draft beer at reasonable prices like they used to be. 

Also, no real Buffalonian would ever step foot in a Steelers bar on Sundays for a $14 dozen and $4.50 bud light bottle. The owner should be ashamed of himself; that's if he really is from western NY.

I watched as one of their employees who was either on drugs or completley intoxicated harass the customers On the patio..she started out with two girls which. Both asked for her to leave them alone... She was in their face and totally abnoxious i dont know why security. Or the managers of that bar would let her conduct herself that way. When she was walking away from the original girls she was harassing...then a poor girl that had nothing to do with it standing a couple feet away got pushed and the employee knocked the drink out of her hand... And then rushed her... I witnessed 4 security guards hold her the customer down while that employee.. Punched her over and over..never once trying to stop their employee or hold her back... who had attacked this poor girl for nothing..  They held her down and didnt let her defend herself while there employee struck this girl over and over..one of thw mexican security guards i guess helpes his wife by also hitring her....Then after picked her up and  dumped her over the railing like a rag doll... I believe the woman on drugs was a mother to the door girl.. Because i witnessed her yelling thats my mom... Ya mom fuck her up... Either way i hope that poor girl is ok .. And to the owners you should be ashamed of your employees and security... If i was that poor innocent customer i would sue you closed.. So dont go here a bunch of thugs and women beaters...	0.0

I'll just go a few more miles to Paradise on Gilbert or even better, Kneaders at San Tan Mktplc. They get 5 stars from me!	0.0

We sat down and my lunch was brought to me, ok, the sandwich was barely a sandwich, the portion of meathad to have been for a child of 2 yrs, I went up to the sandwich counter and asked if this was correct in size, the girl behind the counter stated that it was, that as Panera, they are only allowed to use the pre portions.  As I ate my sandwich I noticed a odd taste, I thought that it tasted like horse radish, I went to the front counter to read the cluttered menu board to see if it was there, no, it wasn't I asked four the manager, a young lady asked if I had a problem, I shared that if they are going to put horse radish on a sandwich they should show that and not make it a surprise, I Hate Horse Radish.  The bun for my sandwich was so big that it weighed three time what the meat did.

There's no place to wait in line. The dining room is cramped. The kids working here don't give a damn. And, as another reviewer mentioned, the patio is--for reasons inconceivable to anyone who's even visited Arizona--on the west side of the building. I get that Ocotillo is full of cold-blooded elderly people, but even my nonagenarian iceberg-veined grandfather declared it ""too damn hot to sit in the sun.""

The food was... edible. Soups and salads were actually pretty decent. The sandwiches, most of which are lifted wholesale from Paradise's menu, were not good, with weird, tough, chewy bread, less meat than Paradise, and absolutely no care in their prep. (Including chunks of skin still on my avocado. Appetizing!) Tea was stale, frozen drinks were half-melted before being delivered, service was slow, and nothing came out together.

Drive the extra five minutes to Paradise at Germann & Gilbert instead. Better food, better service, and you get a free cookie. Or if you really don't mind a drive, the Paradise at Ray & Price is head and shoulders above both."	2.0

From the half-hearted attempt at beautifying prepackaged food to the complete abandonment of functionality, this place is a step below the corner QuikTrip. No ice. No clean tables. No available highchairs. Table service from a Walker straight out of your favorite post-apocalyptic cable drama.

The macaroni is made-to-order out of an envelope. The salad materials look like they were prepared by a tool from the 'As Seen On TV' store. The chicken, when it was fresh, was part of a juggling act, it seems. And all of this is served at your table by a girl who can only be described as walking through life as though she were in locked-in syndrome, mobile but trapped in her own living hell.

What about the layout, you ask? Well, I'll tell you. If you want to walk in the most logical door, you end up sidestepping around people's table in the tiny dining room. Then you arrive at the counter, where queuing theory is more like chaos theory. Once you place your order, you go sit down. Then you get back up and push your way into a little corner right next to where the food is served. Maybe you get to the fountains, maybe not. Then you push your way back out of the throng and shuffle around more cramped tables until you sit at one of the 2 clean tables and crunch white salad, tasteless cold cuts and bland bread.

Did you ever make it out to Paradise? Over by Grimaldi's and the excellent greek place, Cyprus Grill? Yeah, well that was pretty good food, and a nice, relaxed and comfortable atmosphere. This place, however, makes me want to spit bile. It would taste better than what they are serving."	4.0

For 39$ we should get more than a handful of macaroni, soup, and salad (the tiny cups they gave us were only halfway full). Also, for 39$ the customer service should be better than a taco bell, but it is not. The teenagers working here are rude and careless. The young lady on the drive-through intercom failed to even mention that they were OUT of Panini bread. How do you run out of panini bread when half of your menu is paninis?! The nicer young man at the drive through counter had to explain to us that the panini bread was out and asked what bread they could substitute but this should have been explained immediately by the young woman when I was actually ordering it. Panera is a poorly managed joke. I cannot wait to see Panera go out of business! You would think that regional managers and other higher ups in Panera would look at the pathetic reviews regarding this particular location and actually do something to fix it before they continue to lose more and more customers but it is obvious that they don't care.	0.0

First of all they don't have sour dough bread here just plain rolls (yuk) and the lettuce was old I have to pick though to get a decent bite and the soup was luke warm. Very disappointed. The only  nice thing about this place was the friendly workers.  Not worth the drive here	0.0

Ordered a chicken Cobb salad with avocado and an iced tea. For $12 it was a little pricey. Drink is small and salad is probably an average size. I'm a little bit of an iced tea snob and I didn't like it, I don't think it was powdered but just didn't like the kind they brewed. I didn't get the salad I ordered. That's annoying to me especially in a drive thru- at lunch. I drive off thinking I get the right one and I don't have time on my lunch break to go fix it. They need to get it right. Also, they gave me a bread roll. The roll was just floating around in the bag. Not in anything, no butter, nothing. I found that very strange.

The drive thru girl was not nice or friendly to top it all off.

I ordered an iced mocha that came completely unstirred. What I ended up with was a mouthful of chocolate syrup, because the milk/espresso was all on top, with a pile of chocolate on the bottom. What drive thru DOESN'T STIR DRINKS? (Yeah, that's what we want to do, open a drink, in our car, and try to stir chocolate syrup into a cold beverage...)
The sandwich was good, though VERY small compared to places like wildflower bread Co., and paradise bakery. Also, the tuna to mayo/dressing ratio seems to be off. I feel like I got a sandwich that was mostly mayo. I don't think I'll return for that. 
All in all, 11 bucks (after tax) for a coffee drink and a sandwich. That price seems high, for what I received, after a verrrrrry loooonnnnggg wait. I think I would rather go elsewhere."	0.0

When my food was delivered to my table the soup wasnt very warm.  Panera Bread makes me miss Paradise Bakery.  I am accustomed to getting a cookie with my meal but not here at Panera Bread.  Their whole process just seemed very slow and maybe it's because it's a new location with new employees. Well, its been a while now and their customer service still sucks. Every time the wife wants to go here I cringe because I know that it may be a while to order. The drive thru is a nightmare and I have been stuck in line a couple times waiting for what seemed like forever. One time someone changed their order after getting to the window to pick up their food and instead of having the person wait in the parking lot they just had them waiting at the window until the order was changed.

There were no condiments on my husband sandwich, dry bread and it was nothing better than what I would make at home. It was a basic sac lunch. I had the broc soup and bread bowl. What a fail. Tasted like frozen soup, the bowl was hard as a rock. My salad had wilted and brown lettuce. I couldn't even eat it. My kids MAC and cheese was disgusting.

What just happened?

Our server eventually makes it to our table, takes our drink order after I inquire about how they make their Bourbon Sours here.  Silly me, I want it like the old school Whiskey Sour with that maraschino cherry sunk in the bottom.  She's not sure if they include that but she's gonna add it per my request.
Don't ask me why but I was in the mood for a classic cocktail.  Something my Mom or Dad might have drank back in the 50's or 60's.
Here ya go:
1 1/2 ounces whiskey (or bourbon, Scotch, Canadian whiskey, or Irish whiskey)
4 ounces sour mix, recipe follows
Crushed ice
1 maraschino cherry
Combine the whiskey and sour mix in a large old-fashioned glass with ice. Stir, garnish with cherry, and serve.
Sour Mix: 
1-ounce lemon juice
1-ounce sugar
2 ounces water
Combine lemon juice and sugar, then dilute with water and stir to dissolve sugar

My cocktail arrived and was more reminisce of bourbon with bar sour mix.  
It was okay, but not what I had hoped for.

Dinner was a veggie plate combo for me and my husband ordered the ribs.
Server brings over dinner rolls and our salads.  Dinner rolls were darker than usual and they were hard.  So hard that I thought there was a greater risk to my teeth than what I might experience from biting an apple.
I am not exaggerating.
Our server came by again, not to check on us but to apologize because there were no more ribs and she wanted to find out what other entrée my husband would like.
So he orders up the Chicken Fried Steak and she thought he might want to change his sides but he opted to leave that the same.
I also asked if we could get some fresh rolls and she then apologized for the quality of what was initially delivered to the table because the current batch was in the oven.
No worries, when they're done we'd like to have a couple.
When our meals are finally delivered a basket of rolls are brought along with.  
Hot, Hot, Hot dinner rolls.  Burning hot.  So hot I cut it with my knife and fork so it would cool off a bit.
But oh they were soft and much easier to eat.  

Overall our server was pleasant.
The food was okay.  
The cocktail was okay.
The water was horrible -or maybe it was my glass.
I wouldn't opt to go there again anytime soon.  It was only because I had a gift card did we opt to go there and use it.
I think we'll stick with one of the other steak and ribs restaurants next time."	5.0

Upon entering,  no one was at the reception desk and only about four tables in the entire restaurant were occupied.  After standing there for about three minutes, a busboy appeared from the rear the restaurant and pushed his tray on empty table and went and grabbed us some menus and took us to a table. He was clearly ill at ease, waiting on us in this role. He seated us gave us our menus and told us the server would be with you shortly. Despite the fact the restaurant was nearly empty, it still took three or four minutes before a server appeared. I was informed that the catfish that reallyI liked was no longer being served. When I decided to try a new fish and chips item being served, the server said ""you should know that some people do not care for the coleslaw that we serve with this meal because of the way it's made,""  I asked her if I could substitute something else in place of the coleslaw? She said no. I told her I was more than willing to pay an additional cost to substitute another side. She said no, that I had to take the coleslaw.  My question is why tell a person an item is not good when you're unwilling to do anything about it.  As it turned out, she was correct and neither my wife or I chose to eat coleslaw, so was discarded, uneaten.  Other than the coleslaw, we found the rest of the meal to be very good.  After completing the meal, we presented our server with a five dollar off coupon that we been emailed along with our credit card.   After about three or four minutes, our server came by and informed us that there was a delay in processing our payment due affected no one could find a manager and he had to approve the five dollar discount.  The bottom line during our visit was that we got good food and horrible service. They showed absolutely no respect for our time.  After many years of going to Logan's, I can assure you this was our last time.  They recently closed the restaurant closest to our home and we drove over 20 miles to eat at this location.  Logan's name used to stand for great restaurant, now we realize that is a thing of the past."	2.0

The food was very good. My t-bone stake was very yumi explosive taste was a little over cooked though for medium barley any pink. My server would have known this is she ever bothered to stop bye our table and ask, I guess its asking to much for  some one to do there job. I was a server not that diffucult.

She never came back to ensure it was good.  My server asked how it was at the end of the meal when the only thing I had eaten was my steamed broccoli and potato and so I was honest about it and he said oh well and cleared the plate.

The experience started with watching the couple ahead of us get seated.  We were told when the server came back that he would seat us. Didn't go as planned.  The hostess who said that proceeded to seat two different tables from people who came behind my party.  All while I'm looking at an empty clean and ready to go table five feet in front of my party.   After not getting service and watching the hostess station have three kiddos siting there looking confused my party left while I asked to see the manager.  After I watched one of the middle schoolers walk around the restaurant looking for him he finally graced me with his presence.  He said he would seat my party right now.  But I explained my party had left and I was too.  He gave appetizers in hopes I would come back to use them.   After I got home I read the card I was yet again disappointed.  There was a dollar limit on the appetizers so you had to get the cheap appetizers in addition to buying an entree at a set price.

The bartender never cleaned the counter, proceeded to ignore the piece of broccoli & used napkin in front of me left behind from a former guest and still delivered my food without cleaning. That alone made me scared to eat the food. Simply Gross. I shouldn't have to ask for a clean counter to order/eat from. Second, I ordered a filet and broccoli. Everything tasted like it had marinated in salt for a day. If you have to do that with filet to tenderize it, you may either be buying from the wrong distributor or have an awful chef. In either case, they are ruining a good piece of meat. On the plus side, their top shelf margarita was pretty good.	1.0

I had a chicken avacado sandwich that I took one bite out of and spit it out. It had a weird burnt smell but wasnt burnt? My date had the ribs and chicken strips. Same issue for him, took one bite and spit it.. It almost had a gasoline type of odor that neither one of us had smelt before on food. I attempted to take the food home and funny story my dog wouldnt even go near it... He walked up to it, smelt it and walked away (my dog will eat a cardboard box if I put it in his bowl) Only good thing here was the $5 presidente margarita they offer on football Sundays.	0.0

The manager came on the phone & explained that she had a protocol, questions she had to ask for their insurance company in case we sued. I told her we were not going to sue, but she asked them nonetheless. She concluded by saying she wanted to mail me some coupons for 2 free meals. I gave her our address, but she NEVER SENT THEM. Phoney half-job doer manager.

Next we were given an online form to fill out for the Maricopa County Health Department, which we did. I'm changing her rating from 2 stars to one star and we WILL NOT BE BACK, and it's a shame. We always liked Chili's, because they have a very wide spectrum menu.

((ORIGINAL REVIEW FOLLOWS:
Went there about 1:45 PM Sunday, 13 DEC 2015. They said it'd be a 15 minute wait. My wife went straight to the restroom and the table closest to the restrooms was clean and empty. After about 20 minutes they showed us to that same empty table. WHY DID IT SIT EMPTY FOR 20 MINUTES? Work slowdown? Or not enough help to get the job done?  The place was very crowded and the staff was plenty busy. I had a California Turkey sandwich. Excellent taste, well prepared,

My wife had the Quesadilla EXPLOSION Salad and it was as good tasting as it was aptly named, because it caused her an intestinal explosion of diarrhea and stomach pain. I'll phone the restaurant and let the county health dept know as well.

Maybe it's too close to Chipotle (which is next door). Maybe their bugs have migrated west that 75 feet or so to Chilis."	0.0

Waters had floaties-yuk. The waitress says it looks like it's from lemons so of course we say we didn't have lemons with our water. So we get some new waters. Next is the appetizer- chips, salsa & bean dip with a side of hair in the beans. The kid's fries came with a complimentary salt like. So much salt on these bad boys you'd think it was a cured prime rib. Chicken came out raw so that went back to the kitchen. 
But my favorite of all the unpleasantries was the fact that I had to try & enjoy my meal with a stack full of dirty plates in my face the whole entire meal. 
My girlfriend had a nice friendly chat with the manager & he comped our entire meal. I always feel bad for complaining but there was so much wrong that sometimes you gotta stand up & say something."	1.0

This as a parent means this is a non family oriented restaurant, my son has Autism with sensory issues to loud places (like the bar area) and if I sit 3 ft from the bar area in regular seating I have to pay more for the same food or drinks than the people sitting in the bar area, personally kids shouldn't sit in the bar area because there is a lot of adult conversation and cuss words that get used. Bottom line I will not be visiting another Chili establishment, there are to many family restaurants that have equal quality of food and are more children friendly.

First of all, the wait staff was great, very attentive and friendly. However, the food was not good. One of the dishes I regularly order at Chili's is the Margarita Chicken. I ordered this, and seriously it did not taste like any other Margarita Chicken I've ordered. The beans, are suppose to be black, these tasted like baked red beans, the ones you get from a can. The rice, I don't even know what was wrong with it, but it was disgusting! The chicken had this sauce on it, that I've never seen before. And it was kinda under done.

1283	__IFWGnWgMJV-55JIQfzjw	0.0	0.0	1.0	WARNING!! On Veteran's Day, my friends and I had the WORST experience at the Chili's location on Signal Butte in Mesa, AZ. Two of my friends and I went in for a nice meal and left angry and disgusted. It was slightly busy, but not crazy. We were told that we'd have three waiters helping us since they were sharing the area. That was pretty much the last we saw of anybody. Well, I did see our main server standing at the computer almost the entire time. My friend and I got the 2 for $20, both with chicken fajitas and an app of chips and salsa, and her husband ordered a steak. After watching 4 other tables being served their chips, we finally got ours. We got through the entire plate of chips and sat there staring at the empty bowl until we we were able to flag a server down (not the one who was supposed to be our main server, she was still at the computer) and got a refill. We finished that as well and then waited another 20 minutes for our meals to arrive. Neither of our fajitas were sizzling and both were barely warm. My friend's husband's steak was flat out cold. It was obvious they had been left dying in the window. Since we couldn't get our waitress's attention, we just ate. They no longer put lids on the tortillas and instead wedge a small plate in the container. After prying the plate out, I realized there was nothing between the bottom of the plate and my tortillas. That is incredibly UNSANITARY. I don't know what that plate was sitting on in the kitchen. I'm pretty positive there are health codes against that. We had to flag down another server to get refills on our water. It had been so long, the ice had melted and I drank that while waiting to find anybody to refil our glasses. The three tables that had finished and left before we got our food hasn't been bussed and we were starting at dirty plates during our entire meal. We finally found a manager and he just kept saying it was a busy night with a few unconvincing apologies thrown in. There were empty tables and booths from the time we arrived at 7 until we finally left at 9. It was NOT busy enough for that complete lack of service or cleanliness. When my friend's husband asked if being busy was a good reason for poor food quality and service, the manager said the numbers show it was busy. I'm sorry but a manager should NEVER mention the numbers, especially as an excuse to an upset guest. He didn't even care about the sanitation issues. Starting at other people's dirty dishes for over an hour, food that had clearly been left out, and having the bottom of dishes touching our food is just revolting. Add that to the lack of service and uncaring attitude, I will not only never go to Chili's again but will also discourage anybody else from going. As it is, I'm tempted to call the health department. The following day we called the location and got the same manager we had complained to. He said that he didn't remember talking to any upset guests the night before. When I contacted corporate, they just sent an automated email saying they were going to send us a coupon for a free meal (because we really want to go back to a restaurant that doesn't care about health codes).	0.0

The waitress wouldn't come and check on us and at least apologize for the food taking so long. Finally got our food about 45 minutes later.  I got the baby back ribs and they were so dry. My daughter got a medium well steak that wasn't cooked correctly and my bf got soggy chicken crispers. The waitress never came by to ask how our food was, she probably knew our answer. I got the managers attention and let her know of our situation and she took a whole 8 dollars off...yay. I ended up paying 35 for a terrible dinner that we didn't enjoy. They didn't give us a receipt, probably didn't want us to do the survey. We will never go to this location ever again.	0.0

One thing my wife and I did find exceptionally annoying, though, was our waitress. She paid almost no attention to our table and, when she did, she tried to cram in as many of her duties at once. For instance, halfway through our meal, both of us still eating and with forks in hand, she asks, ""Can I get you some boxes to go? Will you be having any dessert?"" We told her that we weren't sure about either yet as we were still mid-meal but that we'd let her know. However, she never checked back with us and we didn't see her again until 15 minutes after we had both finished entirely when she brought the check. 

Also, we received only one water refill the entire time (pre-meal) in which she spilled water all over the table filling my glass and then said to me, ""I'll bring you some extra napkins so you can soak that up."" Huh? ME clean that up??

We again went to sit in the bar area because we didn't want to wait for regular seating, we probably should have. At first, it seemed like service would be good in the bar area. They quickly cleared the table we wanted and then the waiter got us our non-alcoholic drinks and took our order which was a simple appetizer for dinner for my wife and two side dishes for my dinner. He then proceeded to go to the next table to get their order before placing ours. No big deal seen it before but over heard the next table ordering full entrees for dinner. We then proceeded to wait almost a full hour before I lost my patience and asked for the manager when the table next to us got their food and ours was nowhere to be seen and the waiter had not stopped by to check on us or give us any kind of apology for the delay. When the manager showed up I told him we were leaving and not paying for anything just as our simple order finally showed to the table. He tried to apologize and COMP our meal but I didn't want it due to this being the second time the service by the bar area staff had fallen. I told him that this was the second time in a row to this location and that the bar staff was horrible. WE WILL NOT BE BACK TO THIS LOCATION NO MATTER WHAT!

The bartender was not very nice, I think he was annoyed that we made it before happy hour ended (with about 20 minutes to spare), so we got 2 fancy cocktails at $5 each - great for us, but we didn't appreciate his attitude. The waitress, on the other hand, was a doll. Very sweet and made sure we were taken care of. 

The food was mediocre. If it was cheaper, we would have loved it, but it was about $20 per plate, which in any other situation would be no big deal, but the portions were small and the food was that of a typical cheap italian place, so we thought it should be priced as so.

I don't know if it is new management or what but we used to enjoy coming here, never again. At least not the one at Desert Ridge. So we were seated promptly which was probably the only good thing and I should have known considering the restaurant was half empty on a Saturday night at 6pm. Well after we were seated it took almost 20min for our waiter to show up. After that I started to time things because I had a bad feeling it was going to be a bad experience. We were a pretty large group 8 of us out to celebrate  Easter. Will after our drink order was taken it took almost 15min to get our drinks and get our order. I am pretty sure our waiter was high as a kite based upon the way he was acting. Real jerky movements didn't seem to know where he was half the time it was bad. which Ill get to more in a minute. So once we got our drinks and ordered salads etc. It took another 27minutes for our salads to show  and no waiter ins sight the entire time along with my 3 year olds dinner which was a piece of charcoal chicken. When the waiter came and  brought our salads he also knocked my wife's Coach purse off the chair and onto the nasty floor. He stopped looked at it for almost 10 seconds and then mumbled to himself and continued to hand us the salads. He asked if wanted pepper or cheese then walked off didn't even ask to pick my wife's purse. So about 1 min later he came back and asked us if we wanted pepper or cheese ....again. Well we said you already asked us and we said no. He had a confused look on his face and walked off. No Joke 2min later he comes back AGAIN and asks again, at this point I don't know if he's just being a jerk or truly doesn't know he asked 2 other times. Also this entire time we have empty glasses. Finally another waiter came over and filled our drinks for us. So after about 20 more minutes, Our food comes, by this time we are all starving and I was wondering why they brought out my daughters food so  early as it was now cold. Well the food was ok, I got the chicken Caccatorie and it was eh so-so. The chicken was like chewing a piece of rubber. Needless to say the waiter didn't get a very good tip and I will not be going to this particular Macaroni Grill again....Ever. I now the reason this place was half empty on a Saturday night.

I really wanted something more authentic, MUCH larger balls. . .  And this was not even close.  My mom got a steak that she snarfed down b/c she was starving.  My sister got a salmon dish that was, by far, the star of the show. I didn't get a taste of it - but it looked great and my sis said it was very good.  I wish I had ordered that!

2)finally a waitress or hostess comes greed us and just says ""two"" i say yes and she just walls we a assume we have to fallow, she finds this waiter starts chasing with him and then she drops the menus on the table. Not even a "" here have a seat,  or recommendations of what's good there"" just drops the menu,  my friend lips at me and smiles, and tells "" maybe jeans and a t-shirt aren't a good attire to wear here "".
3)we sat in the table for a good 15min and nothing, nobody came to say,  if we were ok,  I f we were ready to order,  or absolutely nothing! 
4)I got impatient but I was also astonish at their service that I wanted to see how long will they ignore us. I started to drop hints wherever a waiter or waitress pass by like ""Are you serious 15min and not even water"" or I guess we are invisible""  and ""nobody seems to see us"". My friend got upset and walk out, I hear to fallow her. But we were ignore for about 20-25 min.  And not even when we walk out we where notice. 

I do not know if they had a more dressy dress code,  if maybe they are prejudice because we were two women,  or because we were young or because we are Latinas. This by far was the worse service experience of my life!  I do not want to go back,  but my friend does so we will probably try it again and maybe go not looking so casualand hopefully we get better service. Or maybe try a different location, since the setting and decor was nice, maybe at a different location they will acknowledge us."	1.0

After we sat down, it took almost 10 minutes for our waiter to come to our table even though the restaurant was not crowded.  When he finally came, he never gave us a drink menu or offered us a drink.  We watched all of the tables who came in around us get bread, but our waiter never brought bread.  When we asked for bread a few minutes after placing our order, the waiter claimed our bread was in the oven.  Since the kitchen is open, we were tempted to go take our own salads from the kitchen.  Although we saw the salads being made, our waiter did not bring the salads over for another 10 minutes.  Our entrees came out approximately three minutes after we received our salads.  Our waiter never recognized that there was an issue with his service, but the waiter who delivered the entrees realized that we just received our salads when he brought the entrees.

The restaurant does not appear to be well managed at all.  While there appeared to be managers in the restaurant, they never once came to the table or recognized what a poor job our server was doing.

Overall it was a terrible experience and the food is sub-par at best.  I definitely would not visit this location again and likely would not eat at another Macaroni Grill again.  When the service and food are both bad, there is no reason to go back."	0.0

We arrived and were taken to our seats where we sat waiting about 15 minutes for the waitress to even come see us. When she did she asked if we wanted to try the house red. I said yes, since it was only $6 so why not. She proceeded to pour it in a regular juice glass! What? This is wine not tang. Lol. Whatever though.

Shortly after another waiter brought us the bread which was probably the best part of the meal. We cut and ate through almost all of it before she came over with their vinaigrette to try on the bread which was gone. Too little too late.

Finally our food arrived and the person who brought it out put the cheese on my Penne Rustica and also into my water glass and walked away. 5 minutes later our waitress comes out with the cheese grater asking if we'd like cheese on our food. Very strange.

My wife got their Chicken under Brick which she said was okay but the potatoes looked iffy and I'll eat just about anything in potato form. My Penne Rustica was inedible. It tasted like nothing but char and I normally love a little char flavor but this was BAD. The chicken in it was slimy and the shrimp tasted like it had gone bad. I just wanted to get out of there so we paid our bill and left. I had to chew multiple sticks of gum to get that flavor out of my mouth.

It was almost 8pm when we came in and despite the many empty tables, they sat a family wiith littles to my back. So, I got to enjoy a little guy smacking his pizza in my ear, because he was turning around in the booth the whole time.

He ordered spaghetti and ricotta meatballs with bolognese. It was dry, unfortunately.
The complimentary bread is nice and the calamari was good. I enjoyed the pesto and I think it was a truffle mayo.
I ordered a steak and greens salad. It was so salty! Just a clunky plate all around.....blue, briny cheese, crisped prosciutto, salted steak, and likely salt in a very heavy dressing. The kale had long stems. And those horrid onion straws showed up on top. It just seems like a place like this that charges these menu prices could skip the bar food.

Asked me again about wine and I said I really just wanted some water, and she said they were all out of glasses. She finally poured some into the little glasses they use for wine. No ice. We drained the bottle they put at the table and never saw another one. Ordered the house wine and it was undrinkable. Food was all overly salted (and we had no water!). I had Pasta Rustica, which is supposed to have prosciutto. Instead, there were these thick strips of some kind of ham. Prosciutto is typically sliced very thin. Weird. Also, we ordered salad and got the food first. The server blamed the waitress, who said they were all out of bowls. Maybe they should order some more dishes and glasses! Finally, desert sounded good but was dried out chocolate cake. They serve it with whipped cream and chocolate sauce, probably because the cake is so dry.

He placed the bread on the table and was gone for greater than 5 minutes. We asked for water while waiting on our ice tea. We grabbed plates and silverware off of the table a few steps away, he was not knowledgeable about the menu or the portion size, and did not offer to refill any of the ice teas as the glasses were obviously empty. Even after I asked for him to bring water for one of the children. Never did water arrive to the table nor did Austin ask to refill any of the empty ice tea glasses.

Reluctantly, she brought us those menus. My daughter and I ordered a starter Caesar salad and the Parmesan Truffle Fries, along with 2 pasta dishes.

(I always thought it was a mixture of fresh ground herbs that the server added to the oil--nope! Just pepper.) I was disappointed in the bread--cold and dry. We asked for another loaf, hoping for a fresh one, but more of the same bland disappointment. It was ""too late"" for good bread, I guess. She gave us very little oil, but left the bottle on the table, and was very light on the pepper. I asked for more and she ground two more twists. I just added pepper from the shaker. Salads were delivered just minutes after we gave our order and they were delicious (all Caesar). Our main dishes were prompt to our table, as well. The breaded sole was beautifully presented and a generous portion, though a little heavy on the butter, still delicious. The rice pilaf was unremarkable, but complemented the sole nicely. The rest of our party ordered Pasta Milano, one added pine nuts. It was difficult to discern which dish had the added pine nuts, since the addition was so small. When the dishes were delivered, no fresh grated Parmesan was offered. We requested it from Lynette and after a false start of an empty grater, we were able to top off our dishes with the cheese. The Pasta Milano was unremarkable. The mushrooms were not sautéed well...they were stiff and almost crunchy, as if they were just coated in the olive oil/butter mixture in the pan and added to the dish. I didn't feel like the sauce had matured, either. One in our party ordered coffee and our server never checked to see if she needed more. We had to remind her for a refill and both cups were strong and bitter. We placed a to go order that was delivered promptly, but without any bread. I had to ask for a loaf and she brought two. We had asked for separate checks when we ordered and she said to remind her if she forgot at the end of the meal. (I thought that was odd.) When the bill came, she had indeed forgotten the separate bill request. It took five minutes to get her attention and change the bill. I was disappointed in our evening out. The company and conversation was wonderful, but the food and some of the service was well below par. We will be frequenting other establishments from now on."	3.0

My mother and I came in for lunch and a female waitress came to seat us. As she walked us to our table she stopped to help another table and just pointed at the table we were supposed to sit at while she was helping the other table. Very rude. 

Next we waited about 15 minutes without our server even introducing themselves, however several servers stared at us and noticed we were there. Finally our server comes to the table and seems to be all over the place. She takes our drink order and brings out our bread and drinks but doesn't bring any silverware. 

Finally she comes to take our order and we ask her if we can use the coupon on the lunch special, we didn't know because the coupon doesn't specify. She asks her manager and she says we can. While she's taking our order she is also talking to two other servers and not really paying attention to us. 

She brings us our salads and when she puts cheese on the salad she asks us to say when to stop. I'm waiting to get the right amount of cheese on the salad and she stops without me saying when. She walks away without giving us silverware. Wait another five minutes to ask for silverware. 

Our food comes out, my mothers food is cold and mine isn't even what I ordered. It's covered in mushrooms, which I'm allergic to. I send it back and the waitress says she accidentally brought out the wrong food. My mom compares her ravioli to chef boiardee. 

The whole time the servers are arguing within clear earshot about how many rolls of silverware they need to roll each

Finally our server brings us our bill but she tells us she was mistaken and we can't actually use the coupon. We ask to speak to a manager, the manager just says he'll take care of it and we get our modified bill.

I went there with my travel companion, last evening, hoping to make it simple after a long day on the road. It was a disaster. The server, Satchel, was sweet, but could not properly speak. That is, he slurred his words terribly. He also kept on making lots of excuses when our food was not ready, some 45 minutes after we had ordered. We both ordered the ""Steak and Salad."" Simple enough, right?

My partner ordered a simple Manhattan from the bar. We had to keep on asking when that would appear. Finally, the order of gluten free fettucine with pesto arrived, and we split that. We had to keep begging the manager, Satchel and other servers to bring our dual ""Steak and Salad"" orders. Finally, when they did arrive, my steak was not cooked as I had wished. That's when I blew my cool. I left, as the manager was comping the meal, save but for the alcohol.

Please read the other reviews on this location should you think that I am being unfair or exaggerating. Most of the other reviews will support my experience.

Don't waste your time or cash here. There are MANY other choices if you're looking for fake Italian food. To be fair, the fettuccine with pesto sauce was plentiful and delicious. However, the negatives far outweigh the positives in this restaurant.

It wasn't busy and our waitress was inattentive.. Or maybe just poorly trained.  We had to ask for our waters and they were never refilled.  

I tried the mama's trio which was extremely disappointing.  The fettuccine Alfredo was the best thing on the plate (which is handedly the easiest thing to make), the chicken parmigiana was burnt and the lasagna was on par with Chef Boyardee [to be generous].

Right from the moment we walked in, hostess said it would only be a few minutes --no problem, EXCEPT that I counted at least a dozen empty tables & those were the ones I could actually see.   While waiting, the kitchen staff proceeded to slam pots & whatever else at a deafening sound to where we could not hear ourselves talk.  Do they not realize that they are open to the dining area?   

While being seated I commented to the hostess that the place seemed disorganized. She said they had a new manager who didn't know the routine yet AND they weren't expecting the winter visitors so soon. REALLY?   Are you stupid?  IT'S NOVEMBER???  I didn't need to hear this and found it unprofessional.   

We waited 10 min before anyone noticed us. A waiter came over and took drink orders, which we received quickly, but no sugar or silverware.  We were ready to order but could not get the waiter's attention.   I got up and found silverware and sugar on my own.   Finally, our orders were taken but no bread.    After 20 min I got up and went in search of the guy wearing a tie, who I presumed was the manager.  I told him ""20 min and no bread""!   He brought us some about 5 min later.   Our drinks were never refilled or even asked if we wanted them refilled!    

When dinners were served, waiter did not offer ground pepper or grated cheese.  I got up AGAIN, (at this point they may have thought I worked here), and tracked down a grated cheese caddy that had been left on a sideboard.   Now the waiter shows up to see if we wanted grated cheese!   

The meals were delicious but we had to contend with loud music which made it impossible to converse.  This is a ITALIAN restaurant --- why not play some pleasing Italian tenor music instead if something we would find at a club.  We were not planning on dancing on the table.  Again, no drink refills, even though our glasses were empty at this point.   

I could watch our waiter run to tables all over the restaurant which made no sense to me.   The wait staff did not look particularly happy and appeared instead like they were just racing through the motions to get through the night.   

We needed take home containers and waited another 15 min (at this point I was timing everything).  Finally, the waiter brought them and said they ran out of take-out containers and had to buy some at Pei Wei.   ?????   Is this supposed to be funny?   They were pitiful containers too.   

(SIGH).   We didn't want to take a chance of the waiter disappearing again so we asked for the bill at this time also.   

I guess the bill was also manufactured at Pei Wei.  Guess again --- another 15 min to get the bill and when the server brought it over, he brought new glasses of iced tea!!!!   At this point we thought it was just comical.  
Instead of waiting again, we tracked down the waiter to pay the bill.  

Could not get out if there fast enough.  We wished 'good luck' to everyone waiting to be seated (again, with lots of EMPTY tables). 

This location needs HELP FAST!  The GM needs to get his/her butt in here and TRAIN.  This experience seemed like a place that is on the verge of closing.  Don't they realize that there is tons of competition in DESERT RIDGE?  No one needs to put up with this."	2.0

I ordered the penne rustica pasta.  It was decent but lacked any depth.  The bruschetta appetizer was also decent however they gave me mostly burned bruschetta bread.

 rescued her...put the cork screw back in the bottle and removed the cork.  The entire time the server was apologizing that she never serves bottles of wine.   When I said it was not her fault .... she needed more training. ...she commented that her manager was mean and would probably yell at her for not being able to open the wine I told to have the manager talk to me.   I took pity on the poor untrained sweet server until she neglected to bring the salad we ordered before our entrees and then asked if we wanted it afterwards.  She stopped by seconds into our eating the entree and asked how it tasted then 5 minutes later brought us the check and told us no hurry....I'm still eating and she has already come back and asked if the check was ready. ...NO!

Sad to say, while the food was still good, the restaurant itself has gone way downhill.  The bathrooms were filthy and the service was abysmal.  In spite of mentioning to the staff multiple times that they forgot part of our order, we didn't receive the missing item until we were finished eating  Our waitress was in a daze, ignoring some of our requests (utensils, anyone?) and randomly bringing extra drinks to our table as we prepared to leave.

The bread is overwhelmed with rosemary and is not very good - disappointed again.  Makes those never ending garlic bread sticks at Olive Garden seem pretty scrumptious!

The mushroom ravioli I ordered was average and the spaghetti with meatballs was good but the portion size was very small for a price of $13.00.

Our server was Sydney, she was extremely unattentive, slow, and wasn't aware of the evenings soup or specials. We ordered a bottle of one of their nicer wines and we're served in water glasses. The manager Kelly informed us this was typical which would have been over looked however when we were served, Sydney complained that we could have normal glasses though the bartender would get upset at her for asking. Also, we were never offered another bottle or upsale. She also failed to remove the dishes from earlier courses, so when we received the dessert for the birthday boy that was supposed to be on the house  ( that still made it on to our bill ) the table hardly had any space for it. After our lack of service, and waiting for over 10 min to pay the iccorrect bill. One member of our party asked to speak with a manager, he waited at the host stand for a long while before Kelly appeared. She seemed unpleasant and upset to deal with a patron and when she went to adjust the dessert price she rolled her eyes at our table. Then quickly left the front of the house without an apology or handling the situation, instead left it up to the already slow and unenthused server to tend the bill.

I only gave it a star because it require me to rate it but I feel it deserves a half stare. After eating here I don't think I'll be back anytime soon. 

It started with a phone call. They said there was no wait. That should have been my first clue, for a Friday night rush. When we get there 3 mins later there is actually a 15 minuet wait. You cannot tell me that in 3 mins 4-5 tables came in all of a sudden. 

Then came the ordering. The waitress messed up my drinks, also had to ask for water 3 times before I got some. We ordered appetizers when we ordered drinks.  

Appetizers took an hour to get and 1:3 were cold and only a partial portion 3 tacos and not 4. 

At that point my table asked for a manager. The manager said it was a coaching experience for the waitress. Did not apologize and blames the computer for the issue. And rudely said (eye role heard in her voice about the partial appetizer comment) ""let me go get that last taco for you."" 

When our food was arriving the waitress said the potato would take about her 5 min. The person who got the potato said ""I don't want a potato microwaved"". I agree with her statement. If you go out you should not be getting a potato microwaved.   The steak was hard as a brick and the grilled veggies were solid half slabs not sliced and they were raw in the middle.  The waitress said there would be 4 grilled veggies and the woman only got two labs of squash and 3 red pepper slices. 

So the ""manager"" said ""I'll go back and get you another side"" in the most Obnoxious tone I've ever heard. I have no idea how she can be a manager. I feel like our waitress was more a manager than the actual manager even though she was slow.  As soon as she realized our irritation  she became more attentive. 

In the end we got one meal taken off which is the least they could do.

She did not check on us once, had a very nasty personality and was very rude and snippy to our entire group of 5 and a infant. As we watched all the other servers make rounds and smile and be kind, our waitress had a stone face and her personality sucked! in fact, she did not even tell us her name. I personally had a burger, and  the bun was very burnt and hard. my daughter did not like her meal at all, it was tasteless and bland. We waited 20 minutes to ask about our bill and a box for take home for the dogs. Today, I wake up throwing up with severe stomach pain. Horrible food and service.	1.0

The table Looks clean but when you put your hands on it . It'sticky...Eww!!

We were seated right away. Offered different places to sit. Not many people in restaurant. It was about 1145 am on Sunday morning.

We placed our orders 
person #1 French onion soup  & Ice Tea
person #2 Bacon Cheese burger  ( No onions ) with Fries and Ice Tea
Person #3  The Brunch Burger ( No Onions & No ketchup ) fries  & Pepsi
Person #4 Burger  ( No Cheese ) fries and Ice Tea

20-30 minutes go bye. We watch people walk in after after us and be serve their food before us and we're still waited for our food. 

When we were finally served we were not served all together.

Person #1 had to wait for no reason
Person #3 Fries were luke warm and egg shells in burger
Person #4 Burger had cheese  ( Even though they specifically asked for no cheese) fries luke warm.
Person #2 Burger was missing they were only given fries

7 minutes later the burger was brought out with NO Bacon.

The waitress accepted responsibility in the delay in our food.  How ever between missing the  bacon on the bacon cheese burger. The waitress said she was going to send the manager over so we could speak with him.  The manager Never came over and spoke with us.... so much for Customer Service. The waitress (christine) is not sole blame for bad service or food. I felt  ignored and purposely over looked by the manager Chris. Who had no problem stopping at other tables but ignoring ours. 

Instead the waitress gave us the bill for the food. Thankfully  minus the charge for person #2 burger.  How ever I still feel slighted or over looked because the manager never made an attempt to check on us or speak to us. The waitress apologized numerous times but her apologies didn't make the food come out any quicker, or stop the missing items. By the time she was attentive to our drink refills we were already upset and they took the path of ignoring us instead of facing the problem face on.

I don't write negative reviews on a regular basis so this is probably the worst one I've ever written. I will never visit this restaurant ever again I do not recommend it to anybody else.  Unless your in to being ignored, over looked or food being served to you not the way you order it!

So rather then throw a fit or demand to be seen and heard I brought my words and opinions here. I am not the type of person to not leave a tip. for $39.00 bill I left a $5.00 tip (Begrudgingly) But followed through by sharing my experience here on Yelp and Facebook."	2.0

Took server forever to get drink orders and just as long to get drinks. Appetizer came out cold. And server had food in their mouth while making sure they were warm enough. Food took way longer than should have to come out. Waited for server to pay she was no where to be found. Had to ask a server that was sitting up front on their phone where the host should have been to get our server still didn't come for a while and when they did they smelt of cigarettes and said they thought they showed us to pay on the device left on the table. When leaving host was coming inside from vehicle. Very disappointed used to be a favorite restaurant hadn't been in years won't be coming back.	0.0

My grandparents are in town and this is one of their favorites back home so we decided to stop in tonight. We were seated fast and the waiter came taking our drink orders right away.. He came back about 2 minutes later with our drinks..we were not ready to order a yet (group of 6) so he said he would come back soon and check with us again..it took him 15 minutes to come back and take our order..lucky my kids were playing with the tablet they had on the table and lost track of time.. He came and took our order and to my surprise he didn't write down one thing anyone said .. He just kept saying ""yes sir"" ""ok"" so at that moment I was a little worried if he was going to get everyone's order in correctly. We waited another 30 minutes for an order of Spanish dip and mozzarella sticks..which he never brought us any plates for. 25 minutes later half of us received our main dish. My grandfather ordered baked potato and was given fries.. He let him keep them and went and got him a potato. He said the kids meals and my husbands chicken and shrimp were coming.. We ask for another round of drinks.. He said he would be right back.. Another women came out with my husbands meal but didn't know about the kids orders.. We waited another 20 minutes for my kids food and our drinks to come. Everybody else was almost done with their food..They had chicken tenders and fries and a cheese pizza and fries. Of course it took another 15 minutes to flag him down for our check.. 75$ check I only left a 8$ tip.. Trust me I didn't want to leave that. But I will say the food we received was good.. We all did enjoy our food...just wish we could of enjoyed it together. This experience was a real big disappointment for my family.. We just wanted a nice evening with our grandparents and it turned in to a frustrating long night.

Service was impeccably slow, 45 minutes to get our entrees. Margarita tasted like the kind that comes in those Capri Sun like pouches.  Everything tastes as unfresh as it is.

As we first walked into this place the smell was not so good. I could not recall the smell but it was not that of a restaurant. 

We get our seat and look at the menu.  The waitress takes our order, and then goes on to explain we chose great meals. She wishes she could afford what we ordered. She also gave us a sense that she did not like her job. So I assume the pay at Applebee's is subpar, or her productivity is of the same level. As she walked away she looked to the hostess and said I need to smoke lets go. I'm sure the management does not have a clue of how bad you truly are. 

I ordered a medium steak, to my surprise I get a rare steak. My wife orders a medium well steak and gets a medium. This lets me know the chef has no idea what he is doing in the back and the training program is below par. I would have sent it back but this place looked to like one of them that you would get more than you asked for. 

As we go to pay, which now is a machine because the waitresses are so busy talking crap about everyone to take my payment. Anyway, they tried to charge me double on my drinks. The waitress went back to the manager 3 times before they finally took my credit card and manually ran it with the proper bill. 

I am completely unimpressed with this Applebee's. I also assume that this chain has fallen off the caring list. There is a lot of work that needs to be done. If you are looking for a nice dinner and good atmosphere please look elsewhere."	1.0

1393	fjvBTHjluJ_mo9BeHcHoBw	0.0	0.0	1.0	So I've eaten as this location several times over the past year and never had an issue until tonight. It appeared that our waitress was covering half of the tables by herself while the other 4 waitresses we saw shared the other half. This on top of having more than 1 table that didn't speak english, making it harder for her to take the orders, could have been alleviated with a better distribution of waitresses. It took us far to long to be served (not our waitresses fault) than it should have. Finding out that there were things on the menu that were no longer being sold was kind of a bummer but not the end of the world. We ordered an appetizer and the kitchen forgot to make it. My wife's salad looked like it had been sitting out waiting to be served since the morning and was missing a few of the normal components. My meal was fine but seemed to have been tossed together compared to usual. It seems like service and quality have gone down hill very quickly at this location and it should be addressed immediately. It's Applebees so I'm not expecting what I would at Ruth's Chris, but I always knew what I was getting and was never disappointed until tonight.	0.0

I ordered the three-cheese chicken penne with no tomatoes. The pasta wasn't very hot when it came out. There also wasn't a lot of chicken on it, which was fine with me, but others might find it to be skimpy. It tasted alright and I ended up eating it all... should have taken some for leftovers as the sauce is heavy. The garlic bread that came with it was not very good... it wasn't warm and tasted borderline stale. They really need to serve better garlic bread. We also got the chocolate chip cookie sundae for dessert. It was pretty good. But overall, not my favorite meal.	0.0

The nice commercial about the take two entres is very misleading. The nice juicy steak in the commercial is just a steak nugget, barely bigger than my thumb! 
For that price you also get a wedge of iceberg lettuce which amounts to 1/8 of a small head of lettuce.
Strangely the ""meal"" is delicious but what exactly on the plate was worth $10.99??
By the way, if you want a real second entre, the price is $11.99.
Was the excess charge for the skillful way the cook kept the nugget from falling through the grill? Maybe it was for the extra char on the nugget? Or maybe the 4 leaves of raw spinach under the nugget?

My husband, brother and I came in on a Wednesday night at about 10:45.
There were only a few other guests there, mostly sitting at the bar.
We were sat quickly and the waitress took our drink orders, she came back quickly to take our meal orders.
My husband got the Standard Burger, the waitress asked him ""Pink or No Pink"" to which my husband responded ""No Pink"" and even followed up with ""Well Done"".
Personally, I would think that meant he wanted the burger cooked all the way through.
We got our food out and my husband cuts his burger in half... Low and behold the burger is pink throughout. 
We call the waitress over to the table, show her the burger and remind her that he asked for well done. She responds with, ""it's only a little pink, but I can put it back on the grill.""
My husband verifies that she plans on putting a but in half burger back on the grill, with all of the sauce and cheese already on it... 
She then says, ""oh, you want a new one... Okay."" 
Meanwhile, my brother and I have our food and are done eating.
The manager brings his new burger out to us and explains that we will not be charged for the burger, we ask for it to go and the manager has an attitude about it and walks away while my husband is APOLOGIZING to him for the extra task! (If the food was cooked the correct way in the first place this would have been a non-issue)

We came in after the baseball game at 4pm ordered right away, the waitress was attentive in welcoming us and getting our order. After that it all went downhill very quick, an hour wait still no food we ask what's the issue and they say should be coming out soon. We wait another 30 min and part of the food comes out cold, still where missing 4 people including my kids food, the waitress comes over informed us that they lost our ticket which is why it took so long for our order to come out. We request to speak to the manager and inform him the food is cold and on top of that it's not complete. We finally got the rest of our order and thankfully my kids food was warm but our friends nachos where a joke zero cheese and meet. After 2 hours we again talk to the manager tell him this was unacceptable he did apologize and say he would take some of the items off our bill which I was thankful for, however he leaves with our tickets doesn't come back. We get the server to see what's going on since we just want to get out at that point, she brings us the check only to find since we split it the discount was gone, again get the manager involved and says I'll fix it now at 2.5 hours here we get our ticket to pay. What an extremely poor managed place, the manager apologized said he messed up on 4 other orders as well which I don't care I just wanted to get out and leave. The funny thing is he got into an argument with a customer who wanted to watch a show on the tv and told him there's a dennys down the road super rude of that comment.

The Hooters girls were very nice although a bit forgetful, on both occasions. Also, they seem a bit confused as to who's table is who's. Then there's an awkward moment when they're both standing at the table ready to take our order. This happened both times I was there, kinda uncomfortable. 
Also, I understand their shtick is to have pretty girls waiting on you, but when their hair is long and flowing everywhere, especially when they're playing with it while working, it's not very sanitary. They should maybe have pony tails or have it pinned back somehow no? 

The food. The wings are just ok...in my opinion they're not a as fresh as other Hooters restaurants. Also, the fries were stale, like they had been sitting there for days and the cook nuked them in the micro for a minute before serving! Also, I order 10 wings and when they arrived the waitress stated that she owes me 3 because 3 fell on the ground. I never saw those wings...not surprised.

Anyways, i picked up my wings and they had no sauce and so i asked for sauce and she gave me a side of what looked like vomit. It looked as if the sauce broke or something. It was curdled almost. I dunno, but with another wing place right across the street, I'd tighten that situation up. Ew...just grosses me out to even think they would serve someone that.....crap.	0.0

However, the service was very poor at this location for our visit on Friday 10/04.  The waitress was rude, delayed placing our order, and did not check on our table during the meal.  Most of all, it was very disappointing when we had to return 2 minutes after we left because a member of our party left his wallet at the table.  The table was not bussed yet when we returned but the check was picked up.  Since the wallet was not where he left it, we asked the waitress who claimed she did not notice a wallet.  As soon as we asked to see the manager, she returned with the wallet instead.  Very disappointing as our perception is that she intended to keep if had we not asked to see the manager.	0.0

PROS: Clean facility, presents a visually positive image. Excellent service, by a relatively new server (according to her), Emmy. She provided truly ""Emmy Award Winning Service!"" My suggestion to her: Keep doing exactly what you are doing. Friendly, and most importantly, good communication (about the CON, which follows below). Also great: Manager Jenny. Found out she was leaving. What a loss for Hooters. Should have given her a raise or done whatever it would have taken to keep her around. She is professional, honest, friendly...and seemed to have a good relationship with the staff.

CON: To my knowledge, Hooters was founded mostly on the premise of cooking great tasting wings with beer, which are served by scantily clad, sexy women. However, on all-you-can eat Wednesdays, there is a major problem...at least at this particular facility. The traffic was light to moderate...nothing past 1/2 - 2/3 capacity...at the absolute MOST...and only for a brief time frame of less than an hour....at the busiest part of the evening. Arrived around 7-ish, if memory serves, and stayed til about 10ish. From what our party of three learned, apparently their deep-fry equipment cannot handle heavy demand. ""Heavy demand"" apparently means a restaurant about 1/2 full at most, with most guests ordering the wing special. Re-orders were delayed well past reasonable (20 - 30 minutes at the very least). A server other than Emmy brought us a partial wing order at one point (literally 3 - 4 wings each) because we had been waiting so long...and we waited even longer for the rest of our first reorder to be cooked. When they arrived, they were barely cooked...not crisp at all. We were told that they have limited deep-fry cooking pots, and the excess demand for wings on a night like that causes more cold/frozen wings to be put in the oil, which in turn cools the oil and lengthens the cook time. The problem just spirals out of control, the busier it gets.

Bottom line: You are a restaurant and sports bar. Your main job is to provide a basic food menu. If you do not have the equipment to handle a 1/2 capacity customer load, then stop advertising ""all you can eat.""  I hate to imagine the fiasco that would result if it had been busier. I saw AT LEAST 3 parties leaving...and was told they left because of the over-taxed wing cooking process. They simply did not want to continue waiting, and I don't blame them at all. I love Hooters. I don't go there weekly, but I have been a customer who has for more then 20 years enjoyed my visits and the wings. But given my experience this time at this location, I would have to re-evaluate whether I would really visit again..on all you can eat night. My advice: At the very least, do yourself a favor and pick a different day of the week. That way, your wings will be cooked thoroughly and you will not have to wait 30 minutes for your order to arrive.

We had a table of 7 people and our service was extremely slow.  My wings were good as usual, however the onion rings were cold (like they were sitting out waiting for the wings to be done).  Another person in our party had to have their boneless wings returned because they came out cold also. The manager did come out to replace the boneless wings & apologize for the problem.  But our service there just fell flat.  We all wished we had decided to go to Buffalo Wild Wings which is right across the street.

It's impressive when you walk in (compared to the dated carnival that is Casino Arizona) modern, open, good amount of seating and beautiful open air patio with sliding glass doors. That's about where the good ends. I had a party of 15. I'm not sure if our server was the ONLY server in the entire restaurant or ????? Our drinks took forever to get. So much so that half of our party ended up just go directly to the bar, rather then wait for her. The table across from us went and spoke to the manager regarding their nonexistent server.. right behind her my husband had a word with him as well. All that did was give our server a pissy attitude. AWESOME!! Perfect Birthday party. 

The appetizers were really good. We tried 1 chicken & 1 steak quesadilla and a couple steak skewers. Food was super tasty! Drinks were terrible -- WEAK. I thought maybe it was just mine, so I had my friend (that's a non-drinker) try my vodka tonic and she said it tasted like.. TONIC -- FROM A NON DRINKER?! The entire table said their mixed drinks were terrible. We all decided to go into the casino and find a bartender that would pour a decent drink. 

The topper -- We all closed our tabs and left. Later that night one of my friends mentioned that a 15% tip was already included in everyone's bill.... Wait WHAT? WE ALL TIPPED HER DOUBLE because we didn't read the receipt ((we just wanted to LEAVE)).

I had a choice between Taberna or Wendy's and I'm really regretting not choosing Wendy's. My experience at Taberna was not that pleasant from the start. After finding a table, as this restaurant is a seat-yourself kind of place, I had to wait a considerable time before being acknowledged by a waitress and given a menu. The menu was kinda crusty having been scooped from off the ground before being placed on my table. I ordered a water while I looked over the menu. That water tasted kinda ...bad. So I didn't drink it. I asked the server a few questions about my order and was given an explanation of a few ingredients used in the item I was interested in. I placed an order for chicken and nachos. On the menu it lists it coming with 'Mexican queso' - also sour cream, a cheese crumble, pico de gallo, and pickled onions - and spicy smoked chicken or what have you. I requested to 86 the pico and onions. Leaving it only being chicken, queso, cheese crumble, and sour cream. What I got was, hastily dropped off mind you, ... what looked like slices of American cheese melted onto the tortilla chips, white cheese crumble dusted in the center, considerable amount of sour cream and lots of strips of this smoked chicken. It didn't seem right. Queso is not melted yellow cheese. Maybe it was a mistake. I asked my server about it and she said ""oh that is how it comes"" I responded, ""... I thought it had queso sauce."" And was told ""that's what the white cheese sprinkled on top is"" after she had just previously told me from the list of ingredients that ""queso fresco"" was the cheese crumble. I wanted to clarify - ""so is the side of queso you can order for $4 just a cup of cheese crumble?"" And finally she admitted ""that's the queso sauce. We are out of that."" Getting the picture now I asked her, ""so that's why this cheese is on here instead? It's suppose to have the queso you're out of?"" And she said yes, but then told me ""that's the new way we make it. We always made it like this before."" And pointed at my food. She seemed upset at me for some reason. I was not rude or hateful. I simply wanted to know why I got what I got. She said, somewhat flustered, ""you want something else? You can order something else. I'll just take this off."" And I said that I would just try to eat this. And try I did. 
The chips were basically cemented together with the layers of melted yellow cheese. I barely could pry a chip apart to get a bite. I thought to myself that if all else fails, I could just eat the chicken. That should be good. Right?
Wrong. The chicken that was used in this dish tasted almost exactly like the little fajita chicken strips you get ""cooked and ready"" from a bag in the premade mashed potatoes and macaroni isle in the grocery store. The texture was awful. The flavor was so weird tasting. I can barely describe it. Just. Not good. I did try to eat as much of this as I could since I was prepared to bite the bullet and pay the $13 for my dinner. I slid the plate away, hoping the waitress would get the signal that I was finished. At this point the dining area became crowded and my server did not make it around to me for quite a while. She would run past me a few times and not even glance at me. The table next to me got up and she approached them and asked if they needed their check. Then she quickly went off to take care of them, so I followed suit. Stood up and after another few minutes of rushing, she came back by and, with a bit of slinging, handed me my receipt. I was only charged for the soda I ordered to offset the gross water. I approached her about it and said I could pay for the nachos too, but she stared at me and said I shouldn't pay for something I wasn't happy with. I guess that's fair. That was not my intent but I didn't want to irritate her further. Paid and went on. I ended up grabbing a deli sandwich from a food kiosk on the way to my flight. Very disappointed in the kind of experience I had at Taberna. The server seemed to be under a lot of pressure, which I definitely understand, but she was not friendly or empathetic at all."	0.0

No hint of taquilla or lime. As a matter of fact, they couldn't be bothered with salt or pepper either, it was literally straight out of a can. The salsa was store bought so at least that has some flavor. The black beans and rice that came with the tacos were pretty bad too.

Upon further inspection, it seems to me that although they advertise as being healthy (and generally are), almost all of their meals are high in fat content. And since they don't allow you to ""Create Your Own"" anything, there's only so much you can do to fix that. Now on to my experience...

Employee seemed uninterested in me until the last second. When I gave my order, I was spoken to in a clipped way that made me feel like she didn't care, or just wanted to get it over with. I don't need any special service, but it was a bit off-putting.

Asked for kale instead of spinach/romaine. Paid extra for said kale. Still got spinach/romaine (I got it as take-out so didn't notice until I was at my later destination).

Asked for no dressing. It was SMOTHERED in dressing, so much so that most of my salad was soggy by the time I got to eat it. 

No, this place isn't terrible. It's fine. But the customer service and menu versatility seems to be seriously lacking. I have dropped my review from 3 to 2 stars because of my combined experiences.


ORIGINAL REVIEW:


Tried this place post workout between classes because I wanted a healthier option.

There was another girl having problems with her order because she wanted a smaller portion (the portions are pretty huge, I will admit). One of the employees told her that the wrap was a smaller portion, so she asked for the wrap without a tortilla. The other employee couldn't get it through her head that that wasn't to be rung up as a salad. In the end, the first employee ended up giving her the smaller salad as a ""wrap,"" but it was a lot of grief over something pretty simple. 

I like that they have healthy options. It's weird that they have everything set up like a health-food Chipotle, but they don't let you just customize whatever you want - you have to pick something off the menu and then you can switch a couple things around if you wanna have the conversation with them about it. There are a lot of proteins and ""superfoods,' like kale, that you can add for like a dollar. I did that, but I have to say, $8.47 is a little on the pricy side for a salad, even if it was pretty big. I asked for dressing on the side and there was still dressing put on the salad. Oh well. I'm not really a big complainer, and it was good-tasting dressing anyways

They shake up the salads for you, which I actually kind of liked because I hate it when all the toppings are gone in the first few bites. It was a good salad, the superbiotic one. I was more or less satisfied.

Oh, and they take M&G. So I'll probably be back."	1.0

It was a Monday night just to add as anyone can imagine it was very slow. There were only two of us. Had us waiting for 25 minutes for a simple hotdog with fries. We drive off only to realize the bun to the hotdog was as hard as a rock. Decided to go back for a refund at this point given the wait time and the poor choice of bun. The pregnant hillbilly looking bucktooth broad didn't even apologize because it was our fault for ""rushing"" her. In her exact words, ""the bun wouldn't have been hard had you guys not been rushing us."" First, we weren't rushing, we simply asked how much longer it would take after 15 minutes. She gave us our refund of course. Seeing as she wasn't at least courteous about the poor food, she didn't say anything at all. My mother walked out and I stayed in to ask for a manger. Without her realizing I stayed inside, she complained out loud to the cook that the bun wasn't hard, half of the dog was eaten, and she didn't care about it. I stood behind the counter with a smirk and said, ""is your manger in?"" Her voice began to shake, very nervous, dropped the pen after I asked her to give me the number to the manager, didn't make any logic.

Courtney the young lady who answered the phone told us that there is no way to prove we ordered it a different way. Not very good customer service if you ask me. Oh! And the manager was busy and refused to come to the phone to try and help. I am extremely offended at the fact they basically called me a liar and said that we ordered our food wrong that they didn't get it wrong. Very rude, unfriendly service.

First, they were not ready with the food when the driver got there so we got the food 20 minutes later than expected.  Then they forgot one of the meals which made us waste more time figuring out how to split what we did receive.   Now onto the food.   For the price it was not acceptable.  The portion sizes are small for pastas they say they feed 2.  And the taste was ok at best.  This restaurant is going on our never again list between making it more difficult when we needed an easy night and the actual food.	0.0

They seem to think that fettuccine alfredo and carbonara use the same sauce but they are not. The sauces taste like they use flour in them which is not how these sauces are made. The lasagna is pasta noodles, ricotta, mozzarella and red sauce. Sure you can make a lasagna like that but you better use great herbs and spices which they don't so it is very bland and uninspired. Last nights salad had plenty of brown lettuce, not very pleasing to look at or eat if you happen to miss removing it. 

I read one review that stated the original owners had sold the restaurant and the quality of the food has gone down hill. A common mistake by new owners.....to bad.

Talking to the guy at the register was like talking to a brick wall. He had his headphones in and wasn't paying attention. Nobody in this restaurant wanted to be here. Customer service is awful, it's almost like they didn't want us to be in here. I love Rosati's and this is my first time at this location. I usually go to the one on 59th and Union Hills which has exceptional service and employees. This is my first and last time at this location because it is awful.

Now it's owned by people who don't  know what's on their own menu or the names that coincide with each dish. The food used to be pretty amazing, but now it is underwhelming and hardly deserving of being described as mediocre. I took a friend there not realizing things had changed, but thought I'd give it a try anyway. I could have gotten better white sauce out of a jar. Had I realized how bad their food was, I would have. Their cheesy breadsticks are simply a frozen breadstick baked with a string cheese in the middle. Those were good, but hardly worth the price. And it took FOREVER to get our food (it was a to go order). Utterly disappointing. The restaurant was clean and the people were not rude, but that's about the only positive thing that can be said.	3.0

Ever since the new ownership, the food has gone downhill. The salads are brown and wilted, the staff gets confused when you order something custom, they often forget parts of your order for delivery and the last two times our pizza looked like it was stored on its side.

Ordered a pizza last night at 8:20pm. Was told it would be ready in 30 minutes. Since we live nearby, we leave at the 30 min mark. Last time, it took 10-15 min longer than expected, so we decided to give it a little extra time. 

We arrive at 8:55pm. The one person in the front tells us the pizza ""isn't ready yet, but will be ready soon."" Now, to be fair, it's Friday night. It's almost 9pm. But there isn't a soul in the store and the phone is barely ringing. So we assume, okay, take a seat, she'll let us know. 3 or 4 other employees make it out to the front, answering the phones, etc. But no one even looks at us. The only two people in the store.

We sit for another 15 min, my eyes glued to the pizza warmer - no new pizzas have arrived, nothing new waiting for patient customers. We ordered a pizza, an order of cheese breadsticks, and a few cookies - and still 30 minutes later we haven't heard a thing. Did they forget about us? The girl on the phone DID seem busy - she'd been calling all the recent take out customers to tell them they are out of what they'd ordered - but come on,  30 min?

So finally I had to ask. Of course, they'd been sitting in the warmer SINCE WE'D ARRIVED, some 30 minutes ago. Clearly angry we'd been waiting for so long, and our tasty, fresh Rosati's pizza now reduced to stale, gooey mess, the girl can only muster a ""sorry"" and an ""enjoy your pizza"".

Which we didn't, because, OF COURSE, it. wasn't. even. the. right. pizza.

 Sure, it was ""close"", but when you order a pizza, and speak with an actual human being, you figure at least you'll get the right pizza. Sure, it might take an hour, but still...  And when you spend $35 on the wrong pizza you had to wait an hour for, dry breadsticks and uncooked cookies, well, I stew all night and get up to rate you on Yelp.

Never again.

It ended up with us leaving the disgusting excuse for a Chicago style pizza on the front porch for the driver to pick back up for a full refund. When I called, the woman I spoke to informed me she was the owner and unfortunately she had zero customer service skills and didn't seem to care that we were disappointed with their subpar food. It was plainly obvious she was super annoyed to be getting any feedback and rather than try to make it right, she got defensive as if I haven't tried and been impressed with SEVERAL other locations.

So my Girlfriend and i got ready and we went to go pick our food at this point i was not angry at all i totally know how it is to be short staffed at work. Once we arrived we where not greeted for about 10 min when we talked to the girl that called us I informed her that we where here to pickup our food she walked into the back, and stayed back there for about another ten min and when she came but up front she told us our food was going to take another 30 min. so my girlfriend and i sat down and were waiting for our food there was at least 5 people working there just standing around they where not busy at all and could have totally delivered our food not to mention every other word out of there mouth was a curse word, like really we are right here we can hear everything you are saying. We finely got our food and left. On the second occasion we placed an order online. the same girl called us about 15 min after we ordered our food she told us that there fryer was going to be down for 20 to 30 min and she just wanted to let us know its going to be about an hour before we got our food i told here that it was fine we will be able to wait. About 2 hours later I called her back to see where my food was and she told me it was out for delivery. Another hour goes by and still no food. So now its been about 3 hours total she called me and told me there fryer is still down and it would be about another hour. There is no way i am waiting another hour for chicken strips and mozzarella sticks, come on really. I told her we placed the order over 3 hours ago and you told me it was out for delivery already but now your fryer is down i have no idea how that is possible. I told her i am not waiting 4 hours total for this and that she needed to refund us and   we dont even want the order anymore.

The last 3 times we have ordered delivery they got the order wrong.  Recently I ordered an italian beef with red sauce and cheese and green peppers as well as hot wings.  Instead I received plain chicken fingers and a plain italian beef.  When I called them back they said they would be sending a driver to pick up the incorrect food (seriously, you're going to take back food that you're just going to throw away anyway?) and that the reason the order was wrong was because there was a New Cook. And I received no apology.  (Rosati's are you for real?) Then it took them another hour and a half to send me the correct order.  Something about the italian beef tasted ""off"".  It had a weird taste and it gave me digestive problems later.  A few months ago, my sister-in-law ordered from here and they got her pizza wrong, then it took them 2 hours to bring her the correct pizza, and only because she called them back wondering what had happened.  So it took this place 3 hours to deliver the correct pizza.  When she asked what happened they told her they were short on drivers and had forgotten about her order.  They still charged her and no apologies.  Every other time we order pasta from here they end up getting the order wrong."	1.0

He said he could send out another set of wings, but that would have arrived well after the party was over and would not have accomplished anything.

I called the store again, only to be told they would send a new pizza but I would have to pay the delivery fee. I explained I wasn't paying the delivery fee for a mistake they made. The employee then said I could talk to the manager so I spoke to Dillon the manager, who explained that in would have to pay the delivery fee and he couldn't seem to understand why I didn't want to pay for their mistake. I then just told him to refund me my money and forget about the pizza, I asked for a confirmation email to be sent that then refund had gone through.

We went in on a Saturday night, slightly expecting to have to wait to be seated.  But that wasn't the case!

It took 20 minutes for our nachos to come out, and you could tell they had run out of tomatoes and jalapenos, because they were fresh, like from the grocery store, while the rest of the toppings had obviously spent a week or two in the fridge.  Then, it took another 15 minutes for our wings to come out.  Not only were they over cooked, but the seasoning on them was scarce!  My lemon pepper wings didn't have enough seasoning to cover even 1/3 of the amount of wings that were in the tray, let alone all of them!  And the Blue Moon BBQ sauce tastes like garbage, don't waste your time!  And the worst part of the night was the carrots and celery they gave me!!

When we arrived at the restaurant, which is a nice, large location, many tables had dirty dishes stacked on them. Two two of us were immediately taken to a table, which I thought was good because the place was relatively empty. Maybe only 25% of tables were occupied. But when we got to the table the host told us, ""Wait. Hold on."" He picked up the tab from the previous customers from the table and cleared the rest of the trash. Then he motioned for us to sit. Before we could, however, he stepped in front of us and said he needed to wipe it down first. We stood there awkwardly and watched him clean the table and booth seats. At least something was being cleaned in that place.

We sat and looked over the menu for more than fifteen minutes before ever being greeted by a server. She came by and said, ""Do you want drinks?"" Because the service had been so nonexistent already, we opted to stick with waters. She came back almost ten minutes later, quickly put the waters on the table, and left without saying a word. Because we had been sitting there for the better half of an hour, we were ready to order. But no one would acknowledge out existence. The manager and several servers were just chilling at the host counter watching the TVs and socializing. There were almost as many employees in the place as there were patrons, but the entire staff moved around like they were walking through molasses and every table of people seemed frustrated.

When we had been sitting for forty-five minutes without ever being addressed, we decided to get up and leave. We left our waters on the table and handed our menus back to the manager at the host counter. We explained to him the problem we experienced and said we would probably just get food to go. He brushed us off and gave a half-hearted apology as he pointed to the to-go counter nearby. Total lack on concern or care.

We got some food to go and it was decent enough. Definitely NOT worth the hassle.

My husband, his co-worker and I stopped in for lunch about a month ago.  We all placed our orders at the same time, however, our food came out at different times.  I ordered a salad while my husband and his co-worker each ordered the wing/fries lunch combo.  My husband's co-worker's order came out in about 10 minutes, my salad came out about 10 minutes after and my husband's about 15 minutes after that... Ridiculous much? When our server brought out the second plate, even HE was surprised that we were still waiting on my husband's plate. He let us know that he had checked the time our orders were logged in and it had definitely been over 30 minutes.  He said he would notify the manager and have him come over to talk to us.  About 40 minutes into our meal, the manager comes over, says that he was made aware of the situation and then walked away... THAT'S IT. Seriously, that's it. No apologies, nothing... but we decided to let it go.

Yesterday we decided to give it another shot... horrible, horrible mistake.  We  placed our order and about 5 minutes later our wings come out - GREAT!  Needless to say, I was  extremely surprised so I asked the server if it was the correct table and he grabbed the basket of wings and said he would check.  He left and came back about 2 minutes later and confirmed that it was the right order, or so he tried to make us believe it was.  We had ordered the ""wild"" sauce and that is what the sticker read, which would have been right, but underneath that sticker was another one that read ""hot"".  Same wings as earlier before with different sticker? Most likely.  We had just gotten back from Flagstaff and were extremely hungry so we decided to let it go... again.  And this is how the rest went: The wings were cold and stale, our server forgot our plates, then the server forgot our fries and then he forgot the ketchup.  Oh, and my husband's beer came out about 15 minutes after it was ordered... NEEDLESS TO SAY, WE ARE VERY OVER THIS PLACE.  The wings are mediocre and the service is poor."	0.0

The first impression was noticing table top accoutrements piled on the floor next to the door that led to our patio seating. The carpeted floor was dirty and certainly not a place you would want to stack items to be used by your customers. We stood at the patio for a brief second before we changed our minds to eat indoors because the patio tables were scattered and the patio felt rundown. After being seated inside the one and only highlight of the evening was our server. I believe his name was Samuel. He was very nice and did his best to give us good service but voluntarily apologized multiple times that our two dinners were taking so long to prepare. In fairness, there was a major basketball game being played that evening and the place was very crowded but still, the delay was unreasonably long. When the meals arrived, the carrots and celery were limp and a long long way from fresh.  One basket of wings appeared to have been sitting under a heat lamp for quite a while as the barbecue sauce on top had already thickened. The chicken in the other basket appeared to be freezer burned.  The appearance of the food was off putting and nothing tasted fresh. This is not a place I would recommend.	0.0

Somehow spending almost 50$ is not enough of a profit for this business to provide celery or dipping sauce to customers. 

Empty restaurant with 7 customers , 50 televisions on wasting electricity and wasteful expenses that can be spent on customers that are regulars with dining at this wing establishment. Wing stop has much better customer service and provide a warm and welcoming environment and food service for their patrons. 

Employees at this location seem bothered by customers, do not offer any type of positive customer service but rather treat customers like they are a burden.

The food in Philly was pretty good for a sports themed restaurant. Unfortunately, it is not nearly as good here in Scottsdale. My wife and I decided to stop in and watch the World Cup and have lunch. The quality of the television picture was good the food not so much. We ordered the Ultimate Nachos with chicken and an order of fries. The server asked if we wanted the one pound or three pound basket of fries. I said one pound is more than enough. Again, you just can't assume things. The food came and the fries were in a small cardboard tray. If they were a pound, I am going to be the next King of England. Now on to the nachos. The chicken which there wasn't much of was small colorless tasteless pieces sparsely spread on top of the chips. The chips had some cheese on top and very little to none on the chips toward the bottom of the dish. There was no chili to be found. After a taste or two each we sent the nachos back. We asked for our check as we didn't feel like doing any further sampling of this location's menu. We came, we sampled, we won't be back.	2.0

Our party of six stood at the front for nearly ten minutes (the place had a few tables, but wasn't in a full-tilt lunch rush, yet.) before a server noticed us and led us to a table. 

We put in our orders and then waited... and waited... While the place filled up with a typical Scottsdale lunch crowd.

How long does it take to make wings and fries? I actually know, from working in restaurants back in college. I takes about eight minutes, from fryer to plate. 

The plates hit the table at about five after noon. The company I work for has an hour lunch. We ended up staying and eating, but everyone was late getting back, and we were all thoroughly annoyed. However, because a manager knocked 50% off our tabs for the inconvenience, and the wings (when they appeared) were actually decent, I didn't enter a negative review at that time.

So... I forgot all about it, until today. One of my co-workers noticed that  his bank was charged more than he signed for at that lunch. Not a lot - but wtf?

I ordered the garden crasher, it comes out with no hummus, no carrots or celery, and about 2 slices of lousy cucumbers, then the pita chips. I had to ask for all of my missing items , which being in the industry for 10 years, that dish should have not even left the kitchen missing that much! The server didn't even acknowledge the dishes lack of  items and then proceeded to return to tell me that they are out of hummus. He asked if I wanted to order something else so I got the naked tenders with a veggie boat, and he took away the lacking dish. He brought out the veggie boat, and about 15 mins go by with no tenders. My party was completely done eating when mine new dish came out. The naked tenders were terrible! I tried to suck it up and like them and not complain again, but I just couldn't do it. They were slimy and had a rubbery appearance and tasted gosh awful. Finally after 3 bites I couldn't do it anymore and informed the server. The server was very apologetic but the visit was an honest and complete fail. I left still hungry, and not one manager even came to apologize. It was a Saturday morning around 1130/12 pm so it was not even busy. Upon leaving we were not even said goodbye to and there were about 3 or 4 employees up front.

I've not been to one of these famous wing places in the past as it's never been close but let's venture out to celebrate!
Let me say I will never go back. We ordered medium buffalo wings- 3 of the 9 that came in the order had any sauce on them at all. The other 6 were blank. So we asked for a side of sauce.  I ordered the build your own burger-  with everything + mayo.  No mayo. Burgers are apparently served dry like the wings.  So we also asked for the mayo at the same time as wing sauce.  We then watched our server take an order, cash out a table and bus a table.  13 minutes later she realized she had forgotten our condiments and she walked back to the kitchen and got them.  I ate one bite on my bet cold burger (no mustard either) and we ate 5 of the 9 cold wings. When she finally checked back on us it was with the check and offered no boxes and did not inquire once about the food.

This is the first day of the NCAA games, with multiple games playing at one time, every TV, or at least the majority, should be on these games. We live in Arizona and the Arizona Wildcats tipped off tonight, the Main TV should be up and ready to play this game, after multiple attempts with all TVs shutting on and off they barley got the game on in time for the patrons to watch, after many boos from your BWW guest they got the game up right before tip off. We also ordered chips and queso and after 3 attempts had to send it back, the queso was cold each time, the waitress even stuck her finger in it to confirm. I'm giving this 2 stars because our waitress Alyssa has been trying to make the best out of a crappy restaurant and running around making her tables happy, which I appreciate. I would give her more stars but this experience just doesn't deserve it. A fun night out celebrating the NCAA tourney and Arizonas team in the big game has been ruined and it's very disappointing.	0.0

Our server was lovely and kept our drinks filled but that was about the only positive part of our meal. I ordered the street tacos like I do at my local bww but for whatever reason here they cooked my tortilla until it was basically a chip, my chicken was completely chard, and the pico was extremely scarce. I ordered 4 traditional wings which just kind fell flat. They were super fatty and over cooked and just overall disappointing.	1.0

The rest of the wings were pricey. Around $6 for 5 wings? Really? Yes I know you have sauces (let me tell it's pretty mediocre) and you have the giant TVs but I can't really seeing myself paying for that much for wings.

I would go there for the $3 menu and 60 cent boneless if you are into the boneless stuff. Go somewhere else for tastier and cheaper wings."	3.0

BUT... the last 2-3 times of visiting this unit, well it's actually been horrible. And it's too bad, cause we like BWW in most locations. But this franchise needs help...soon. We came in at 9pm tonight, had to patiently wait for a total of 10 minutes to be seated while our eventual server walked away after we had waited 4 minutes to be acknowledged, to sweep the floor in a section where there were no customers while ""visiting"" with another employee.  Actually, there were only 4 small paries seated in the restaurant. Then she came back & finally seated us, nonchalantly apologizing for the wait. She wanted to take our entire order as she seated us, but we didn't know what we wanted, except for our drinks. Then she disappeared only to return to the 3 top seated behind us...visiting with the young patrons there, as if she knew them. When my wife decided to get up to go to the ladies room, she finally came over to take our order but said she'd return when my wife returned. I said no,  I can order for both of us and did. I ordered the ""snack"" size boneless wings with honey BBQ. My wife's wrap came out okay but my order of 8 boneless wings came out as 6 and labeled as ""1/2 small"" with 6 pieces, not 8 and they were mostly very dry, with little sauce, mostly bare breading showing. She finally came back & I asked her about it. She did get me some sauce & 2 more pieces. I don't usually leave a negative comment on a restaurant's performance but felt compelled after seeing so many employees, lack of patrons and lack of customer service.  Something needs to be done to save BWW's reputation and this franchise... one visit with bad service/food is one thing...3 times is a sign of poor management and/or employees that don't have a clue or care. We hope someone will fix this one and soon...Good Luck!"	1.0

So decided to take the kids tonite cuz they have been asking to go. We walked in and they are showing the UFC fights. But the place was surprisingly empty in my opinion. Lots of empty tables. We got seated quickly and my boys knew to ask for a tablet. Good thing too cuz it was over 30 minutes to get our meal. I was busy on my phone so between the fight and my yeeps i didn't notice. But my boys woulda been climbing the walls if we didn't have the tablets. Anyway. I ordered a prime rib salad and my kids ordered medium wings & mac n cheese. I was expecting a nice rare prime rib sliced thin on a nice fresh bed of romaine tomato salad. Unfortunately thats not what i got. The prime rib tasted & looked like bacon!  Not what i wanted. It was dry and salty! Prime rib shouldn't taste like that! The salad was just plain kinda dry bag salad. Nothing to write home about. The kids said the medium boneless wings were too spicy and i agree. The mac & cheese looked decent but served in a small take out cup. Small portion. Our server Matt was decent. The wait was excessive for the crowd tonite. The bathroom was a bit grungy too but i think the restaurant really isnt too busy. I doubt I'll be back here with so many other wing choices out here in Phx.	8.0

We had to flag down a host for someone to come to our table. Other tables around us were seated, placed drink and food orders and we still were not acknowledged. The waiter was very short and he didn't tend to our table at all. We had to flag down other waiters to fill out water. By the time we got our food, we were already irritated and the food was cold and didn't even taste that great. Other tables around us were disgusting and had not been bussed the entire time we were there. Buffalo wild wings lost some long time customers. We will NOT be returning.	0.0

We ordered a couple of beers and took about 10-15 minutes to get them to our table. Then we ordered the snack size wings for me and the buffalo grilled cheese for my husband. When we got our food (which took longer than should have for only being about 5 tables in the entire restaurant) I noticed that I only had 4 wings in my basket when the menu specifically says ""at least 5"" for the snack size. So I asked the server politely about it, because I understand it's not always the servers fault. He responded saying ""on really? Well the number changes every week.""... Then why does your menu say ""at least 5""? He then told me he would get me another one. As for my husbands food, it was cold right off the bat, and only had a few small pieces of chicken. Time went by and we finished eating what we had. Our server brought our bill and I never did receive that last wing. Pretty disappointing service for being his only table. I can only image what he's like with a full section. I wouldn't have minded if he had just told me that they were out of wings for the night (if that were the case) by laziness doesn't fly in my book.

What gets me is when we got up to leave of the 5 tables 3 were partially bussed and 2 remained untouched).  The establishment didn't look 1/2 full and eating while being surrounded by dirty tables didn't make a pleasant experience.  In addition the floor areas appeared dirty and unkept (napkins on floor which appeared to not being taken care of).

I give an extra star as the server did a good job at serving us (I wonder if that person was thinking job hunting sites..).

And if they specialize in wings, wouldn't you think they should be amazing?  Wrong.  These were the worst wings I ever had, and I mean ever.  They were tough, not crispy and overall scary to eat.  Plus on an order of 10, they brought us 8.  They never said anything, and 15 minutes later, brought us another 2.  We waited nearly 20 minutes for these lousy wings, yet when I returned a couple of mine that were inedible, new ones were brought out only minutes later, so they obviously don't take that long to make in the first place.  And the place was not busy.  They get one star because the service was good as was their selection of sauces and because there is no lower rating available.

After hunting down our server she then took 10 minutes to bring back our waters and to take the order. We only saw her twice after taking our order and 3 tables around us had their drinks, food and check brought to them before we even got our food. When we got the food the order was incorrect. We waited an hour and 15 minutes for 4 orders of chicken wings and one spinach dip. No refills, no check back from our server and we asked to see a manager several times and they never came to our table. I had to bus our own table by bringing empty glasses to the bar because our waitress(Mandy) was too busy wiping dirty tables. We were there for over 2 hours to get chicken wings and an appetizer.

After checking in the kitchen, she said they were out of the queso, but the manager would come by and probably give me a discount. The manager DID come over, but just gave a weak apology and reiterated there was no queso. No discount. He did ask if I wanted something else, but by that time I just wanted to leave.

While the server brought the mac 'n cheese out for the girls immediately, the rest of our meals took over 25 minutes to arrive. I had the salmon - it was overcooked and the vegetables were, well, awful. My daughter-in-law's combo appetizer plate was amazing - (grilled chicken wanton tacos-to DIE for!) but clearly her plate held up the rest of our meals. It was fresh and piping hot! All of ours were cold.

We mentioned it to our server, the manger came to our table and apologized, took the salmon off our bill. Nice gesture but then the birthday sundae came to our table about 10 minutes AFTER my husband got his triple chocolate meltdown. Try explaining to a 3 year old why she had to wait for her ""birthday"" sundae! The servers sang the happy birthday thing and it was nice.

THEN.......we waited over 15 minutes to get the bill. Finally, all of us except my husband left. He had ""words"" with the manager about the bill coming so late. Again, we were quite disappointed and will probably not go back again."	0.0

When I mentioned it to my waitress she was concerned she said she'll talk to her manager she came back and said sir you only get 3 ounces of meat on your nachos and I told her that's fine but it wasn't meat it was pure fat and disgusting.

We sat down going over what we wanted on the small menus in front of us.. 15 minutes rolls by and NO service yet. We could tell the bartender noticed us when we took a few minutes looking for a place to sit realizing there was no room at the bar so we took a table in the bar. 

And she never approached us or said hi or welcomed us. As we're sitting there Aaron one of the servers at your location came up to us because he noticed we've been sitting here for awhile now. He asked if we were waiting for drinks and if we've been helped yet. He made sure we got everything we needed and had to go let the bartender ( Ashley) know we were sitting here. Aaron went over the reverse happy hour with us and apologized again for our wait. I am a mom so I know about patience. The girl that was serving us still let us feel uncomfortable and unwelcome like we were an inconvenience for her because we couldn't sit at the bar. So we didn't leave a 20% tip like I usually would because I am in the industry.. Honestly we should've given it to Aaron because he showed us we were welcomed here.

We were seated behind a mgr. interviewing a waitress which was a first for me. It was a bit strange because I thought maybe that should be done somewhere private or at least NOT directly behind a booth of customers so who can overhear the questions & answers. 
We ordered & received our drinks in a reasonable amount of time. HOWEVER, we ordered a chocolate lava dessert (for me) & an all you can eat soup & salad (for my husband) and after TWENTY MINUTES we did not get any food!!! I ended up having to cancel my dessert order & leave to pick up our children from school & drive BACK to the restaurant to get my husband since he chose to go ahead & wait for the food because he really likes the tomato basil, french onion & chicken tortilla soup (he also likes it at Chili's) and the oriental chicken salad as well as the fiesta chicken salad. 
While I was gone he moved to a table in the bar area to see the ""game"" on TV & told me the bartender was friendly. However, I don't plan on going back here for a LOOONG time. Especially since today we went to BJ's Restaurant & Brewery on Superstition Springs & Power where they have all you can eat soup & salad for only $7.95 as opposed to the $9.99 price at Applebee's.

The arugula was soggy on the whole salad. She said she did not want the salad and asked the server to take it back and get something else instead(NOT salad). So all the while we were eating our food she sat there waiting for the waiter to return to order something else. By the time she finally returned to take her order we were bites away from being done. Disappointed because the time it took to get back to her she told the server never mind they are all ready finished with their lunches. The server said okay. When the manager came around he offered to order another salad which she did not want because of the first one. The manager in a joking manner said well I have been so busy sorry I was not there to watch all the food coming out and said the salad had been taken off our bill. I was very disappointed that he approached it that way. Of coarse the salad should not be on our bill she had to send it back because the arugula was no good. He was not doing us a favor be taking it off the bill. Going out to lunch is a treat and not something we get to do all the time.

Our server was Candy and she was really very pleasant. She did a great job of being around when we needed her but was not suffocating.
K and I both ordered the Brunch Burger ($6.99 Monday only). We both loooooove this burger. It is my favorite burger from Applebee's. They sear bacon and onions into the patty and then top it with crispy hash browns, a fried egg, American cheese and ketchup (which I omit). K gets the burger with the ketchup and we both ordered it medium rare. Candy brought us our drinks and our burgers came out in a reasonable amount of time. I ordered chips with mine and K had ordered fries with hers. Both burgers were a bit overcooked. Not enough to send them back, but enough to lessen the ooowee goooey goodness. On both the fried egg was also a bit overdone. I love this burger because I want to cut into or bite into the egg and have it ooze all over the hash browns but both these eggs were past the runny stage. Bummer. The funny thing is the hash browns could have been cooked a bit more. They need to be crispy. Not just because that's what's in the description, but because that's what works with this burger. However, since our eggs were not runny, it didn't really matter. The fries were also just o.k. Not done enough if you ask me. Fries by nature should be crispy. I'm not talking over fried but they have to have some tooth to the texture. These did not. The chips were ok. Nothing special.
If the burger was cooked right, and the eggs were runny, and the hash browns were crispy and the fries were a bit more cooked I would give this visit a 4 Star because Candy was such a good server. But because the burgers were not I have to drop it to a 3 Star. Average. But... here's where this visit looses another star.
These burgers are supposed to come with endless fries. When we asked Candy for another order, hoping that maybe the second order would be a bit crispier, she told us that the Monday night, $6.99 Any Burger Special did not come with endless fries. 
Now, those who know me know I hate having to correct people when it comes to THEIR business. Both K and I knew that wasn't true so we asked her when the policy changed and Candy told us that one of the Manager's at this Applebee's told the employees that the $6.99 Monday burger deal did not come with endless fries. O.K.
So I pulled up the Applebee's website and found the TV ad that showed free refills of fries with the $6.99 Burger. I showed the Ad to Candy and she went back to tell the manager. She came back with another order of fries and told us that ""this manager agrees with you"". In all of this, Candy was very pleasant and continued to apologize for how our experience was going.
Agrees with me? It's on your f*&^#@# Television Ad. It's NOT my idea. I'm not making it up. Why don't the Managers know corporate policy and what's being advertised on TV? Wow.

Owner claimed the pizza delivery guy dropped off the pizza and wings at the front desk of the hotel. Went to the front desk and if they received the pizza they said they would have brought it to my room .  So the ball was dropped somewhere here. Regardless, I'm disputing the charge so good luck and you lost a customer for life. I called Gus pizza next door and spent $50.00 with them instead . I highly recommend Gus pizza!	1.0

Sunday 9/17/17 to explain our food was delivered late, cold and the order was wrong. The manager displayed poor attitude when I called in regarding these issues saying ""what do you want me to do about it?""

For the $1 margaritas, there is no catch, you go in and can get drink after drink after drink for a dollar (50 cents extra for different flavors) the only problem is that they water the drink down after the first one. I came in expecting to leave a bit tipsy, but was basically sipping on juice/grenadine and water by the third one. The food was terrible, it literally tasted like it went from freezer, to microwave, plate, to us...and this was after our waiter forgot what we ordered twice. He did the same for the margaritas, completely forgetting what was ordered and making us wait a very long time. I blame most of this on the rush of a Friday night, but I also think that the restaurant didn't anticipate the high influx of people looking to get cheap alcohol. It wasn't that they were understaffed, it was that the staff was unorganized and overwhelmed. Our waiter also seemed a bit fed up and I get it, but still not the best customer experience."	0.0

I was seated quickly in the bar area as requested. The poor schmuck behind the bar was tasked with covering/serving the entire bar area including all the hi-tops and booths AND mix drinks. 
I ordered and was served a drink relatively quickly given the short staffing. Upon ordering a refill I placed an order for the fish and chips. My food was served within 10 - 15 minutes. The first bite was good but the closer I got to the middle of the piece of fish the colder the food became until it was just plain cold. After informing the bar tender/waiter and sending the plate back, the manager on duty stepped up and apologized for the under-cooked food. About 10 minutes later another order was delivered to my table. This time it was HOT and cooked through.
The point of this review is not to condemn the entire restaurant for the mistake of one cook. The manager's apology was appropriate but an offer to comp the dinner would have been more appropriate and appreciated. Things could have been worse - under-cooked fish - just sayin'."	0.0

On 09/06/2016 I placed an order over the phone to go for my husband to pick up once he got off work. There isn't an applebees near us in South Chandler and this location is close to his work. When he got home as we were ready to set everyones dinner we were missing one full kids order and half of another kids order. My husband headed back with ALL of the food because we werent going to eat our food cold or eat our food before our kids did. Took it all back for them to remake the entire order. We definitely don't complain to look for handouts but you would think because of how much of an inconvenience this was they would offer more than a dessert which we never even ended up getting anyways. My husband was told he was good to go that they guaranteed it. Once again he got home with food and still a kids order was missing a side. I really hope this staff gets a little more coaching. Our kitchen is under quarantine with no access to a stove or microwave because of a mold issue so we have had to rely on take out for the past few days and having to deal with messed up orders makes everything just that much more frustrating.

And we made our dinner orders when we ordered our drinks and we got our appetizers on time and waited forever for our food and come to find out by a new server that took over, that our order was never put in and that she would buy us dessert and she had told the cooks to rush and make our food. If it wasnt so late(after 10pm) and we didnt have to eat we wouldve just left. We finally get our food and my rice was hard and chips were stale.

For starters, they changed the menu several times, making the portions smaller and smaller every time. The quality is not what it was once upon a time. We order our classic spinach and artichoke did and boneless chicken. The chicken was cold when it arrived, and the size of the spinach dip was half of what it used to be. The service was great, the bartender waited on our table during reverse happy hour, he was attentive and prompt. It is not his fault for the screw ups in the kitchen. Our mixed drinks were about the only thing that was good about our meal. The perfect margarita was perfect (considering others always screwed up in Easton, MD) I didn't have to question the bartender on what he added he followed the recipe to the T. Hopefully Applebee's corporate management gets their act together and get the menu back to what it was once.	0.0

First of all the menu doesn't have as many good selections as it used to. I just wasn't in the mood for anything on the menu and I used to love going to AppleBee's. Our waiter came and right away I felt as though I was bothering him. The impression we received is (I have a lot to do hurry and tell me what you want). This is the first review I am giving on yelp, yet realize this has to be read by the establishment (or so I would hope) and they then can work on what needs to be improved. About half way through the meal I don't know what happened but the waiter became friendlier which was nice. The appetizers were good though. The main point of my review is to let servers know to please treat customers friendly from the beginning to end. I am sure they work hard and the customers who came in most likely worked hard all day as well. As for the menu well I probably won't ever go to an Applebee's again. Food selection wasn't good.	0.0

Does anyone even go to this restaurant anymore?
I had not been to Applebees before & thought we will try it out as I had a Gift Card.
There were so many booths & tables open & the person who seats the guests is looking around for a table while stand there.
Before we could even read the menu, the server is at our table to take our order. Either they want to get it over & done with, or they do not show up at all.
I ordered a Margarita & specifically said not too much ice. I get my drink & the glass is half full of ice. I just let it go, as I did not want to say anything.
I  ordered the artichoke & spinach cavaratti as my main meal. I am not even going to say it tasted bad, as there was no taste at all. I don't know what it should even taste like. It was with a basic white sauce & no seasoning at all. Tasted bland.
I had to say something at this point as I was hungry & when food does not taste good, I get very upset. There was not eve. 1 piece of Artichoke to be found. I mentioned this to the server & he said there should be Artichoke in it. I moved my food around& showed him there was nothing. 
If they did flavor it with some sort of Artichoke flavor, I am sorry, I did not taste it.
He then asked if I wanted to speak to a Manager. What was the point? Did the Manager have the artichoke the chef forgot to add?

It is currently 6 on a Sunday night and she is the only server running the floor while there are 6 servers sitting around at random tables scattered over the restaurant watching Regina run around.

The only help she had was the host, Alex, who was seating tables, cleaning tables and checking on food and tables for her. He is doing more than the 6 other servers in the restaurant.

This looks like a clear lack of management going on in this entire restaurant.

When we arrived we were told it was just shift change and they needed a second to clean a table. No big deal. We didn't even wait a whole minute before we were seated... Drinks ordered and arrived quickly. We were a little slow ordering. We were trying to decide on the 2 for $20/$25 deal or something else. Fajitas disappeared from the menu, but they still serve them. Once I found that out, we were ready to order.

Now I wonder if mentioning shift change was a pre-excuse for the horrible service we were about to get...

We ordered what used to be labeled as the Bottomless Chips and Salsa. Price is up by a $1. Thanks, Obamacare! It used to come out on their big round raised plate/tray with a semi-small bowl of salsa. That was OK because they always come back to the table often enough to keep you deep in salsa. Now it comes out on a much smaller tray with a tiny cup of salsa and a few chewy, stale chips... We thought, well, they'll be running their buts off filling that cup... That might have been so if we had seen our server even once before our food arrived. Actually, our server wasn't the one that brought our food so we didn't see her for a while afterward.

Our food had come and our drinks (an iced tea and a water) had been sitting empty for a while. When our server finally made an appearance, she still didn't notice our drinks. We had to mention it to her. I know that sounds a little entitled, but there are expectations of service that used to be standard. You always refill a drink u[ to and while food is on the table or AT LEAST ask to. Half way into our meals we lost interest in the $4 chips and salsa sample.

The entrees were great. At the very least the kitchen is still staffed be good people. I always order the steak fajitas, medium rare, and I eat the steak like a steak and then make veggie tacos out of the rest. I fricken love it. This time I was not disappointed. The steak was not medium rare (they never get that right) but it was still delicious. My dinner companion had a 7oz sirloin and it too was mouth-watering and juicy. Also not cooked as ordered (medium) but that meant I got the redder portions so, no complaint from me there...

We actually got asked if we wanted another refill before we completed our meals. That was nice. However, after we had finished out food we had the desert/drink menu in hand and the waitress walks up and plops the check down and walks away. I may have some strong ideas about service but I don't know any manager that would train tyheir staff to miss an opportunity to offer drinks and deserts. That's not how you sell.

So, it may have been mean but, we left no tip and stopped at DQ for a cone on the way home.

We've already blacklisted the Applebee's on Baseline at 24th St. because of similar service, getting orders and drinks completely wrong, and billing us for things we did not order.

My husband's order came out wrong... They brought his new food with the original potatoes-that were now cold. The oriental chicken salad I ordered was disappointing, basic, and was drenched with dressing. My mudslide had the consistency of chocolate milk and tasted like it too. The food took a long time-which was odd because the place was empty. I would definitely not recommend this restaurant. I wish I would have checked the Yelp reviews before we ate here!	0.0

Our daughter's ""cheese pizza"" was on a tortilla and the cheese was not melted all the way along with WAY too much sauce. Either the waitress or the chef got my order wrong (a totally different dish than I ordered) so while my family ate I had to wait for my food to be remade. Only good part about our experience was that we had a gift card so we only paid $13 after tip."	1.0

Probably won't be going to Applebee's  anymore, I've given this place too many chances and it only gets worse with time. Prices went up and portions went down.

The bartender did not seem happy to be there at all. I've worked in the service industry for 3 years (and still do) and I know that no matter how bad your night maybe you put on a damn smile and be friendly, or at the least attempt to be. 

I know what is annoying to wait staff so I try to be an easy customer. I knew it was happy hour because that's why we went and I like the happy hour drinks, did not receive the happy hour menu that says what food/drinks were on happy hour, fine whatever, didn't ask for it. Got a drink that I knew, from previous trips, was on happy hour. 

Got an appetizer did not receive silverware or napkins. Whatever fine. They also changed it so the pretzels no longer come with cheese and mustard so I had to ask for the other side, which I got an attitude like I was being bothersome (I ask politely and always say thank you). Again whatever.

Got the Thai shrimp salad (sub shrimp for chicken.) This is when we got silverware. Got the salad and I stared at it for a minute, noticing the large bowl but very small amount of salad. See the picture on the menu? Cut that amount in half, that's what you get. It was premixed lettuce/carrot/cabbage, like what you find in the veggie section at Walmart, with edamame beans and the smallest amount of dressing I have ever seen, literally just a drizzle of dressing on top. I ask for a side of dressing. I kept looking at it wondering why the salad appeared different from what the picture was when I ordered, well I looked on the Applebee's online menu, out of pure irritation, it was also supposed to have crunchy wonton noodles, almonds, and cilantro, which my salad did NOT have. How do you miss THREE main parts of the salad?!

Asked us how we were after our food was done.  

At this point I'm just kind of over being there. He was probably the most unfriendly bartender I have ever experienced, you shouldn't feel like your bothering a server when asking for something, that is there job and why you tip, for the service. We still tipped the normal 20% purely based off of being in the industry, not because he deserved it."	0.0

Ordered drinks and we were shocked when we were charged $10 for a tiny margarita.  What a rip. Ordered half off apps menu .You couldn't order more than one per person. I felt like there were a lot of restrictions for the late night menu. 

Food was good, service was ok. Got the bill and our waiter didn't even stay thank you or have good night.  Kind of an awkward way to end the experience. Total bill for a couple appetizers and two drinks was $65

Applebees has changed their menu since I've last been here. They raised their prices and cut back their portions. My husband ordered a burger which was $11 and subpar. Red Robin has the same tasting hamburgers but charges less. 

This restaurant charges $2.50 just to swap out french fries for onion rings. They also had these game systems on the tables. You can play trivia and other games while you wait but each game adds .99 cents onto your bill. .99 cents isn't a lot of money but why add to your bill to play a game when you should be socializing with who you are out to dinner with anyways??

I stopped in for chicken this week. I remember how the KFC chicken used to taste, but was sadly disappointed in the quality of the food.

They ran out of breasts and tried to sub out thighs on one gentleman
Gravy was like paste
Potatoes were like runny  - can't say it in words - would get banned - you get the idea

If you can run, run as fast as you can away from this store. I am not sure the manager is aware of the quality problems, but should be notified. Order taking is akin to having wisdom teeth taken out without Novocain.

Tonight we ordered pizza, wing and the new Waffle Fries. While ordering online I read about their new product, the Waffle Fries, and when it mentioned how good they are and better than others, I chose to purchase them. After order was placed I walked my dog and later received a nice call from an unknown number. I was awaiting delivery so thought it was the actual driver. After I was disconnected, I called that number back and he called me from what was his personal phone. He said he was the manager, was very nice, and asked for the Unit Number at the Candlewood Suites. I had included that in my order and had to with my billing information, however I just advised him and he said the driver was out the door. So I waited. And waited. And waited. About 35 minutes later the driver in non-Pizza Hut uniform or t-shirt or ID bypassed us and went into the hotel. The manager made him aware, as we ran in, that we were awaiting the pizza at the front door. I tipped and signed the receipt and thanked the driver as I don't think he's the one responsible for the tardiness in delivery. It was about 1030pm and traffic here was normal and we are immediately off the freeway exit. When we got to our room, the first thing we did was open the box of Waffle Fries. They looked like they were old and greasy to be completely honest. Both my partner and I tried one and then another and he said, ""These are not even room temperature"" and I agreed. The wings were fine, pizza could have been much warmer, so just popped into microwave. However, we could not continue to eat the fries. Jon called the number that had called my cell phone to contact me about the room number, the gentleman who was very kind on the phone and said pizza was going out the door. That door must have been far, far away from the parking lot as it took long time to wait outside for the pizza and fries and wings. Jon called and eventually the man, who was not at all as kind as when he called me, eventually said it was Pizza Hut. Jon told him who we were and that our Fries were not hot, not warm-maybe room temperature and greasy. Jon said ""We wanted to let you know as we just received them and they were not as advertised at all!"" The man said ""This is my personal cell phone and not the business!"" Well we didn't know that as we ordered online and he called US on my cell phone. He was bothered and offered no sort of ""I'm sorry"" and absolutely no offer to send out a hot order. We tipped well and would have tipped very well to have a kind and proper manager resend out a failed new product. They are still sitting here. In all honesty, we offered one to our dog and he had no interest. Maybe we just caught the manager on a bad night. But that's not my problem. I should have been told the actual time to expect the pizza and not the very short time that it would have been if he was out the door. The manager should have understood that we called back at the same number he called us at. He offered no offer to refund the price of the waffle fries or other warm products. We order regularly and have for many years. It's often take out and maybe that's a better route to go with this store. I'm upset that he didn't offer to send some new product out or to offer even 20 percent off the next order. Shame on you, Manager and the North Phoenix Pizza Hut."	0.0

Second issue: we were there for over 45 minutes and the only interactions we had with any staff was when they bumped into us while we played.  We were never asked if we would like something to drink or eat. On our way out we spoke to a manager and where told that the servers were trained to ignore people playing at those games. No apologies or offers to make it right. Just an explanation that this is how they train their staff to treat their customers.	1.0

I ordered the Dark Horse Cabernet after debating on what I was drinking for a good 10 min, the bartender said she didn't have it.

We didnt get refills hardly ever, even when we asked several times. When asking to speak to a manager, a blonde lady named Dina came over with a pleasant smile seeming like she would help us out, but she only made the experience worse. She didn't seem to take any accountability for what was going on, & refused to do anything for us. (Acting like we were making a big deal out of nothing). We have never had a bad experience with Bdubs until coming here. And the manager Dina was the worst part of all. I thought she treated our family with a little disrespect & rude, but when I watched her throughout the restaurant interacting with the staff, she treats them just as worse.

I'd understand him refusing to put the sound on for the hockey game if the fight was actually happening at that moment, but the fights hadn't even started yet and wouldn't for another four hours. He told me the prelim fights were on but he wasn't even on the correct channel! He further told me that if he put the sound on for hockey that would upset the UFC fans, and once UFC actually started he would have to switch the sound again, which in turn would upset the hockey fans. Mind you, I only saw one guy wearing an affliction shirt, so I think it's safe to say that the UFC fans hadn't really arrived yet.

I just found it very odd that the manager was more concerned about customers that weren't even there yet then customers that were in his restaurant spending money at that moment. Apparently, customers that will spend $5 to nurse their beer the whole night in order for them to watch a PPV fight are more important then my girlfriend and I who ordered beers, an appetizer, and 20 wings.

One thing BBW needs to do is cater to ALL sports fans. Of allllllll the TV's in there, only one had a hockey game on, and it was behind me. Every few minutes I would crane my neck around to check the score, as not many waitresses were around to change channels for us. All they had on was lame college football. zzzzzzzzzz"	1.0

Not a good experience - the music was so loud that we could barely hear ourselves talk.  The dining room was so crammed with tables, it was completely uncomfortable.  We ordered regular and boneless wings, and we told ten minutes later that they had run out of boneless wings.  The server had told us that the wing sauce was not spicy, yet we couldn't even eat it.  There was nothing good to say about this visit, and though it is right around the corner, we will not be back.	0.0

No smile, no emotion, she just straight to the point - ""Drinks?"" and walked off while I held my food order in my head. She returns and I order, gives me the same cold emotionless attitude and walks off. We eat, the food is actually good but we quickly called for the check. The waitress asked ""Now is there ANYTHING else you need?"" I'm sitting here eating, I didn't ask you for an extra straw, an extra napkin or anything so why give me this attitude like I'm overworking you?

After the bill comes I'm overcharged and the manager explains I was charged a bill from a different table. I receive a refund but this isn't the type of experience I'd shoot to duplicate. I'm pretty much over this place now that it's become so cold and dead. The last time I came there was a drunk ""air-humping"" his girl/some chick the whole time while she played her video games.

Dear Customer Service Representative,

At the above mentioned date, time and location, myself and my wife visited the restaurant.  Our very poor experience started with the hostess stand which was manned by two, ""carefree children"" with no desire to conduct their duties or give an ounce of respect or greetings to customers.  Their pre-recorded wait time answer of ""we don't know"" was given to us and I was amused enough to take the pager and go wait with other patrons in line.  Total wait time 40+ minutes.

As we walked through the 3/4 full restaurant to the nearly empty patio we were seated in an area that had verifiably not been occupied for our entire wait time.

Drink order (no alcohol) took over 20 minutes to arrive and the food order was finally taken.  Basically, we were forgotten.  Also, not a single patio table had been bussed during our entire visit (approx. 2 hrs.)  As the food arrived after at least another 40 minutes there was no silverware, napkins or ordered sauces provided.  Our waitress went back to retrieve them and blamed the entire overwhelmingly unacceptable experience on the kitchen staff.  That's about the lowest one can go in the food service industry.

The reason I decided to write today is because EVERY time we come here, the service is extremely poor.  This is never the case at the Tempe location, which we love.

Thanks in advance for your attention in this matter"	3.0

Then she brought us our check without checking to see if we needed boxes which we did. We had asked for separate checks which we did not receive!

My favorite used to be the Spicy Korean and now, it's not even close to the same. It's now a sweet/spicy instead of savory/spicy and it lacks ALL of the great veggies it used to have. I miss the carrots, mushrooms and pea pods that were replaced with bean sprouts scallions, and red bell pepper. Rice was also lower quality and improperly cooked. Impossible to eat with chop sticks because it wasn't remotely sticky. As for the new addition of sushi? Please stick to what you used to do well. I took a chance despite a bad sushi experience at PFChangs. Pei Wei's sushi was clearly pre made and refrigerated or possibly frozen ten thawed as the rice was hard and cold and crumbled when picked up. The only happy person of the four of us was the 6 year old that ate plain noodles. The rest of us were very disappointed and won't be back unless Pei Wei goes back to quality over cost savings.	0.0

The only shining star in this restaurant is Hector. He is an ace and should work in a much better restaurant. Hector replaced our edamame. It  was still soggy, but steaming hot and Hector was happy to do it. Hector also replaced my incorrect meal with what I actually ordered. Hector is always so nice to everyone.

I used to crave your Thai Dynamite. The formerly juicy delight was dry with little to no sauce at all. The once crispy chicken had random bites where the breading was a mess of powdery and damp as if it weren't fully cooked.

I don't know what has happened over the years but the steady decline in quality really saddens me.

The one saving grace this last time was that the rice was at least cooked properly. I don't know if it's a California Pei Wei thing to over/under cook the rice, but at least they can do it right in Arizona (which is very surprising...).

It's a shame, because it has been so long since we ate at one and we were looking forward to it. Watching the hubby still pulling out shredded carrots right now!

I ordered a Teriyaki Bowl with Rice noodles and Tofu/Veggies, regular size, $12! 

When I get the food I start to eat the veggies and when I get to the noodles they were cold and rock hard. As if they were undercooked and just sitting there waiting to be thrown in to someone's dish.

I tell who I assume to be the manager on site based off her outfit, she had them remake it but offered no discount or compensation seeing as how I was on my lunch break I didn't have time to wait another 15 min. In her defense I did not voice this to her but you would think some sort of a discount would have been offered at this point. 

I get the next batch and this time the noodles are way over cooked but I'm so hungry at this point I'm just going to eat it.

When the scolding hot noodles finally cooled down I start to notice MULTIPLE fragments of orange chicken through out my bowl, being vegan this could cause me to get sick.

At this point I threw in the towel and stopped eating to get back to work. Frustrated.

This place used to be my FAVORITE place to eat I even put it on my Yelp profile under ""things I discovered"". And now it's just gone completely downhill. 

Lack of quality AND quantity!

They keep pushing this whole ""lighter fit menu"" but what they are really saying is ""give us more money for less food""

Once they got rid of the ""Spicy Korean"" I knew it was the beginning of the end. I have given it too many chances.. OVER PRICED chances at that. I will not be returning to Pei Wei."	5.0

They had a hard time hearing the girl at the counter and she was not happy about it yelling back to them. When we got up to the front she started complaining to us about all of the elderly customers this location gets. My boyfriend ordered orange chicken with white rice and wanted to add an additional side of lettuce cups. She told him that this was not possible, but at every other pei wei it has never been a problem. We finally convinced her to ask another employee and they helped her add the side of lettuce. When our food came everything was good as usual but the lettuce wraps did not come. When my boyfriend went back to the counter to ask they tried to charge him for another side. At this point he just wanted to eat his food and gave up. Will not be back to this location. Sad because Dana park is such a nice little area.	1.0

The table we sat at also bad not been cleaned off or wiped down. My husband and I waited over 20 minutes for 4 cold crab wontons and then about another 20 minutes for our main entrees. They also did not have any clean forks out. I had asked the girl if we could get 2 forks when she gets a chance. She said sure and then never returned. The manager had seen that the forks cannister was empty and put a forks cannister up on the counter. She saw and looked at us and never came back with forks. I would have veen fine if the manager had come over and apologized for the wait and offered a buy one get one or whatever. Nothing.

My husband and I swung through to pick up some Pei Wei on our way home. We usually never have problems and the food is good. However, this time was different. I ordered the steak teriyaki on noodles and a cup of the wonton soup. My husband got sweet and sour steak on fried rice and a thai chicken roll. His food was fine.

I LOVE the wonton soup and was excited to eat it when we got home. I put my daughter to bed and then pulled the top off my soup and began to eat. The soup is fairly murky so I didn't notice the issue until I was over halfway through the cup and had eaten most of the greens and all three wontons: there was an insect, a fly of some kind, smashed up against the side of the plastic dish. I immediately set the cup of soup down, feeling really nauseous. I'd eaten this.

I'm not trying to shame Pei Wei or their employees as our experience there is usually very good, but I feel the need to share this with them on Yelp since I took a picture of the insect, and the restaurant is now closed so I cannot return to speak with them directly.

Working in food-service, we know that insects are not only gross to be in food, but can harbor potential foodborne illnesses and be a huge problem. Employees MUST, at least, look at the container they are using to ensure that it isnt contaminated before we give it to a customer to eat.

I live about a mile and a half away from the Dana Park location. We do take out every time and every time I get the same thing, orange peel steak. I do not like rice (yes, I know, I know) so I always order mine on the side and give it to someone else. So basically one time I picked up the order, rice was on the side but when I got home I noticed they must have messed up and initially mixed it with the meal because I had rice with my steak, but they scraped off as much as possible. I let it go, I was too lazy to get dressed, grab my keys and head out. Well it happened a second time and the more I thought about someone sitting there scraping rice off my food the more pissed I got. The manager was there, I told her what had happened and that this was the second occasion for this. She had them remake the steak and sent me on my merry little way. It is not my style to be rude when someone messes up but geez offer me a soda when I am sitting there, throw in a 20 percent off coupon for the next order, or comp the entree you messed up! I am not one who is looking for freebies or else I would have taken my food back the first time this happened.

Well today I decided to try the fried rice with extra chicken. I also went with a friend who got the sesame chicken and white rice. We went around 3:30pm, and it was not busy at all. We waited about 30 minutes until my friend got her food and the order was wrong, they didn't give her extra chicken. Then we waited another 10mins for mine order. My food was okay (not the greatest in flavor or texture) and my friend's was spicy, that is normal, well they bring extra chicken and the flavor is completely different, and my friend found pieces of plastic in her drink. Anyways, while we are eating two employees sit down next to us with a friend and one of the employees (very loudly) starts complaining about a customer who had asked for a manager because they waited 1 hour for rice with sauce. The girl proceed to talk about how they didn't have a manager and continued to complain about this customer. I decided to leave. Once I get home I proceeded to get sick from the food.

Picking up lunch for my wife because we had errands to run during her lunch. Ordered her ONE single order of lettuce wraps, that's it. I placed the order at 11:20 because I know around 12 they get insanely busy. The girl told me it would be ready at 11:40. I showed up at 11:40, paid, then began the incredible wait. I watched 10 other orders come in and be processed. One of the orders was a guy who came in, placed his order at the store, got his food before me. A few others waited briefly and the take out girl offered the waiting customers beverages, lucky me, I had already purchased a drink. Mind you, this was for ONE order of lettuce wraps. One. Finally at 12:00 I walked up to her and asked her what was going on. Shockingly my order was nowhere to be found. They asked me what I ordered, I told them. She finally gave me my single order of lettuce wraps at 12:10. Missed our appointments and barely had time to eat. 

A few ladies walked in and told me that this happens all the time. So either PeiWei just doesn't care or they are incompetent to an absurd level.

I love that they now offer small size portions, as we like to order appetizers and the regular portions were always too large. But several things have gone downhill since their renovation. The tables were mostly empty when we visited, but they were all covered in plates and leftover food. It took nearly 10 minutes to track someone down to wipe down a table. When our food arrived, my husband and son were confused at the size, thinking they had accidentally ordered a small, as their plates were full of rice with a sad side of meat. It now feels like more of a fast food restaurant without the plastic dishes, versus the old PeiWei that seemed like a great balance between take out and sit down. I think next time we'll take the kids to panda instead and head to PF'S for date night.	0.0

The food is mediocre and not the highest quality that I have ever had.  I went out to dinner with two friends before a movie we were going to see.  We had arrived an hour and a half earlier then the movie would start ensuring we would have enough time to eat and make it to the movie on time.  We were seated in a decent amount of time.  The server took about 20 minutes to come over to take our drink orders.  Once we had ordered, she came back 30 minutes later with our drinks.  At this point we were a little frustrated with the service.  We asked if we could order right away because we had a movie to get to and she was aware of this.  She took our order and said it would be out shortly.  We waited for 40 minutes before we started to get impatient.  After about 55 minutes we grabbed another waitress, since ours was no where to be found and asked her what was taking so long.  She said she would go check on our food for us and came back to inform us that our order had not even been placed.  We were furious.  I immediately went and complained to the manager about how horrible the service we had received was and how our waitress had taken over an hour and had not even placed our order.  The manager apologized profusely and said that she would get our meals out right away and that they would be on the house.  We were so angry and disappointed in the service and once our food was finally brought out we were continually disappointed by the low quality of the food.  Once we had finally left the movie had already started and we were forced to wait until the next showing of the movie.

We sat at the bar and watched the 3 couples ahead of us get seated and then 2 that came in after us. All the while there was 3 dirty tables in the bar. Asked the hostess if someone could clean one of them and she said  no, they were for people waiting. The bartender Monica was super sweet and helpful and got the manager. He had a table cleaned for us and the hostess put someone at it. Fine we took the next table. It took our server 10 minutes to get to us and while waiting for our food my bf noticed something floating in my drink. GROSS... Then when we got our food our server didn't give us any silverware or napkins. THANK GOODNESS for Monica. Again she came to the rescue. I wish I could remember the managers name. He was super helpful and very apologetic. 1 star for Monica and 1 star for the sweet manager.	2.0

Never, ever, have I seen such a disgraceful presentation of a 1/2 rack of ribs in my frikin entire life. You should be ashamed of putting that on a plate to serve to a customer. I feed my Toy Chihuahua bigger portions.
Looking at the size of the ribs were compared to what my dogs ribs looked like. Funny my dogs ribs had more meat. 
Mr District Manager, you need to check whats going out on the plates. If you sitdown and order this meal, you would be just as disappointed as my wife and I were.
Both of us being in the restaurant business for a total of 80 years combined, cooking and managerial,  we know if you wouldn't eat it, don't serve it. Your people need to take ownership and speak up when they see something wrong. I just cant believe this was allowed to be served. It looks like it was boiled all night and then re-heated in microwave. It was as tough as jerky.
Shame, shame, shame on you.
The funny thing about this ordeal is that I made the mistake. I was supposed to go to Chili's for the ribs which looked good on tv, and I mixed up the names and went to you guys. Never again."	1.0

I brought my niece who was visiting Phoenix with her husband and kids figuring it would be easy for everyone to find something on the menu they could enjoy.  Things started out fine with the service and we ordered some appetizers.  Food order was taken and we were enjoying our visit.  It wasn't very busy but yet a different waiter brought out the first few dishes of lunch and asked ""who had the shrimp?""  Several of us ordered a shrimp dish but my niece said ""I had the wait watchers shrimp.""  ""Ahhh, this must be yours then"" said the waitress.  After a few bites my niece realized it was not the shrimp dish she ordered.  The remaining plates had still not arrived and we explained to the waitress the error when she delivered the remaining plates.  We asked for a new meal to be prepared for my wife and she left with the plate.  Now this is where it gets good.  

Our waiter then comes back to our table with the original dish that my niece had eaten from and proceeds to place it in front of my wife saying ""this one's yours, right?'  We agreed that was what she ordered but that my niece had been mistakenly served the plate and had taken a few bites from it.  His response????  ""That's ok, your all family right?""  He seemed shocked we asked to have a fresh plate created.  Family or no family that is quite an assumption to be made!  My wife had never met this part of my family and being a registered nurse has a little thing about proper preparation, etc of food.  Wow, was all we could say.  He reluctantly went to the kitchen and 10 minutes later returned with a fresh (hopefully) dish.

I don't mind having a busy server as long as they have a good attitude.  Out server was great. He was not the problem. Our wings came out extremely dry and crunchy, it is obvious that it was thrown into the frier a couple times. The wings were so dry and and crunchy they were clearly old wings.  The fries came out a while after the wings and we're dark brown. Clearly those were refried a couple times and they tasted awful.   This has been about the third time I've come and each time the wings come out tasting very old. I will not be coming back and would not recommend this location.  Food is awful.  Except for the Wong tong chicken tacos. Those are the bomb. Also, I had a Pina colada and the drink was extremely watered down.  The drink tasted more watery than it should've been.  Could have been due to the fact that the server was busy and it may have been sitting at the bar for 15 minutes.  It came out shortly before dinner was out.	0.0

I can think of so many other local places that serve quality American food but for some reason, we find ourselves at Applebees at least twice, maybe 4-5 times a year.

We ordered and paid for the food online, thinking it would be much faster and I'd be able to just pick up and go, but it took close to an hour for it to be ready.  This is especially slow service considering the website quoted 20 min.  However, the length of time it took to get our food makes sense considering my steak was bland and well done.  I had asked for my steak to be medium rare, the garlic green beans were over cooked and the sweet potatoes looked like slop.  At best, this reminded me of my high school cafeteria food!  How is it possible that they think it's ok to sell food like this, especially for the price that they sell it for?   I couldn't even justify that the reason it was less than good was because they were busy.  that was not the case.

So off we went, it was 7pm on St Patty's Day but only had a 15 min wait, which we thought was pretty cool.  When we got to our booth, we talked about the times we had been there , and how one time my son was just being a jerk and the rest of us were starving and he only ordered celery, it was fun talking about the old memories.

We went with the 2 for 20 deal, and the food tasted great, our service was friendly and fast, it was the end of the meal and we just paid and then my son looked down on the floor and just said oh my, I looked at him because he doesn't say that that much and I said whats going on,  he said mom, just move fast and lets leave a mouse just ran by our feet...I said WHAT!! He said yes, it was this big showing me with his hands and said just move carefully and lets go, let me tell you I wanted to puke my dinner up right then....but I didn't, I left the tip, because she was good, and we left.

Something really wrong seems to have happened at this location. Food was just okay, and the service atrocious.  With multiple tables clear and available we were told there was a twenty minute wait.  When asking about the tables that were clean and clear, we were told they were reserved - at Applebee's? Another family ahead of us, made the decision to go next door to IHOP!  We eventually did something we've never done before, we confiscated one of the various empty tables.  By the time dinner came around, we found the servings were adequate, but the taste and apparent quality of our fare was less than noteworthy!  At this visit we tried the Club Grill Sandwich with Sweet Potato Fries which was nothing to write home about, and the Fish & Chips with French Fries.  As a traditional Fish & Chips lover, and often ordered at Applebee's, I found the fish and its batter was considerably bland, unlike many others I've enjoyed over the years in many another Applebee's.  Although the server was nice and very apologetic for the inconvenience, and the on duty manager also apologized, we found the incident very discomforting and aggravating to experience from what usually has been a favorite. Hopefully this a one-off incident, but it may take a long time before I frequent this Applebee's again. Consommateurs d'être prudents.	3.0

We didn't receive our food for 40 minutes. You wouldve thought we had the most complicated order ever!! A regular burger shouldn't take that long.

Was going around and taking food order, but one person in our party wasn't ready and she said she would come back to her. She finished taking the rest of our orders and then forgot to take hers. Someone had to go and tell her that she had forgotten. People make mistakes so that was understandable. Then our food came out after about 35+ minutes. Not cool when you have three little kids. Our food came out fine and my son needed a refill, the server actually noticed it and asked if she could get him another and I said yes. 5 minutes later he still didn't have his drink and he was asking for it. We had asked for ranch and pickles when we ordered and they were not brought out with the food either. Two people in the party had soup/salad and had finished their salad completely before they had to remind the server about the soup. Then when they reminded her she came back with one soup and said sorry they have to make more. So she waited another 10 min for her soup which came out so hot she couldn't even eat it right away anyway. The rest of us were finished eating by then.

Décor: So, this is a Red Robin, and when you walk in they have the hostess station. They have  a full sports bar on the right, with general seating out on the main floor for both booth seating and table top. Décor is basic in nature, lots of stuff on the walls to keep your mind busy, and TV's to watch games.
Service: This is where things start to fall downhill. When we got seated, a group of 4, our server arrived. I won't use his name here, but it seemed like we were a nuisance to them. We ordered our drinks, and he asked if we wanted the table iPad things to play paid games and what not. We politely declined, but guess what, he still brought it. He wouldn't engage with us, and when we tried, it wasn't worth it. By the way, that little table top thing? It charged us 2 bucks for a ""entertainment fee"". I DIDN'T ASK FOR THAT THING. Apparently, we had to use it to pay the bill. I believe if the server wants a tip, they have to earn it, not just expect 20% regardless. There is more to this, but I don't want to be bashing, he could've had a bad day.

Food: Sigh, I know it's a chain burger place, but I had higher hopes. The burger was super sloppy, and the bun basically was so soggy that it turned into mush. We had 4 people order the fries, we only got 2 ""baskets"" of ""bottomless"" fries. It was smaller than a McDonalds small fries. We got charged for 2 upgrades to sweet potato fries, but only got 1. I mean, if this is supposed to be your ""thing"", then you need to follow through.

Overall: Sadly, I probably will not come back here ever again. I would rather go to In N Out or 5 Guys. If they can get better service, and the food quality can go up for the price they're trying to push for ""gourmet"" burgers, I will return. If you do decide to go, go during a slower time, maybe you'll get better service and food."	0.0

We ordered our food and usually it doesn't take too long for it to come out. But that day it took forever. It seemed like maybe they had lost out order or the server didn't put it in right away because we had a lot of people checking up on us after the food was brought out. 
I had ordered a cheeseburger. The same thing I always get and I was very disappointed. The burger wasn't cooked how I had asked for it to be cooked. I like it pink in the middle and I know they can't do medium rare so I get it he rarest they can make it. But it was well done. There were some burnt areas and boy could I taste it.

We ordered mushrooms and mozzarella sticks, the mozzarella sticks were good but the mushrooms weren't cooked right, and the breading on them were gross. Our basket was filled with sauce and then covered with mushrooms to hide that they spilt sauce.  The ""nacho cheese"" for the burger was disgusting and cold, when you think nachos, you don't think cold sauce. The burger didn't taste good either and usually they are fine.

The changes are, sadly, not good. I already groaned when they insisted on now calling their ""chipotle mayo"" ""chipotle aoli."" Clearly ""aoil"" costs more than ""mayo"" so that's a reason why the prices have gone up. In addition, the ""garlic fries"" that come with an upcharge used to have real garlic on them but now come with a simple seasoning. Additionally, our fries that came with the burger were cold, so we asked for fresh fries. When we received those, they were cold, as well. When we followed up they insisted thay they were taken out fresh. If that is he case, there is something seriously wrong with the equipment. We spoke with the manager but he did not seem to care and did not offer any real consolation and treated us as if we were just being difficult.

We asked to move and she told us they didn't have room anywhere else.... she offered us alcohol 5 or 6 times I secretly think she wanted to drink. I eat here 4 times a year but every time I'm here I feel like there are 20 new items and whatever I liked last time is gone. Now they charge for sauce for your fries? 75 cents?!? You know Ketchup is free right? Not a great idea to charge for something simple when every other option gives away free food.... anyways we won't be back.	1.0

I had to ask for a box when she dropped off some more fries, she never came back. Asked for a box again, she said yes but continued to fill drinks and take orders and deliver orders. Finally she says ""I'm bringing you that box right now"" as she's dropping off food at the table next to us. Never comes back. Finally comes close enough for us to get her attention, ask for a box again. Get no apology; finally 5 minutes later she brings I shit you not the worlds smallest box for my burger, fries, and other sides. I don't understand why she couldn't of just grabbed the box and brought it back, and gave us literally 2 minutes of her time.

First off we always have to wait.  I understand waiting if there is a wait, but not when the place is half or more empty.   Every time they offer the same excuse.  A server called in sick.  Actually 4-5 would have to have called in, but I don't believe them regardless.  It's this way all the time.

They serve 'bottomless' fries, which is great for kids.  However, now you have to plan on the first batch and those that actually come with your sandwich being cold.   They'll say they are sorry and bring more in 15 minutes.

They have an elaborate allergy procedure, which is important to us, and the kitchen will mess up the first and maybe second time anyway.  Other than the time it's not so bad when you expect it.  

Refills are hit or miss depending on the server but generally better than most places.  The food itself is still about as good as it always has been, it just takes a lot longer now.

If you complain to the manager (assuming there is a real issue) he will handle it well, say he's sorry, and usually comp the wrong meal.  He'll say they are better than this and ask for another chance.  Unfortunately there's only so many of those to be had."	1.0

My folly comes with their new electronic pay stations at your table.  I do like that they are trying to evolve with the times; however, we had an error occur when we tried to use it.  It took around 20-30 min to get it resolved after dealing with our server, the manager and the third person who didn't even introduce themselves.  My complaint comes from having to take an extra 20-30 min to resolve an issue with their system and then not even getting compensated.  My recommendation,  get your free burger once a year but avoid other wise.  Better burger places in the valley like Giant Hamburgers, Haven Burger or Chuck Box.	0.0

Someone from the bar came to clean our table and told us the waitress would be by in a few minutes.  She came to take our drink order , 1 diet, 1 ice tea.  Three other tables were filled after we arrived.  Our drinks were filled and then our order was taken.  We waited, and waited, and waited for our food.  My husband finished his drink.  The waitress came by.  We asked her about our food.  She told us the kitchen fell behind with the mad rush of lunch guests.  When the waitress returned with a refill of ice tea, my husband pointed out that one other guest who arrived after us were already eating.  She tried to apologize and said the manager was already aware and would comp our lunch, and/or would also come over to speak to us.  The manager Mario came over and told us our ticket was ""lost"" and they were working on our order, there were no excuses, and he would comp our lunch.  So we sit there waiting patiently, by then the other 3 tables were eating.  Really, I felt like crying.  I'm sure about 45 minutes went by before we got our food.  I got my bowl of lettuce, which was supposed to be a caesar salad w/o any dressing.  I waited, and waited for our waitress to ask for dressing.  When she returned to our table, any good waitress would see an empty glass and take it with her to refill, she leaves to get the dressing, returns, and leaves again, without asking to refill the ice tea.
You see Mario, I don't think it's the fact that someone in the kitchen lost the ticket to our food.  I believe your waitress needs some training.  I think she forgot to put in our ticket and that was the delay of our food, plus she's not attentive to customers as a good waitress should be.  I worked in the restaurant business so I know how things work.  
We should have just paid for our drinks like we wanted and went somewhere where there's good service.  Sorry Red Robin..........not this time.  
My husband and I each have a Red Robin Royalty account and have had it for years.  We often place orders by phone and pick up here.  It will be a long time before we visit this establishment again.

Think about it, a class A restaurant that actually does make a good burger doesn't need to play hide and seek with their menu items . . . ever!

If I were to rate Red Robin burgers over other burgers I've had in my life, I'd give them around a 5/10.  They are simply sub-par and lack any real good burger flavor.  I did enjoy a pot roast burger they used to make, but good old corporate idiots took it off the menu.

The main thing with any Red Robin is it's all about atmosphere and friendly service, which they do rate a 10 in that department.  Unfortunately, the food is nothing to write home about.  There's literally nothing on their menu that I would find so good it's addictive, and isn't really, really good food what a restaurant should be about?  It's kind of sad, really.

2016	bVPTxKhjj4qyTF7_43nY-g	0.0	0.0	1.0	My family and I have been going to Red Robin for years.  WE LOVE their food and the ambiance of the restaurant.   However, over the last year we have been experiencing impersonal rude staff and slacking service all around.  For example, at the Red Robin on Elliot and Kyrene the last few times we have eaten there our waiter/waitress was nom existent, refills on drinks were nearly impossible let alone getting napkins or condiments.  Also in April I went there for my sons 9th birthday because my kids love the happy birthday song they sing and the free ice cream.  WELL on this day we were told that they were too busy to sing and the ice cream was just dropped off at the table.  I get it I understand things happen but he was super disappointed.  Taking this as a teaching moment I explained to my son that being a server is hard and maybe they were short staffed.  We decided to try a different location for our next Red Robin ventures and the next time we went to the Tempe Market place restaurant.  Here we had a similar problem and when my food was served there was a big black hair in it.  I really do hate being that person that complains about their food, as I have worked in the service industry as well.  I showed the waitress and apologized for being a pain and she told me she would bring me a new meal.  Well my children had already been served and began to eat.  By the time my replacement meal came, which mind you was an avo-cobb-o salad..... My children had finished eating.  If you have children, you know that once the kids have finished eating good luck trying to scarf your meal before the complaints start.  But here comes the worst part...well for me anyways, as I started scarfing my salad I noticed that there was no bacon.  Not only did they take FOREVER to replace my hairy meal they had left off the BACON!!! At this point the manager came over to ask if everything was alright, I explained to him the situation and he apologized but when I received my check nothing had been adjusted.  Like I said I used to be a server and I didn't want to cause a scene so I just paid my bill left 20% and went on my way deciding that this was not the Red Robin for me either.  Finally, we get to the Main Event of this story, Friday July 29, 2016 we took my older son out for his birthday because his absolute favorite place to go is RED ROBIN.  My son has autism and was turning 11.  So we picked a new Red Robin Location to try again.  This time we went to the Red Robin on Stapley and the 60.  Once we were seated the waitress took our order and walked away.  I went after her to tell her that it was my son's birthday and that we would like him to get the birthday treatment.  I could tell she was irritated that I had interrupted her from doing what she was doing so I apologized and thanked her for her time. Well I may be the one in my family who avoids conflict but my mother does not allow people to walk on her and especially not her grandkids.  When I sat back down I told her what had happened and she was a little upset.  So we went on with our lunch.  When our meal was served my burger was missing an add on I had requested but we didn't say anything.  The waitress realized and said that she forgot to tell the chef and that she would bring my add on of avocado on a plate.  Letting that go we had continued on with our meal.  Once finished with our meal the waitress came over and asked if we wanted any dessert, well I looked at her kind of perplexed because she was supposed to be doing the birthday surprise with singing and ice cream.  then she realized and said oh are you ready for the ice cream now? This was upsetting because we were trying to surprise my son for his birthday.  Next she just brought the ice cream and told us that they were too busy to sing.  That was basically the last straw!!! We did find the manager and explained everything and he still would only discount us $10 from our total bill..... SO moral of the story is as much as we love the food at Red Robin their service is deplorable and I will not give a dime of my money to this franchise until their service problems are rectified!!!	1.0

My family and I went to Game Seven Grill on the evening before Superbowl 49, at around 7:15pm.  While we waited for a table, I used the restroom.  It was a mess, lacking in toilet paper and with mounds of wet paper on the floor.  As I returned to the hostess podium, I saw another female patron tell the manager about the condition of the bathroom, so I did not.  At that point, we were seated, at approximately seven thirty.  As with Dwayne O.'s review, we were seated in the back area of the restaurant, in the new girl's section.  Our server, was quick to greet us and take our order.  We were seated ten feet from the bar, so we guessed that our order of three sodas would not take long....we were wrong.  At 7:49 we received our drinks, nearly twenty minutes after we had been waiting.  Two bartenders were just standing behind the bar, but seemed unconcerned that we were sitting ten feet away with no drinks, no silverware and no food.  We did also notice at least five bussers who walked around with bus tubs cleaning tables and removing plates from other patrons.  When our server brought our drinks, she explained it was her first day (!) and said that someone was supposed to help her out with dropping off the drinks, but they ""sent a lot of people home.""  On a Saturday night.  At 7:30pm.  With the Superbowl in town and hundreds of thousands of people milling around outside...Yeah, sure.  As we waited for our food, we noted a couple who sat at one of the tables beside us and then move to the bar.  They received their food before we did, as did the other two tables around us.  At 8:10, a full twenty minutes after the drinks, we received our food.  Our server again apologized and said the ""kitchen had gotten backed up"" but that did not seem to slow the service to the others around us. The menu was very limited, so we ordered two cheeseburgers and my son ordered wings.  The burgers were okay; nothing special and I could not taste the pepper jack cheese on my burger.  My son, 12, eats anything...and I mean anything.  However, he could only eat four of his eight wings because they were a touch too tough and over-sauced.  He got 8 wings for $10.95 with no side...clearly a disappointment.  When we were finally finished, we spoke with the manager at the hostess station.  I explained our disappointment, he apologized several times and said there was nothing he could do for this experience, just the next one and I assured him there would be no ""next one"". As a former restaurant server and manager, I can honestly say that I will never again visit Game Seven Grill."	0.0

Only had to wait 5 minutes and were seated as far from the entrance as possible and I thought this is going to be bad because we were tucked in a corner away from everyone else. We sat there for over 10 minutes  with no one that ever came to our table to even acknowledge us. My wife asked one of the people if there was some one to take our order and a nice person came over to get our drinks. The sad thing was we found out our real waitress walked by us a number of times without even talking to us. Her name was Merideth. The other person who was to setup the beer garden took our order and was the one who got our drinks, when she got our order she told us today was her first day. After we got our food and we were almost done eating Merideth came by to finally acknowledge us and then asked us about our drinks. I told my wife Merideth did not deserve a penny and a the tip should have gone to the other peraon.

As for the food, the menu consists of wings, one burger, pulled pork sandwich and 2 pizzas.

I ordered the burger medium and came out well, the fries were good and the bun was too big for the burger patty. It came with lettuce tomato and onions.

The pulled pork sliders were good and topped with a tasty bbq sauce.

We also had the cheese pizza which the top was half burnt.

The wings were meaty.

Should have not eaten here and the service did not exist.

Will not come back and hope you don't either. Service absolutely  was terrible except the new girl. She gives this place one star."	2.0

FIrst off, there is little seating unless you have a RESERVATION!  Many available tables to the left of the entrance for reservations, but for folks without a reservation tables were to the right side.  Our choices were inside where there was a bar and about 15 tables (all full) , or outside where there were about 5 tables and some red picnic tables lined up.  

The picnic tables were so close together some were difficult to get between and were filthy!  Plus, the red seemed to rub off on clothes and shoes.

Now we could deal with all that seeing as the place is right outside the stadium.  So we found a table and tried to order food.  We had to ask around to find how to do that- then be self-sufficient in the process!  We had to go to the hostess station for a menu, and then go inside to the bar to order and pay.  They did ask where we were sitting, brought it out when it was done and waiters appeared once the order was up to bring the food and condiments.  Food was just OK- 

The real kicker for us was that the prices on the menu for food and beer were not what  we were charged.  Our hamburger was listed at 10.95 but we were charged 11.95- not a huge difference but still annoying.

The real difference came in the beer.  Beers listed on the menu as $5-$6 were actually $7-$8 when you got them!  Again not a big deal seeing as we were so close to the stadium, but still annoying.  Why print a menu price if it's not correct???

If the tables had been clean, the place more organized, and the menu pricing reflecting the actual prices- the whole experience would have been different for us.  
The place is convenient if you are meeting someone before a game, but I can honestly say we will not be returning!"	1.0

~Fud/Drink~
I must admit, I did not try food when I went. Reason being, it was pretty expensive, and I had already stretched the ol' budget for the tickets I got. I saw some people's items, and yes it does beat what you get in the stadium, but just by a little. Quality is that of a normal sports bar. I have seen much better. As for drinks, wow, so priced up. I get it, I do. They have to to make ends meet. But seriously, $6.50 for a pint? Plus, its just general across the board, so from Stella to Budweiser....its $6.50. It once again beats inside, but why bother? There is a place right down the corner that is about half this price.....hmm I wonder where...read on...

~Atmosphere/Service~
Just like the old Sliders here, nothing much has changed. Its a nice wide open space with two levels to choose from. The outdoor patio is inviting, even in hot weather there are misters and a good amount of room to bring a group of friends. There is not much ambiance to the place, the bar area itself is wide open with a couple TV's and long bar. Not an abundance of flare or items on walls. As for service, I can only attest to the barkeeps. They were very attentive, although I went very early to the game and was one of the few there...it wasn't hard to serve me. Each of the individuals I worked with were talkative and fun, and were prompt when I asked to close out.


Extras/Rating~
Two stars are provided for location to ballpark and friendly service. I truly feel that this is place is a trap for out-of-towners. They  come to see their team and did not check it out in advance or ask the motel/hotel where to go pre-game. I went for the Orioles series, and at the first game, there was a sea of orange here. The next game, they all realized to go to another location...I did as well. For better deals, including HAPPY HOUR PRICES, go to Coach's Corner, just a stone's throw away on Jefferson. Prices for food and drinks are much cheaper, along with comparable service. I rarely shout out another business on a review, but seriously, do not waste your money for beer, it makes no sense. I see redeeming factors if you have a super large group of friends wanting a quick beer or two before/after the game. Besides that, skip Game Seven Grill and choose from a ton of other bars in the area."	2.0

I am used to buying a couple beers at this place outside before Dbacks games and have done so over the years, even as it has changed hands. Prices seem higher this year...in fact, seem about on par with beer prices inside Chase Field. 

Tonight's game was likely the biggest crowd of the year for the Dbacks. I ordered a $6 Bud Light, in the aluminum bottle. The server advised me that they were all out of Bud Light in the bottles. That was at 5:40 pm - an hour-and-a-half before the game. Really? If I am going to get fleeced for a $6 bottle of beer, the least they can do is have it in stock! I opted for the $7 Bud Light draft and soon regretted that I had dropped any money at this place. 

I am done with this place. As mentioned, their prices are now about the same as inside the stadium. At least I know Chase Field is well stocked."	0.0

2 drinks and a quesadilla appetizer ended up 25 bucks.

Bbq quesadilla was dry but came with salsa. 
Probably better to just sit outside and grab your own beer from the little tent.

We grabbed a beer at the bar in the back because it was less crowded and we were standing in a corner and in front of the stairs that were blocked off from public access anyway but we got yelled at (and I literally mean yelled at) to move because that area wasn't for standing room. (Like I said, I go often and we actually always stand on that side of the bar and it's always pretty crowded so I don't even think that's a rule.) So, we moved to the other bar and another guy came over and yelled at us AGAIN! Apparently we were still in the way. We actually tried to ask him where standing room was but he interrupted us and said either get out of the way and go outside. He was treating a group of 30ish year olds who were half a beer in like we were rowdy college kids causing a scene! It was really obnoxious. I don't think I can bring myself to give money when they treated us like they didn't even want us there.	1.0

The manager/general manager (short haired guy running around with NO customer service skills) almost threw us out because we were sitting without menus in front of us and thought we ""snuck"" in.  I pointed to the front hostess stand and explained he should be talking to the hostess instead of making my group feel like criminals for sitting there. We were hungry otherwise that would of been the end of that.
     The  tables that were available were outside... We started with a table in the shade, but after a 1:45 minute meal we were in DIRECT sunlight. by the end....Umbrellas would have been a nice touch...especially in AZ. 
    The people at the BENCH next to us had an issue with the red bench paint transferring to their clothes.  This same manager explained that he does not MAKE the benches, he runs a restaurant.  Our table, their table and other tables in earshot could not believe the explanation he was giving them. To his credit he discounted their bill, but definitely made an uncomfortable situation worse.......AGAIN

Sat ourselves down and waited for someone to come over. There was only but maybe 10 people in here may I add. Finally after waiting 15 minutes did someone come over and asked us if we wanted something to drink. Bartender with Arizona hat on saw us and said nothing either to us. Server finally brought us our drinks and asked us if we were ready to order. Told her we didn't have a menu. She stated that's it right there in front of you with literally just wings and pizza on it. Completely disappointed in this place. The owner should be ashamed of his staff here.

Cold beer, average wings/burgers. Honestly, most people would never go if not for the location. But the location is perfect, so it's usually pretty full on game days.

Joke of a menu, bad food, bad service, bad atmosphere, overpriced. 

My husband and I came here for dinner and a beer before the game, and it was the worst. The service was timely enough, but the server couldn't answer any of our questions. I asked if the Schreiner's sausage was served whole, like a hot dog, or shaved on a hamburger bun. ""I'm not sure, sorry."" Okay.... We also asked if they had XX Lager or amber, and she said amber. I thought it was weird because the lager is so common, but dismissed it...until I saw someone walk away from the bar with a lager. Then, when she came back to take our order, the busser walked by and she flat out interrupted my husband in order to tell the busser something, to which he replied that the lady at another table needed a refill. It was...awkward. Especially because the restaurant wasn't even busy! In keeping with the theme, our server came and dropped the check, picked it up, and brought it back without ever speaking a word to us. 

So, anyway, I got nachos ($12?!). The chicken that came on them was like rubber, and in huge long pieces that needed to be cut to fit into a bite. Nachos are not a fork and knife friendly food. The cheese sauce was gross and the chips were hard, and the sour cream was a laughable little squeeze. My husband got the 3 pulled pork sliders ($10), which came without sauce which is weird, and on dry bland buns. The fries were okay. We left well over half our food untouched. It's a disappointing way to waste $40, especially when there are so many great places close by.

I would only suggest coming here for a drink before the game if everywhere else is packed and you MUST be right by the gates."	4.0

Cons: Atmosphere is super lame, not as hip as Slider's was. It's more like going to a Chili's rather than a cool sports bar, hard to get pumped for the game there. The beer selection is limited, that's fine I usually drink domestics at sporting events. Wont find a IPA or a STOUT here though.  Staff is friendly but lacking enthusiasm. The old school Slider's Shot Girls and Beer Girls were much quicker and easier to order from (no waiting for you drink to arrive). Live music is okay but might be better post-game. The crowd seems to respond better to newer music to get pumped/ excited.  Food is fine, I had the nachoes there once, a lil' over priced but that's cause of the location.

Our food (2 pulled pork sandwiches and 1 brisket sandwich) took 45 minutes to arrive at our table after ordering. Besides the food being mediocre, the waitress wasn't very attentive to our needs and told us she didn't even want to live in Pheonix anymore, which probably attributed to her lack of caring. There was a short wait because it was an hour and a half before the game started which we understood. After the hostesses finally put their cell phones down and decided to help seat us, they informed us of an upstairs bar and seating that had no wait. It wasn't until we got up there that they told us it was a limited menu (which was fine.. we had a beer while we waited for another table downstairs).. But why bother having all that space if you aren't going to serve a full menu?? The bartenders shared their displeasure, as I probably would too, because of the potential sales/money they were losing out on by serving a VERY small portion of the menu. We felt bad for them because they were very nice and attentive and deserved better. I didn't mention that we had a member of our party who is disabled on crutches before they led us on the journey upstairs. I would never eat here again but it might be a decent pre-game drinking environment on the patio before the game. Maybe next visit.. until then, I'll stick to Padres games in SoCal!

All because they know, no matter what people will return because its closest to the stadium. The hostess was nice. The waiter was okay, seemed to be stuck w too many tables. The food was cafeteria food. Not worth it. Sadly this review won't change much but if you don't really care and only need a quick beer and crap food, this is definitely your place!	0.0

Servers were running around like crazy, driving people to the bar to close out or get drinks. Similarly, bartenders could not multitask. It was awkward to watch as the two bartenders looked lost working at snail speed or they would form into pods with whom looked like mgmt for minutes at a time. It took me 10 mins to get a beer. The group of three next to me wanted to cash out to get into the game. That started to build up tension as staff ignored them. Lost out on sales. Multiple groups stopped by next to me to grab a quick drink, all of who just left, went into the game because they didn't want to wait any longer. To add, the bartender didn't know where basic bottles were or if you had them. Lost money! And finally, you are a place right next to a pro baseball stadium and you don't have the MLB package or at least sporting events on all the tv's? I asked about a certain game which I received a swift ""no"", and left with nothing. Not an offer to change the channel. There was an R rated movie on with explicit subtitles playing on multiple tv's. I couldn't believe it at first. What the heck are you guys doing? I'm guessing because you are next to the stadium, you believe you will make sales regardless of quality of staff and product. Disappointing business portfolio. I won't ever be spending my money here again. The bud light tasted like bud light. That's a positive."	0.0

We were seating promptly since the Restaurant was pretty much empty. Our servers name was Carlos and he seemed friendly enough. Most of their food had really sweet barbecue sauce but it was edible. Within an hour the restaurant pretty much filled up. Our server forgot about us and treated us like an inconvenience for ordering drinks, which he kept forgetting to bring.

We decided to move outside to the patio so we didn't have to sit at the table any longer. We split the bill and one of us was charged with the whole thing so they got paid twice. We brought this to the servers attention. He reran the card but when our card cleared we were still charged the full amount. That was a week ago.

Since then I have contacted the restaurant multiple times. I finally spoke with the male manager whom informed me that it wasn't his job and I would have to contact accounting.  He didn't take down any of my info he just gave me another number to a lady that wouldn't be in the office for another five days. 

Since I have been playing phone tag with her. I am still waiting for someone to take my info and I can't get my money back. DON'T eat here... Unless you like crappy service, crappy management, and crappy accounting!!! This is the service industry! I would expect to be treated with some hospitality!!!"	0.0

First of all, right when you walk in the door you can tell that none of the employees care about their jobs. The hostess ignored my husband and I for atleast 5 minutes, which would be understandable if it was busy, but it was not. Once we finally got seated the dining side was a mess. It literally looked like a tornado had blown through. Again, this would be forgivable if it was packed but there were very few people in the dining area. Our server was very rude and seemed like she couldn't care less about what we wanted. I will however give props to the kitchen, the food came out very quickly and tasted pretty good.

2078	qGf1wupj-UwG15fzQ7b-SA	0.0	0.0	1.0	"Day after Christmas so everywhere was crazy busy.  As I asked for the wait time, your hostess was super annoyed with the high stress environment, and stated if we want to ""check out"" the bar area for a high top table we could just walk in, but the wait was ""a long time"". I asked about sitting outside, she stated, let me check to see if we have a server willing to work outside.  (Two tables were already situated outside.) She put our name on the list for dining area to be safe.  25 minutes go by, and I went inside to ""check"" if we could be seated outside. She then openly asks a server who is at the drink station or counter nearby if he can ""handle"" a party of 6. He looks at her frustrated and says, ""I already have 3 tables, but whatever!"".  She then looks at me and says, ""you can sit outside if you want he will take you.""  ""UHHHHH....NO? After seeing the way he was with even getting more patrons, do you think I want to sit in his area?"" 

At this point, people in the waiting area see this, and LEAVE. I mentioned to her how it's probably not a great idea to openly ask your team if they can ""handle"" anything. 

I just tell her we will look for a table top in the bar.  Found a table, the manager who looks tired as all get out, takes our drink orders.  The waitress who had us was pleasant but overwhelmed clearly.  Drinks took 20 minutes and food was almost 45 minutes to receive. Most of anyone who was working were agitated and overwhelmed. You hostess was clearly inexperienced, she was a very young lady who even said a couple of times out loud, ""I'm about to have a break down"". Why is this individual even in the front? She is your restaurant's liaison for new and returning patrons.  It just makes for a bad dynamic for the customer. Having worked in this industry, I am understanding to how busy it can get.  To include your server who was in front of customers complaining of how he had enough ""tables"".  Watch who you hire! Some may be good for the hustle but not for customer service!

We sat our self at the self sea5 bar. We waited over 15min before we were even acknowledge, mind you there was only one other table. I asked about there drink menus she had absolutely no knowledge I had to walk over to the bartender to order the drink that I wanted. My friends my waited over 30 minutes for our food and when it came out it was wrong. I ordered there breaded chicken wrap with the tie jerk sauce the chicken I had absolutely no sauce. My server was nowhere around so I had to stop and ask a manager how to fix my order. Even then when it came back out there was barely any sauce in my wrap. I have to ask multiple times for a side of the jerk chicken sauce and ranch finally I just asked the manager because I knew she would bring it out. It took another 15 minutes for a waiter to even stop by after you finish eating to be able to pay for our tab. She had to be reminded multiple times to bring back take away boxes. She forgot to bring back art to go Pepsi after we asked over 3 different times so then again I went and got the manager and she did it for me. She also forgot to bring back our change and soon to keep it so then again I had to ask the manager for it back my overall experience was just horrible this used to be one of my favorite spot stop in for a few drinks and wings but I don't think I'll be returning because of this.

My roommates and I came Sunday evening to grab dinner and the restaurant was not busy at all. We were seated immediately but we waited about 15 min for our server to come take our drink order. There was plenty of other staff members who could have helped but instead they were all standing in the front just talking with each other.  It would have been nice if the servers helped one another and grabbed drinks for the tables. But I guess the conversation they were having was way more important then serving the customers.

I saw the hostess throw her arms up in exasperation when I didn't get served. I kept leaning over and staring at all the servers but no one ever came to the patio. I waited for a full 15 minutes. As I was walking out the door I noticed a manager there, so I called the restaurant. When I explained the situation to him, he gave me an apathetic response of ""I'm sorry."" Now I work in upper management and I thought it was weird that he didn't say anything else...just silence. So I said ""You don't seem very concerned."" He came back with  ""I am, it's too bad you don't come back."" Or something to that effect. Honestly trust the other reviews. Depending on the day you go (esp if the manager is there) total nightmare. Honestly it should be the opposite. If a manager's on site everybody should be hustling. Anybody who has had poor service, I recommend complaining to corporate.

We patiently waited as it was a playoff night for NBA and many large tables were being held by 1-2 people for their party to show up. Fine. It's a big night for NBA playoffs. 

The manager assured we'd be sat soon despite the rush. A waitress also came over and let us know they were cleaning off the booth for us, a family of 5 that was willing to squeeze in. As we are watching them clean the table, two young gentleman walk in, who expressed sitting in the bar. As they were walking towards the bar area, ""Kassondra"" greeted the gentleman, as if it were common occurrence, as they walked by and she proceeded to ask how many was with their group. The kid responded with ""2"" and she goes ""okay, let me see what I can do"". She struts over to the booth they were cleaning for us and she starts to clean it as all the other waitresses turn and look and ask what she is doing. She claims that she's giving the booth to the other two gentleman who just walked in. The waitress who told us that they were getting it ready fought her case and said it was for us. Kassondra shrugged her shoulders and said she is giving it to the two young kids that just walked in.  The waitress turned around rolled her eyes and had to be the one to explain to the other hostess and manager what Kassondra was doing as they all looked confused as to why.

This was so ridiculous that we just left as the manager claims these two kids were just waiting outside, which is a blatant lie considering the conversation I just heard between all of them. Not only is it ridiculous how unorganized this place has become over the last year, but then the manager treats his customers like they're stupid, even when the customers were standing 2 feet away from the conversation with all the facts.

I ordered both dry rub and wet rub wings that had barely any sauce on them to begin with. Then the onion rings I ordered were far from onion rings. They served me onion rings that were the peeling of the onion, not the actual onion inside. Then to make matters even worse when I asked to speak with the manager, he informed me that he was sorry but it was not their fault and that all of their food with the exception of the original hot wings are frozen and re heated showing little empathy. He did refund me for the $6 worth for maybe all of the 5 frozen onion rings I received which I thought was nice however I will never be going to Buffalo Wild Wings ever again after learning their food is just re heated frozen food. If I wanted cheap frozen wings and tasteless side dishes I would go to the grocery store and receive better quality.	0.0

I'm already not really a fan because for having the word ""Wings"" in their name the wings here are mediocre at best and absolutely over priced. However, a few of my coworkers like to grab lunch here so I occasionally join them. The first few times we were waiting between 25-35 minutes to get our food barely leaving enough time to actually eat it before heading back to the office.  To offset this issue we got smart and started asking for the check as soon as the food arrived so everything could be paid for by the time we were finished eating. This solution was working for us but apparently they've been getting complaints because today they had a digital timer on the table. Our waitress explained that she would start the timer when we ordered and the food would be at our table within 15 minutes or it was free. Okay, I thought, they've got this issue figured out.  Wrong!  Once the timer hit the 15 minute mark in large letters on the screen it read ""Times Up"".  Still no food on our table so we all looked at each other and shrugged figuring we just got a free meal. When our food does arrive the waitress quickly scoops up the timer puts down our food and disappears. So, we eat and go about enjoying our lunch until eventually the waitress arrives with our bill.  Well, this is an awkward moment. We can either pay for food that should be free or basically accuse our waitress of being a liar. We chose the later and had a free lunch today.  The problem with all this is that if they would staff up appropriately people might actually get their lunch in a timely manner. I absolutely don't blame our waitress for this even though she tried to pull a fast one. It's really managements fault for not staffing up enough. Pretty sure the next time my coworkers suggest this place I'll either decline or suggest a different location.  #notimpressed"	0.0

I was able to get a table no problem, and the server came out pretty quickly. But it went downhill from there. Once I ordered, it took a really long time to get my food. Then, when it did come out, half of my order was wrong. So I had to wait again to get the rest of my order. My food was delivered to my table in three separate trips. No apology for the wait, no discount. So I finally finish my food, get a to-go box for the half of my order that was received last so I'd already eaten the rest of it, and pay. Then when my transaction hits my bank, I realized they'd overcharged me. There were two transactions for BWW on my bank account instead of one. Just a bad experience all around. I won't be back.	2.0

My friends and I ordered all wings, all 6 of us. The food runner, bless her heart, attended to us more than Richard. Richard was a ""Dick"". He is lucky we even tipped.
This rating only got 2 stars because the wings were great. Had a lot of sauce on them and were well cooked.

But I always leave so disappointed in their customer service, all three times we've been here there's a ton of staff walking around and I always seem to be waiting forever to get service. No hellos, no how's everything, nothing, it looks like they spend more time chatting with each other than trying to impress the customers so we can come back. Anyone who knows me well knows I'm a great tipper, but not if I get poor service, I work in the industry so it saddens me when I see bad customer service like we did here, there are so many opportunities to make someone's day, even if it's not your table, just say hi, but it's like we were bothering them for coming in.

After pointing this out to the waitress, she informed us that they no longer had a grill...and everything is fried. Period. You have a restaurant.... your main food is chicken wings and you don't have a grill? Disgusting disgusting disgusting. After an hour my stomach was upset and I felt like I was going to heave.

It's almost comical so we decided to stay and see if they were just bustin our chops. Well the waitress came in a timely manner which changed the sour taste I had for this specific establishment, but then we ordered food...big mistake. I felt like we were burdens to our waitress, she didn't even bother writing down our order which of course meant we got served wrong type of sides. Fine, but to see her chatting it up with male patrons made me upset especially since we waited over 22 minutes (clock at the bar told me) for our Luke warm food really pissed me off. She seemed upset when we asked for our correct order but then again it could've just been her face since I didn't see her crack a smile whatsoever with us. They weren't even busy so that couldn't have been an excuse for the bad service, I just know I won't come to this BWW again.

We asked if we could move and the host just moved the A/C a foot over. We said we're not sitting there and he sat us in a booth. When we sat down in the seats, they sank down about 4 inches. Haha. Instead of requesting another table again, we decided it would be fine. There were 3 of us and we ordered our food. The waitress got my sister's order wrong. Of course we realized this when the wings were brought out. She said it would take 10 minutes for them to cook up the right order. We shared our food with my sister, but it took about 25 minutes for her food to come out. When things like this happen, I don't usually expect anything other than an apology. A discount is nice if they offer it, but not necessary. Anyway, the waitress didn't apologize about getting the order wrong nor for the time it took for the correct order to come out.

So we are really easy when we order. We get the same thing every time. We order our drinks, tell our waiter, Mark, we can order our food and we do. We order medium boneless wings and start listing four sauces.....
Lately there has been a little bit of confusion for which sizes get how many sauces. Most locations give 4 sauces with a medium boneless wings. 
Mark stated that we can only have 3 sauces for a medium. I mentioned that that was odd because other locations do 4. He stated that since the other locations are franchises, they don't follow the same rules... and then they weigh the chicken, depending on the weight and amount of wings in each pound, they decide on the number of sauces.... this seemed a bit unbelievable...
Regardless, we were forced to size up. And we asked for them to be wet. When we got our order , we which we did get pretty promptly (only positive note) two of our groups of wings barely had any sauce on them.

Forget sitting outdoors on the patio because there is one of those splash fountains that attract screaming little brats like flies to you know what.

Came in during lunch. Wasn't busy by any means but yet still waited over 45 minutes for 4 simple orders of wings.  

Service was ok. Wasn't terrible considering she was training someone but could have been better, she didn't even acknowledge the fact that our order was taking longer than usual other than it'll be right out. When clearly that wasn't the case.  . 

Once our order came. The wings lacked all flavor.  I ordered Medium and Honey Chipotle and medium just tasted like breaded chicken breast.  The honey chipotle, same bread in with a drizzle of syrup style sauce.  

Can't say I would come back unless it was extremely convenient."	1.0

The rest are there for a paycheck, and probably think that they should get a good tip because they have skimpy clothes and most guys are desperate and fawn all over them.  Nothing worse than self-entitlement.  

People go out for entertainment.  And part of your job as a waiter/waitress is to be outgoing, to socialize.  The couple of girls that waited on me seem lack this skill.  

The most annoying thing about this place is the ""We ID everyone regardless if they are on an oxygen tank, in a wheel chair, full head of grey hair, more creases and wrinkles than a Sharpe (dog) and wearing a World War I hat.""  Seriously?  How stupid.  I'm not going back simply because of such stupidity.  Next is their over priced beers.  $5 dollars for a 16 oz beer?  Ridiculous.  There's TONS of places that have more to offer than this chain on both beer and food, and at a better price.  If you want an awesome variety of beers, check out the Whining Pig or Pigs Meow."	1.0

Tonight, just like every other Friday night, I met with my teammates at your location in Mesa before our softball game for Happy Hour. We all ordered our food and drinks from that menu uneventfully. Our orders took longer than usual to come out, but I attributed that to it being Friday. When the check was eventually presented to us, my girlfriend noticed that everything on the bill was being charged at full price, not the prices from the Happy Hour menu that we ordered from. When we brought this to Shannon (our waitress)'s attention, she talked to her manager and then said that she needed to take back 2 of my girlfriend's sliders (half of her food), because ""the happy hour sliders come with 2, and 4 come with the standard menu"", so we could only have 2. To actually TAKE FOOD BACK FROM A PAYING CUSTOMER'S PLATE took an incredible lack of judgement. Of course, we asked to speak with a manager, and when Sherri (who claimed to be a manager) came over to our table, she incredulously repeated the same line about the different menus, etc...saying that they were following their ""policy""  when taking the food back. No one at your establishment demonstrated the smallest bit of customer service or basic tactfulness when dealing with us. Eventually, the manager came back with the 2 infamous sliders in a box, saying that we could take them with us. Obviously, at this point, it is not about the food. It was never about the food! Our experience was embarrassing, humiliating, and infuriating. I will tell everyone I know about the poor customer service my group received, and I am sure, as you can tell by now, my group will never be back to your restaurant. We will take all of our business elsewhere. You can thank Shannon for not understanding how to take an order and Sherri's lack of basic customer service for that."	2.0

My server did NOT do the best nor greatest job of customer service (emphasizing this, as this is a key factor here). This is what happened to me, as the following occured during my servers' service of ignorance (she never once wanted to acknowledge me), during her shift:

1) She took 10-15 minutes to take my order
2) She never refilled my lemonade, so I had a different server do that for me
3) She took 5-10 minutes to get me my check

In between what my server did, she sat at a table with three to four different people, and I saw her do this at least two to four separate times. I had to get up, at least three times, just to get her attention to help me out. I did use a stopwatch to time the service, because I was getting the stiffed ignored & denied treatment from my server. At this point, the customer service was getting both ridiculous & out of hand. 

I didn't like nor appreciate what this Hooters location did to their former regular customer. The story gets very interesting, hence the plot thickens, & I got kicked out three weeks later by management during a pageant party. This was all because I used a stopwatch to time the service, and I complained to the Hooters in Georgia about my service of ignorance during my servers shift. 

Remember, & keep in mind that my server did NOT do the best nor greatest job of customer service (emphasizing this, as this is a key factor here). Management at this location has not wanted to lift my ban, and don't want me back at all, because I used a stopwatch to time the service, & complained to the Hooters in Georgia about my customer service experience. I did try talking to management, but this problem has not been resolved, & now, this Hooters has lost my business as a former regular customer. 

If I could give this location any lower than one star, it would be - 5 stars, for the service I received only for that day alone, the not-so-appreciated gratitude of respect and no friendly gesture from the management for kicking me out. I have realized for the past six months that this was a bad experience with a not-so-attentive server, that gave me an overall terrible service on a slow day she decided to ignore me.  

If you have read this far into my review, please know that I have not made any of this up, as I tell the truth here. If you want better customer service, go to Tilted Kilt, Twin Peaks, or for great quality chicken wings, Buffalo Wild Wings. After what happened to me, almost one year ago, I will say this: I highly recommend NOT going to this Hooters."	1.0

And last night was the situation to tip the scale making me decide to probably not ever go back.  I was charged for 2 extra drinks which I did not order.  Me and a acquaintance were out on the patio enjoying some drinks and winning our night out when a some guy came had a conversation with us about California and where he grew up.  Then all of a sudden a waitress comes out asked us if we wanted another round which I said no as we were going to be living their shortly.  The guy from California says yeah give them another round and put it on my tab so I look at the waitress and I still told her no we are good.  Then the guy goes back in and 20 minutes later the waitress comes out saying I was told to bring these out.  So at the moment I told her I already closed out my tab and she said I don't know and left the drinks.  So I figure at that moment that the guy decided to have them put the 2 drinks on his tab.  So we drank them thinking the drinks were taken care of and before we finished the drinks another waitress comes out with a check for me.  Now I don't know what kind of scam they are trying to push but I'm pretty sure I'm not going to stop in there again.  I should call the manager to report the incident which I might do	0.0

My friend and I decided to go to Hooters tonight. I had never been to Hooters prior and was excited to try them for the 1st time. I had heard amazing things about their chicken wings.

Well we got there and due to a basketball game (Warriors), it was a busy night. We waited 40 minutes to be seated. After we were finally seated, we ordered our food and waited another 40 minutes for our food to be served. When we received our boneless chicken wings, they were cold and dry. Worst part was that they barely had any sauce on them. We still ate them because we were starving after waiting almost an hour and a half. We also received our sliders. The sliders were also cold and the bread was kind of hard. We had to wait a few minutes for our curly fries which was probably the best part of our meal as they were fresh.
I finished my drink and our waitress not once attempted to refill my drink. I even put the cup at the edge of the table hoping she would notice.

I must say, I don't know what the hype is about. I was really disappointed. Yeah, they have pretty waitresses but the food sucks and the service sucks. I would have been better off going to In and Out down the street. Definitely will not return."	1.0

We ordered our drinks and I asked her if they have Lactose-free Milk even soy milk, she said YES with a smile and brought back our drinks. This time my husband asked her again, if the milk was lactose free. And this time she said no why? Wow, no apologies for lying to me the first time and no aplogies for almost giving son something he is allergic to. She left and took about ten minutes to return and take our order. We got our appetizer (lots of tots) in a fair amount of time but she didnt bring appetizer plates for our table so we just ate off our napkins. our entrees took a long time to be brought out, she even had time to dance around and sing happy birthday to someone.  By the time our food came out, all our fries were cold and stiff. My son ordered the hamburger kids meal and his patty was cold!! I was so unhappy and upset by now. She didn't even refill our drinks. We had to ask another server for refills which she in turn said she will get our server. Our serve came to our table an extended amount of time again and only refilled half our tables drinks. She swooped around so fast and left I tried asking for my refill. Again we had to ask another server for our check once we were ready to leave and sitting around. She brought the check and did not take our kids meal discount off since we dined on Saturday when kids eat free. I did ask her and she said the computer automatically takes the discount off at the end and multiples it. I didn't believe her, I did the math myself, and no Discount was applied. She lied again!! She brought out a second reciept with a partial discount applied. At this point I just wanted to leave!!! I'm never bringing my family or friends to this location again. I'm pretty sure our food sat out for an extended amount of time before she brought it over because after our experience 2 of us became ill soon after.

We were seated quickly and the waitress was friendly but that doesn't make for a great eating experience. First the menu is very limited and EVERYTHING!! is ala'cart.
Even down to celery and ranch or blue dressing for your wings really? On Wednesday is all you can eat wings $12.99 I went with that naked not breaded and the wife ordered the steamed shrimp 1/2 pound for $10.99 mind you that's all, it doesn't come  fries or salad $5 more for a side salad. Our food came out rather quick but my wings were breaded NOT naked, Hmm by design? Fill you up on the breading means less wings they have to bring out. 
   a third of the way through the meal my wife found a shrimp that wasn't de-vained , rather unappetizing, my wife brought it up to the waitress she said she sorry and would let the manager know. Manager never came by then my drink needed filling didn't get filled. A few minutes later she came back and asked if I would like to put another order in (unlimited wings) I said no thank just a box to go please. 5 to 7 minutes later she comes back, would like some more wings?

Our server was good, personable and got everyone's order correct. She was a little slow, but it was fairly busy, and she apologized for it. The food was what you'd want and expect from Denny's. Nothing to report there.

I mentioned the rapidly deteriorating bathroom conditions to the hostess *again* when my kids used the bathroom after we ordered, before our food came. She said, ""They're really busy in the back.""

I replied, ""So, just bc they're busy in the back customers have to be subjected to a dirty bathroom?"" She came back with, ""Well, I'm not cleaning any damn bathroom."" I just shook my head and walked away.

When we used the restroom one last time before we left, it was even worse, and no one had even attempted to tidy it up at any time, even though there were 3 Hostesses and 2 Cashiers standing right there, as well as two servers I saw in there using the bathroom during two of our trips to the bathroom."	1.0

Anyway I asked for fries as an appetizer and she said she would put it down . 10 minutes later another server asks if we are ready to order. I said yes but can you check on our fries? She didn't know anything about it and asked the cook Eric if he put fries down.... Blank look from him.  We order 2 spaghetti and waiting 20 min later our order gets put in the waiter and the cook is dinging his bell. The waitress Tammie yells.... I'm stuck at the register Eric! Anyway, our order is dying in the window for like 10 min. I actually had to raise my voice and ask if that was order dying in the window. Tammie goes to the food and asks the cook if he was going to put mushrooms on the spaghetti. IT WAS NOT EVEN READY!!  When it finally got to us it had this giant mass of meat piled atop the the pasta and sauce . I'm not usually one to complain about Too much meat but this greasy meat just ruined an otherwise passable pasta dish .

I left to go outside for about 5 minutes (to attempt to place an order elsewhere)  but when I was told how long it would take for that order to be ready I decided to go back inside.  The same little boy was STILL standing there. I Stood there for another 5 minutes waiting for someone to acknowledge me when a lady came by and helped a gentleman who arrived after me.

I wouldn't even call it chinese food. Some fond memories I have of this place, are waiting for an hour or more for our food to arrive, once almost two hours. I remember once opening the packaging and where we had ordered fried wontons were not fried wontons, but what was apparently tortilla chips. I remember once I took a bite of some chicken and mushroom dish, can't remember what it was called- and tasting dirt- literally, it tasted like dirt. As if whatever type of mushroom they used they had not even bothered to wash the dirt off of before making the food, and like there was grains of dirt or sand mixed in with the food. Some of the most bland, gross food ever. Seriously I would not have been surprised to have learned of health code violations at this place. I've never been inside of it, only driven paast, and the only reason I ever tried it was again because they were the only ones who delivered to my area around there. After ordering twice, I never ordered again. I've posted multiple reviews about how bad the food is and encouraged nobody to eat or order food here, but they are removed consistently, so I think the only way this place stays in business is by paying yelp to remove them.	0.0

The inside of this restaurant is a little scary and pretty dark. I've never really seen anyone eating in here. They do have a little fish tank with some big fish swimming around in circles and looking for attention. I get hungry just watching them.

Most of their menu is your typical American style Chinese and nothing that would be considered authentic or what they really eat overseas. It is hard to find the real stuff and when you do they end up closing.

Always order the Volcano Beef and have them make it extra spicy. The House Lo Mein is also very good and my wife seems to enjoy that one the best. Usually upgrade to some Fried Rice to take things up to the next level.

This place is probably best for a night of heavy drinking and getting it delivered to the house. The food is ok but the prices are higher than other places with a similar menu. The delivery times can also vary depending the crew that is working that night.

More or less this place is a Meh experience with slight touches of A-OK. The best part is you will have some tasty leftovers the next day to work off any type of party residuals. BEER ME!

Arrived at 5:30pm with a friend, and decided to sit in the patio because the weather was nice and the patio was empty. We wait for 15-20 mins and the waiter asks us if we wanted to order. We order our beer and an appetizer, and 10 mins later my friend gets hers and I get my taster. I ordered my actual beer, and then another 15 mins my beer comes and the waiter says, ""on the house because we took so long."" Cool, right?! 

Finally 6:20 rolls around and we should have food by now, right? Wrong! We ask the waiter about it. He says, ""Oh, I'll go check on it!"" But I mention that he didn't ask what flavor of wings we wanted, then he says, ""I'm not gonna lie, I didn't enter it in."" WOW! So he lied to my face. He says sorry, but you know it's the fake sorry. Waiter of 19 years old doesn't care. Then I mention I want to talk to a manager, and he says ok. 

A lady at the bar then proceeds to tell me that the manager acted completely rude to her, but also didn't really care what she or other patrons had to say about the service. We saw several customers leaving who were waiting on just drinks. 

Talk about horrible customer service.  

I experienced this the first time I was here but figured it was because they had just opened up (this was 2 weeks after their opening). This is now MONTHS after they opened and the service is still horrendous. They were completely dead when we arrived so there wasn't a reason for the slow or inattentive service.

We rode bikes here yesterday to give it a second chance. It was even worse sitting at a table in the bar area. After waiting 20 minutes for a server, the sulking woman behind the bar agreed to give us a cup of water to hold us over. The water was served up along with a side of hard looks and eye rolling. Both times that we came here, I felt like I  had wronged the entire staff on a personal level, but I'm pretty sure we never any of them met before. To our surprise, the wings were better than average, but not worth the 45 minute wait or the miserable corporate atmosphere of this place .

It's easy for a big party to meet here. The food truck concept and beer and wine wall are also great ideas. The execution and service, however are AWFUL. 1) We were in for a Sunday night dinner and drinks before an event. The place wasn't too busy but everything took FOREVER. There was a line for seemingly no reason at the main bar. 2) The beer wall concept NEEDS to be fixed. Why do I have to pre-purchase a certain amount? You are limiting your sales. Make it so that I can take what I want and just charge me at the end. Z Pizza does this about 4 blocks away and it is MUCH better. We were told we had to put money on a card in advance. So we had to guess how much we wanted to drink. Then, we were told we can get any money back we didn't use. When we went to do this at the end, the server complained and says that ""no one ever does this,"" and it took FOREVER. 3) The food on both my trips into the Park took FOREVER AND came out cold. Last night we had a Lobster Mac and Cheese that came out literally chilled. Our other food was also lukewarm. 4) Back to the beer wall- fix the foam issue. I know how to pour beer and your CO2 must be off because the head on each glass is way too much. 5) Back to the food: The line to order food was about 10 people long and it took about 20 minutes just to order. That is WAY too long. I eat out in the central phoenix area 4-5 nights a week, and this has been my worst experience. They really need to figure it out."	1.0

Open seating like always, but who the hell was our server?! NO ONE KNEW!!!! After sitting for a while I was told by a lady that they were looking for a server for us. I looked over at the bar to see one see pointing at us and talking with 2 other servers and he kept pointing. At this moment stop pointing and just freaking take our order!!! Another server started to clean a table next to us picks up 3 glasses walks past us and say we will be right with you...is it really that hard to take a freaking drink order, COME ON!!!!! Finally some one out of the group of servers comes and apologizes saying that they have no idea who our server is and that she will help us. THANK GOD!! She says we have an amazing beer wall, sells us on that and finishes with I will be right back with waters. She comes back with the waters and I ask for 3 passes to the beer wall, her response...""I'm off, you're server will be right with you."" WTF?!?!?! You just told us you don't know who our server is, so instead of taking our order starting the tab and handing it off, this awesome server leaves and makes us wait for ""our server"". There was a manager lady that had permanent bitch smile standing behind us and another dude playing with himself over by the back of he restaurant not helping serve the busy floor or finding our ghosted server. Who the hell is running this place?? Needless to say without spending a dime we got up and left thanks for ruining an awesome night out.

This place is cool a little unorthodox but has AWESOME potential, get someone in there who knows what the hell they're doing or you're going to be gone in a quick second. It's easy to make first time money but if you don't have returning money you'll be f***ed in the off season of the surrounding sports facilities.

Visit 1 - Wife and I went in at about 10PM on a Friday night. We were just roaming around downtown and decided to pop in for a first look. Place was maybe half full. Took quite a while to get the attention of a bartender, and even longer to get a couple of simple draft beers. There was a band setting/warming up on the stage, so we thought this would be cool. 

After a half hour the band still hadn't started, our beers were empty, and no one asked us if we wanted more beer. We decided to leave and go to Copper Blues instead, since their bands are always playing by 9:30 and we don't have to beg for refills.

On the way out, I asked the doorman why they hired a band that didn't actually play music. He said the band wasn't scheduled to go on until 11. Oh, okay. Cool for them, but I thought I was in Phoenix, not LA.

Visit 2 - My adult daughter and I were on the Urban Wine Walk. We heard at another bar that The Park had recently cleaned house and completely replaced their staff, so I decided to give it another crack. We arrived at about 1:30 to find all the seats at the north bar taken, though mainly by the handbags of the five or six women sitting at the bar. There were plenty of seats at the south bar, but it was closed.

We were directed to a high top table in the north bar area, which was fine. A young man who was apparently a manager asked us a couple of times if we were sure we didn't want a booth and some food menus. We declined, citing the Wine Walk. Eventually a pleasant and friendly server came to take our order. We mentioned we were doing the Wine Walk and she replied that she'd only been told The Park was participating an hour before. She did give us some Wine Walk maps, and we ordered our wine samples.

Fifteen minutes later, still no samples. Our server had been standing at the service bar the entire time, furiously tapping the register screen. Some other Wine Walkers came into the bar and ordered their samples, which the bartender started pouring immediately. We waited five more minutes before we decided to leave without sampling any wine. We went to The Strand and immediately got samples. Now, the Wine Walk is a five-hour event with about 30 restaurants. Waiting around for 20+ minutes just for samples to arrive REALLY cuts into a Wine Walker's time.

The Park's concept is pretty cool, but the execution is sorely lacking. I doubt I'll ever go back. There are many better options in downtown Phoenix."	2.0

They are always out of something food wise and one of the bartenders told us she didn't know how to make certain cocktails so that made us feel really comfortable (eye roll).  I feel sorry for the food trucks that have their names on stuff here because I've had a couple of them outside of this place and they are great but this was not a good representation of any of them. Not impressed at all. The only reason I gave them 2 stars instead of 0 was because of the LED tv. I'll likely take my drinking elsewhere.	0.0

Sat at a bar top for 13 minutes before I was approached. Asked about the 10% discount and any specials included with the event. The waitress checked and said there were no specials or discounts with the event-- I figured what the hell, it's 10%. 
I ordered a miller lite, pulled pork sandwich and Mac & cheese (I had just run a 10k and needed some carbs). 
While I was waiting they made an announcement that the specials for the event included 10% off; a $2 beer, $5 wine and $1 soda. The announcement also said if the waiter doesn't know about he specials ask for a manager and they'll take care of it. 
20 minutes later received my sandwich-- no silverware, no beer, no water refill. Asked for a manager for confirmation of specials while I waited for my beer. 
Waited about 15 minutes and the waitress comes to me and asks if she can get me anything-- since I hadn't touched my sandwich and side. I said, ""the manager, my beer, silverware"" 

The report back was that the manager hadn't shown up yet, and no one had been made aware of the specials (which had been running for 160 weeks). The only manager on duty was the beer manager. The waitress was less than thrilled when I asked; ""if that's the case why don't I have my beer"" 

Overall the service was pretty embarrassing to say the least. I'm shocked the event keeps coming back when the wait staff has no clue what specials they are offering and the manager doesn't even bother to come in. 

The bar is very cool looking but it's clearly a big miss. Very unfortunate. 

I was at my table for a total for 37 minutes. Never received a water refill, my ordered beer or silverware.

The concept of the self serving beer bar is such a great idea.... not so great here, no matter how slow you do the poor and tilt your glass it was 80% foam.  Watched so many people walk away with the same half full glass of foam.  Decided to try a few different mixed drinks and I am pretty sure they forgot to add any liquor.  We told the server and of course told you can't taste the liquor because the mix is sweet.  Hmmm interesting response is all I could think.
Food....eat before you go, I got the three tacos with chips.  Tacos were less than stellar and I have never had chips that were so salty.  Husband had the BBQ which was dry and uneventful.

Drink order was taken at 1140 and the first drinks showed up at 12:15.  35 minutes for 3 tap beers. The 4th drink was 10 minutes after that. Our food order was taken at shortly after our drink order. At 1220 we still had not seen any of our food and we asked for a manager and a gentleman said he could help us. We explained that we had to be at the game but 1:10 and he said he would expedite and work with us on the price. Delivered 1 of our 4 sandwiches and 1 order of appetizers a few minutes later and said he would only charge us for half the food. At 1245 we finally gave up and told him we had to leave. His response was to apologize and said ""even the Patriots have a bad day"".  The waitress was brand new and was very friendly and this was not her fault. Never did see the rest of our food order.

I really like the pour your own beer concept and the pricing is good,  but the table  service for food needs improvement. We had to flag someone down to make an order, and we never did get silverware or plates for our appetizers, so had to hunt down our own napkins. Not sure why they had cage fighting on every tv. Didn't seem to match the atmosphere at all. We got them to switch to the Diamondback game however. This is not a sports bar, but not sure really how to classify it. We ordered wings and a chips and dip appetizer, and they were fine. This place has potential, but they need to get organized.	0.0

First off, we were under the impression this was going to be very different than it turned out to be. Instead of a food truck vibe, think food court. We tried the Frito Pie which was basically just pure salt. And in reading other reviews it sounds like salt is a problem here with many things.  Completely inedible. Also tried one of the tuna dishes. The tuna was incredibly funky and should not have been served. Then we had the safest bet on the menu, kids chicken tenders. But they were completely flavorless....just seems like an item that would be tough to screw up, but not for the Park. The beer wall gimmick was pure foam. We spent $20 on 1.5 beers and had to wait in line for the privilege of getting this card loaded with $ and again to retrieve my ID which they held (or I could have paid $3 for a card to keep). It was just a calamity of errors at every turn....almost laughable it was so awful. Even the play area feels like a poorly executed garage sale. They need to close the place down and reassess everything that they are doing and try again or it's going to be a very short run. My wife asked to speak with a manager which I was not in favor of but she thought it was important since they're new and it would be good for them to know everything that's going wrong. He just looked like a deer in headlights and reading these yelp reviews I now know why. 

They may get a false sense of hope with baseball starting soon but I highly doubt anyone will come to this place more than once so it's only a matter of time."	1.0

I expected an ""outdoor feel"" as it has been advertised; it felt like a rainforest cafe except no talking animals (the best part of rainforest cafe.) There was one fake tree in the middle of the room, but I didn't feel like it was an outdoor bar. 

The ""food trucks"" were not aligned along the bar as I expected. A wall of a menu was behind the cash register where you could order different items from different trucks (ok, kind of cool). Unfortunately, the portion size appeared to be half of what I would get if I had ordered this from the truck itself. 

The bar wall concept is cool. You prepay for a card and can use the card to buy beer by the oz. samplers, pints, whatever. Not enough taps, and half were beers such as coors light, bud light, etc. Wamp waaaaamp. 

It's a new bar, so the servers weren't quite familiar with the menu. I'll let that one slide. 

Other notes: 
Parking is around, but be prepared that everything nearby is metered/pay lots. 

There is a patio that's per friendly! Yay! 

There is giant Jenga, ping pong tables, and other games.

We ordered the buffalo wings, the poutine fries, the tacos and, carne asada nachos. The buffalo wings were overly salted and when we complained about it the server was nice enough to order a different batch for us. Unfortunately, it almost seem like she brought back the same one because they were just as salty as the first batch. The tacos we're so ridiculously small I thought it was play food at first and when I actually ate one, the small tortilla was harder than a chip and stale. The poutine fries were also overly salted. Finally the carne asada nachos not only did it not have carne asada (they came with pork) but the cheese was so cheep I could almost swear they made them with velveeta. For the prices they're charging for the dishes, you would expect to have better quality. When we complained the second time, the waitress was nice enough to bring not only who I believe to be the manager but also the chief. And when we explained everything, he told us that it's supposed to be like lunch truck style food. I then explained to him that I have eaten from lunch trucks and their food was much more superior and cost cheaper than what they were charging and serving us. He then went on to say that all the ingredients and recipes they use are the same as the lunch trucks.  Tossed around what are suppose to be famous cooks names like it would make it better that it was their recipes. I've eaten at many different places and not once have I had food so overly salty and poor quality.  It was so bad that it felt like we might be getting pranked on a hidden camera show.	2.0

The form stated that I'd be contacted right away to confirm. After a week went by and I still did not get a confirmation, I tried RSVPing again via text (another option that was available to which I did not hear back. After countless phone calls and voicemails left, I finally did hear back when I tried my final attempt of emailing the establishment. The email said the Dueling Pianos started at 7 p.m. (as did the advertisement on their Facebook page) and my dinner reservation was confirmed for 6:30 p.m. that evening (October 14th). My date and I arrived at 6:30 to which we found a table right away. The waitress seemed slightly annoyed when we ordered drinks to start and said we would wait for the show to start for our food. Our waitress came by about 15 minutes later and yet again was seemingly annoyed that we didn't place a (food) order yet. A little after 7 p.m., we found out the show wasn't starting until 8 which was a bit discouraging. We ordered our appetizer and dinner to which they came out at the same time (usually one would think the appetizer would come first with some time in between until the main course). After we received our dinner by someone who wasn't our waitress, we rarely saw our waitress the entire night. She wasn't attentive whatsoever and also took our appetizer away before we were finished. In addition, while waiting for the show to start, we noticed that there are typos on multiple ads on The Park's Facebook page which just shows poor professionalism. 

When the Dueling Pianos finally started at about 8 p.m., we were relieved yet apprehensive. The show ended up being great and the two musicians were fantastic. Their personalities and ability to improv was so great!

We like to arrive to venues very early to beat the crowd, so we got here early afternoon and were able to get a table for two. It took a few minutes just to be greeted. It took even longer for our server to bring our waters and two menus. We had been there about 30 minutes before we were able to put our food order in. During the wait for our food, our server never came back to our table to refill glasses. I had ordered a beer and decided to walk to the beer garden to have it refilled since our server disappeared. The beer garden however was out of about a third of the beers on tap. (Letdown.) 

There was live music playing which was great, and for a time kept our minds off of how long our food was taking. We kept seeing plates coming out of the kitchen, none of which were ours. Tables that had been sat after us had been served while we hadn't. What's worse is we saw the food runners bring plates out to tables not knowing where they were going. One guy put a plate down on a table, the patron touched the sandwich to see if it was his. It was not. The food runner then took the plate away, and brought it to the correct table a few feet away. AFTER someone else had touched that food! 

As we hadn't seen our server, my husband got up to ask another employee if they could please check on the status of our table. Our food had never been put in! At this point we had been in this establishment for about 90 minutes. We were then assured that our food would be prioritized. Thirty minutes after THAT it still hadn't come out. Honestly, we ordered burgers! We are not the type to complain, but two hours after we sit down is truly unacceptable. My husband did speak with one of the managers, who did apologize and not charge us for the drinks our server had brought us. So that's something. We ended up leaving and having hot dogs from the concession stand at Talking Stick Arena. Let me tell ya, after that experience, those hot dogs were delicious!

The décor is well done and fun and it included a couple of fake trees as well as a multicolored ping pong table that is free to use.  

The procedure to order is a bit confusing if you have not been there before.  You wait in a line to order but it is not clear where the line starts.  There are several different menu items to review so the process was slow as there were a few people ahead of us that could not decide what to order.  We ended up getting the lobster Mac and Cheese as well as a Park salad.  The Lobster mac & Cheese was very bland and contained less than 4 pieces of small lobster bits.  Not what we were expecting for $16.  The Park Salad was good but was over dressed.  One issue is that we wanted to split the orders.  The food is served in large bowls and when we asked for side plates, we were told they did not have any.  They ended up giving us plastic trays with wax liners to use as plates.  

We also tried the beer wall.  This is a great concept but fails on execution.  You have to purchase a card for a set amount (I believe $10 is minimum) and then put the card on a reader and start to pour your beer.  The problem is foam.  Mostly foams comes out of the taps and you end up paying a lot of money for a glass of mostly foam (you can see the dollars roll off the card on the readout when you are pouring).  The benefit of the pour wall is that you can try a lot of different beers (mostly microbrews) without having to order a full beer.  Still, the cost is heavy and we ended up with extra dollars on the card we did not use.  You can use the card on a return visit but it is unlikely we will go back."	0.0

We ordered 2 IPA's, calamari and the spinach artichoke dip. The calamari portion was a joke and when we complained our server said she normally discourages those interested in ordering it. There were 6 small pieces for $11. Our bill including tip was $48.00, which is obsurd for what we ordered. We asked prior to ordering if they have a happy hour and one waitress didn't know and the other reluctantly told us they hadn't had it recently because of all the events going on.

The idea is great, but you really shouldn't make a place that has a food truck menu and looks like a sports bar seem like a fancy pants night club. After paying $25 for a tiny burrito and a beer, we literally had nowhere to sit other than a tiny countertop surrounded by people in line and phone chargers. 

I saw a number of empty tables but all of them were blocked off and ""reserved"". I was told they were VIP when I asked if we could sit somewhere to eat our food. The server was nice and confirmed with his manager that my group could sit there since they didn't have anyone coming in. Once we sat down a girl came up and told us that the tables were reserved and we couldn't sit there. She grabbed her manager Joe, who acted like we were lying when we told him we were told by staff that we could sit there. 

My burrito was mas-o-menos and the tortilla smelled like play-dough. Ceviche tasted fishy as funk. My beer even had a huge chip in the glass. 

The reviews say enough and are 100% valid. Take my advice when I say you aren't missing anything by skipping over this place. I'd say go to Arrogant Butcher if you're wanting to spend that kind of money. At least your food will be fantastic, the service will be fabulous and you'll feel like a valued customer. 

I almost would have rather gone next door to Fired Pie. At least I'd be able to sit at an actual table and the food would be worth the price.

The hostess was confuse, our waitress ditch us (and started helping other people while we waiting almost 20 minutes for her to come back, but she never did), the people working the food didn't know their own menu, which lead us to pay full price for drinks during happy hours, and the food was too expensive for the cheap/poor quality that it was worth.

Negatives:
-Can't order food and drink together. Had to wait in a line for food, then wait in another line for alcohol. 
-The self serve beer wall wasn't working
-Our server/cocktail waitress took over 15 minutes to check on our table to let us know she was covering our section
-NO SALT AND PEPPER SHAKERS. What an odd issue to be faced with. Our chicken tenders were bland and we asked our server for salt & pepper to which she responded ""we actually don't have that.""  
-For a place called The Park, I wanted more of the outdoors in. Other than the trees and a couple gas lamps the esthetic still just felt like a big sports bar. I think more natural light would have helped, maybe some park benches? Still fun look though. 

Positives:
-Whatever food truck had the tacos were great! Ordered a second round
-When the 2nd round of food came the head chef delivered it and asked for thoughts and opinions. Any establishment that takes constructive criticism I can appreciate. We told him about the salt issue, to which he said there was some at the napkin station. Once he left we checked, but still found no salt & pepper though. 
-Food truck concept is cool and gives me a chance to try multiple in one location
-Has potential. Just need to work out the kinks. 


Suggestions:
-Make sure staff is comfortable with proactively checking on patrons, not just waiting to be flagged down. 
-Get salt & pepper shakers... like a lot, not just one set."	2.0

The beer selection is pedestrian, the staff was unorganized and confused. It feels like an advanced version of TGI Fridays. The background music was even lame.

We were a little confused how it works since we never actually had a server come up to us besides a runner dropping off the food 20 minutes later. I had the 3 tacos which were so small I wouldn't pay on $1 each but they were $10 with the chips.  A bonus is that if you order a non alcohol drink, they had you a cup so you can go up and get refills as you please. I believe the cup is a little over $3. Another positive is that my wife ordered brisket that came with 2 large slices of bread and a side spicy mac and cheese. i was a little jealous since her meal was only a little more than mine but the portion size was more than double.	2.0

-The menu boards kept slowly fading on and off, so they would randomly disappear for 15 seconds while trying to figure out what we wanted

-Two of our three entrees were not even close to what we ordered. One was specifically ordered ""no meat"" (which the cashier did confirm); basically recieved a beef burrito. The other was an order of 3 carne asada tacos; got one carne asada, one pork, and one shrimp. We had to go up to the counter to find someone to correct our order (which it eventually was), but it took several minutes for the cashier to hunt down someone to fix our order

-DO NOT GET THE SELF SERVE BEER! They charge by the ounce and you get charged whether you get beer or foam, so forget about topping off to get rid of any foam. Don't know if it matters too much because about 1/3rd of the taps were out of service. They do also have a regular bar, so just get your drinks there.

-Also related to the self serve beer, I bought a $20 card which turned out to be loaded with $19 and some change, so I had to hunt down someone to fix this. Turns out that if you try to buy more than two drinks you'll have to go see an employee to get your card unlocked (I was using one card to buy for multiple people)

-The tortilla chips are fresh. I know because they were still soaking wet in oil when they arrived with the entrees

-The tacos are microscopic. Four inch tortillas with two chunks of meat each (one if you get pork) for $3 each

-The wait staff is all obviously experienced in working in restaurants, but after our food was delivered they were nowhere to be found. This made getting our orders fixed and getting the issues with beer fixed difficult"	5.0

I would consider myself somewhat of a chicken tender connoisseur and the tenders at The Park was terrible. Overcooked, tough, flavorless. The beer battered fries had good taste however most were undercooked. I was pretty disappointed with the good. I also had a pretty lack luster experience with paying and their self serve beer taps. I opened a tab and because of that they keep your card and give you a 'Park' card. They couldn't figure out how to change my food to their own card and had to do a separate transaction with my visa.

The food was way overpriced for the quality and size. The tacos are barely big enough to feed a small child. I literally witness a tiny 5 year old look pissed off because he couldn't bite the taco he was given. It was a epic battle of child versus taco, the taco won the battle. When I got mine I had no success against the taco as well. The tortilla was like someone started to heat it up, then changed their mind. Tossed it to the side, Dusted it off then placed a pinch of questionable meat on it. The texture was like a hybrid of rubber and stale tortilla.  The wings and poutine fries were no better. They were extremely salty. It's like they had salt that was about to expire and the head chef told everyone to toss it all in the food.  The head chef made it a point to express that all his ingredients and recipes are from famous cooks.  That may be true. But one time I bought a cook book by Gordon Ramsay. Even though I stuck to the book and ingredients, my wife banned me to cook anything but eggs.  Honestly if you're there for the food. Save your money.

I came here for the first time tonight and the sign in front stated that we should seat ourselves, which is totally fine. We took our seats around 10pm. While we were waiting to be served, there were roughly 5 to 6 employees walking by and no one bothered to stop and ask if we needed anything; we were sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant, with no drinks or menus in front of us. It should have been obvious we hadn't been helped yet. We flagged down the manager, who smiled and told us she would find a server for us. She sent a young man over who said that the waitress assigned to our section was busy but he was going to find someone to help us. He finally comes back with a waitress who opened up with a passive-aggressive comment about how she wasn't supposed to be our waitress but because her co-worker was inefficient she was going to take care of us. (She even pointed out the lady who was supposed to be our waitress, who happened to be standing in the bar talking to the bartender). She explained the self serve beer system and said she would come back with waters and take our orders. 15 minutes later she finally comes back, but refuses to take our orders because she's supposed to end her shift. She turns around and leaves before we can even respond. There's another waitress who stops on her way to bus a table and says she'll be right back to take our orders. But she never came back.

Oddly enough, when I asked how much money they suggested for 2-3 beers and I planned on staying for an hour, they told me $20-$25! No mention of a ""responsibility limit"". That is a crucial part of the self serve beer that they need to mention, especially if they don't plan to refund customers once they've hit their ""limit"". They need to train staff and execute their concept much better. No one showed us how to use the self-serve station and trying to locate an employee to help was an impossible task.

I can see paying maybe even $18.00 for a pitcher of craft beer, but come on!! This would make each individual beer $7.50. I'm sure our beer tab would have been much less with self serve or ordering pints. We split the Walk in the Park Sampler. Definitely not worth $17.00. The wings were bland, the chips has queso already on them so they were cold when we got them, the pretzel bites and mozzarella sticks were decent, but nothing to write home about, and they forgot to bring out the ranch, salsa, and queso dips. I was so excited to try this place, but I don't think I will go back, nor will I recommended to anyone.	0.0

Then we sit and come to find out it's counter service and we order up front. All the while the manager of this establishment was watching us walk around confused.

We went there before the Eric Church show to get a couple drinks and some food for an event that they had been promoting with a radio station.  We finally sat down at our table, and didn't see a server for well over 30 minutes.  Finally the server came, we ordered a round of drinks and some food.  Drinks came another 30 mins along with a heads up that 2 of the 4 items we ordered for food (which were on the menu) they did not have.  We ordered a couple burgers, and moved on.  The two items that were ordered (the Poki bowl) came out a few minutes later, and the fish was rubbery and salty and didn't seem safe to eat.  We finally found the server again and asked for one more round of drinks and to close out so we could quickly eat and leave to the show before we were going to be late.  Another 30 minutes went by and still no food, drinks, or bill.  We talked to 3 different people and were trying to locate our bill, so we could pay and leave, and actually go somewhere else to get some food quickly before the show.  No one could help us locate our bill, so we left.  Never in my life have I tried to hard to pay, and received no help from the restaurant.

First, it's super confusing...do you seat yourself, where do you get drinks, order food, do you have a server??? Decided to sit at the bar to make it easier. Waited for the bartender to stop talking to another coworker and tried multiple times to make eye contact to order a drink. Finally after a good 15 minutes another bartender helped us. Waited another 20 minutes to order food and finally left empty handed. Can't comment on the food because we never had the opportunity to try anything.

*Confession - The liquor was good (I ordered a Gibson which is pretty much chilled gin w/cocktail onions) but the customer service sucked big eggs!!! Grrr!*

I spoke with the bartender when I first touched down to find out where I could get some hot water and he referred me to a bakery that either wasn't in the immediate area or didn't exist. I ended up going to Starbucks to get what I needed & when I returned, I stood @ the bar for @ least 2 minutes until I flagged down a male server to ask if I needed to order from him. He asked if I was placing a to-go order, I told him I wanted to grab a quick drink, & he advised me to sit @ a table & order from female waitress.

The waitress (Lori) wasn't friendly @ all. I said hello when she first passed by but she either didn't hear me or flat out ignored me. I grabbed a seat next to a couple that was paying for their meal & on their way out. Not long after I sat down, a gentleman sat at the table next to me and I'm surprised she came to my table to take my order first (before his).

When I ordered, of course she asked for ID (I'm used to getting carded), but she also took it upon herself to inform me that my drink was considered a double (as if I couldn't afford a $12 cocktail). Needless to say, I finished my drink, and had to flag down another server in order to cash out my huge bill of $12.01. Luckily, I had gone to Starbucks earlier & had exact change. I'm usually a big tipper, but the only tip I needed to give her was to learn how to be more customer service oriented.

I called once again after receiving my horrible order and the manager didn't really care. After a couple minutes of me complaining she offered to stick a gift certificate in the mail to me.

This night of 1/2 was not really out of the ordinary.  Waitress seemed to favor bigger table and not overly friendly.  Happy hour ends at 6pm and we were there (2 of us) at 5:30 and the other 2 at 5:45pm.  Ordered food on split ticket at 5:50pm and got it at 6:40.  Had to flag waitress down to get another round of drinks, since she was preoccupied by bigger groups.  They charge for anything extra on the burger.  OK, bacon and cheese I understand - no problem.  They charge extra for mayonnaise of $.50.  I have been there 3 times in past month or so and EVERYtime the bill is wrong.  Sometimes in your favor, sometimes not.  This time I don't know.  The drink specials weren't posted, so I don't know what I really paid.  Food was undercharged.  Last time the drinks were overcharged.  3 of 4 ordered burgers medium.  All were well done !!  NOT pink at all, not even close.  Too bad.  The food is ok, but burgers are always well done.  Service is suspect at best and look at your bill.  We have always had a wrong amount.   Wait staff usually blame the owner.  Oh well.  We swore this is our last time there.  50 minutes to get a burger is ridiculous.  Maybe they need more staff?  It's a bar, we usually tip well if we are served quickly and correctly.  15% is my minimum and usually 20+%, even on alcohol.	1.0

I didn't get the bartender's name - she was thin and looked to be in late 40s or early 50s.  She wasn't real friendly but that wasn't a big deal.  I handed her a 20 and figured the pitcher of beer would be about $9-12.  This is a small bar in a strip mall in mesa, what most would consider a dive bar.  Anyway, she give me back $4.5 in change.  I tipped an additional $2 and did not get a thank you....so my pitcher of beer cost $15.5 in a dive bar in Mesa.  I finally went back up to the bar and asked if the price was correct.  She said that, yes, it is a premium pitcher and cost $15.50.  Needless to say, this is outrageous pricing and we will not be returning.	1.0

They are all over the place and because of their unorganization, they forget you've been standing there waiting to order a drink. 

The food is so-so, nothing special, though fairly priced. If you go solely for Karaoke on Saturday nights expect to sing 1-2 songs, 3 if you're lucky. The rotation is too long to work it's way back around. 

I ordered a beer on tap, the glass smelled of Clorox Bleach and tasted old. Made me feel sick to my stomach. They need to call 'Bar Rescue' or something.

When it comes to mixed drinks they are overpowering. For alcoholics this may not seem like an issue, but for those who are social, occasional drinkers who want a  nice, fruity tasteful drink..forget about it. They guesstimate the outpouring. The decor is ""weird"" to say the least. Old Westerny Theme could sum it up. It's DEFINITELY NOT for the Younger scene.

Appetizers are mostly overpriced for what is marginally a neighborhood dive. This isn't Tilted Kilt, but it is priced like it was. The food is usually good, as long as you steer clear of the cheese crisps - Taco Bell across the parking lot does better.

If you're into beer, this isn't the place to go - about the best beer they have in rack is Fat Tire. Mass-market domestic swill rules here. For liquor, Makers Mark is the best bourbon & forget about single malt Scotch whisky - they don't have any. In other words, you're not going to impress anyone with your taste in spirits coming here. This is the kind of place where they think Jack & Crown Royal are premium selections - and they charge premium prices for the privilege of drinking the stuff of alcoholics... I've begged them to bring in some Four Roses or Macallan - nope... mostly rotgut bottles. I guess if I wanted better booze, I could go to a classier place like Buffalo Wild Wings or Native New Yorker (this place is that far down the list.) I think the Hambone might have a better selection of things to imbibe in and that is sad. A far better experience for karaoke fans or hungry folk would be Old Chicago (Alma School & US60) on Sunday evenings with their $2.50 pints of anything in the rack.

Depending on who is behind the bar, you might have to wait an hour for your tab because the servers aren't supposed to be back there tallying up checks and the bartender might have her sights set on some old fart at the bar. Begging to pay your tab isn't fun, if you know what I mean.

By the way - if you pay with plastic, this place charges a surcharge - something that if people complain about will cost them their ability to take plastic - surcharges & service charges are an express no-no with Visa, MasterCard & Amex credit cards. Complain to your card issuer.

Sometimes I wonder why I go back - but the karaoke is fun (Maestro is the only staff member who usually sings - he is a crowd favorite & you'll love him) and some of the people in there are great - customers & staff. Again, not all the staff is competent and, typical of any karaoke bar, some of the singers think they will be discovered any day now. 

By the way - some of the five star reviews are from Simpleton's staff - they think the place rocks, or something like that.

When I called back to question of the ingredients in the salad. I was told the salad changed. they took away items and charged me more.

First of all, we waited over an hour and a half for our pizza and street fries to get delivered.  When the delivery guy gets to our door I asked him how much he said 23 and some change and I handed him 25$ and proceeds to walk away and not offer change.  Already assuming that he would keep the rest.  When I bring the food in and open it the fries were soggy and lukewarm like it had been sitting out.  The pizza looked the same, it was almost cold and the cheese was coagulated.  My boyfriend and I just found it unappetizing and we decide to call back and complain.  To which Brandy replies that they were really busy but they were going to make the food over and send it out.  We then decide that we don't want the pizza anymore because we waited so long already for them to have delivered us old food.  So I call back and advise brandy that we changed our minds and we would come into the store and return the food and that we were going to get something else for dinner.  Basically just to show them why we were so unhappy and also get a refund.  I walk into the store and woman is on the phone and doesn't acknowledge me.  When she hangs up the phone  I smile and greet here.  She still doesn't acknowledge me and just shuffles papers and stapler around and then finally says Oh you are Ria?  I said yes I bought the food here just want to show you the food and also get my refund.  She says I have to ask Scott to approve the refund and heads to the back and I can see her talking to the older man in the back and he is obviously complaining anf talking to her about the whole situation right in front of me.  After I wait there for about what feels like 10 min he finally comes to the front saying ""you shouldn't have come we already had the food done and we were going to bring it out.""  ""Next time don't come here.""  ""Also we don't do cash refunds, but tonight I will make an exception.""  
To which I reply to this ""well there wont be a next time.""  
And he says ""See what happens when you try to do someone a favor.""
He hands me my money and says under his breath ""Enjoy your burgers.""
I proceed to ask him ""what is your problem, you think that you can just say whatever you want to your customers?""
He says ""Aren't you getting burgers?""  Acting completely ignorant and Brandy chimes in ""Well aren't you getting burgers you said you were getting burgers on the phone.""
I said no I did not I said we are going to get something else.
Scott says ""Well I'm not gonna stand here and argue with you.""  Mumbles things under his breath as im walking out.
I tell my boyfriend what happened and goes into the store.
Scott tells him that I am no longer allowed in the store because I was droping f bombs.
My bf just shook his head and walked out.
I call another location to get information about how to take this to upper management only to find that Scott is the general manager of the store.
This man and even his staff specifically Brandy are absolutely horrid.  He even admitted to messing up the first time on the food.  THey knew the food was old and still sent it out to us and acted as if he was doing me a favor by returning my money, which by the way did not include the tip.  I would never recommend anyone to go to Streets.  He sets a bad image for the whole company.  If you care about your customers I would recommend you find a new manager who cares about customer service."	0.0

When she finally approached me she asks what is going on? I told her that I would like my food. She said that it is taking some time. When I asked for my money back she agreed and went in the back. She then comes back and tells me that she couldn't give me my money back because I paid online. I explained that I had three hungry kids at home and I need to go somewhere else. She gave me attitude.

Normally we go the 59th and Thunderbird location, but our server Kristin wasn't there so we left. (A tip to anyone going there, turn around and leave if Kristin is not working. We've had gone there a couple times and the service was horrendous.) Anyway, the service lacked in every way. We waited forever for our food and when it arrived, it was sadly not worth the wait. I know that part the server could not control, but she could've had a better attitude about it. When we asked another server for a refill, we couldn't have been more uncomfortable due to the whole attitude issue. I'm sorry Streets Of New York, but I can't seem to be willing to understand the wait time if the server is treating us like a nuisance. I guess it takes a special kind of server to keep the good paying customers around... What a shame.	1.0

The Owner/Manager at this location is the poorest excuse of a manager at a customer-oriented business. He is a JERK. 

I used to order delivery from this location all the time.

One night, about 25 min. before the location closed, I called and asked if it were too late to order for delivery. The woman said No, that placing an order was completely fine. So I ordered online for delivery and put it on my debit card. They charged my card nearly $70, however no one showed up after 60 minutes, I waited another 20 minutes before calling the location only to get constant ringing, they were obviously closed at that time and no one called me or emailed about my order.

The next day, I waited for them to open and called. The manager got on the phone and I explained what had happened and told him I wanted a refund because we never got the delivery, to which he rudely replied - we were there, you didn't answer. And he said ""you're not getting a refund"", laughed, and hung up on me!

First, saying that they came? Complete lie. Not only do I have a dog (chihuahua) that barks like crazy at the slightest knock or noise by the front door, but also, our front door was open with the screen door closed. We not only would have heard the person, but we would have seem them and my dog would have been barking like the world was ending. 

Second, HE HUNG UP ON ME! Total pet peeve of mine. My teenage daughter doesn't even hang up on me and this ""grown"" man who is supposed to work in customer service does?!

I tried calling back and was hung up on for a second time!

I wasn't getting anywhere with him, so I went online and sent a message to corporate. Within 2 hours, a lady from the corporate office contacted me, apologized, and told me that they spoke with the location and informed them to process the refund, and that all I needed to do was follow up with the location. The woman at the corporate office was so polite and friendly :)

I didnt want to follow up with the manager who had been so rude and hung up on me, so I decided that I would go to the location and hopefully be able to deal with another employee.

So myself, my 16 year old daughter, and her 17 year-old friend (I wanted a couple witnesses) drove to the location. 

We went inside and I explained my situation to the lady at the counter, she was rude as well, but not nearly as bad as the male manager. She said that only the manager,  the one with whom I DID NOT want to deal with, could help me.  

The manager was outside, so the lady called him in. As soon as he flung open the front doors, he started literally yelling at me in front of the other restaurant guests and employees! He swore at me and berated me and barely let me get in a word. He was furious that I contacted corporate. I kept my cool, again asked for my refund and he was so mean and began processing my refund in such an angry manner that he nearly broke my debit card.

I will never order from this location again, that man should not be able to manage a cage of lab rats let alone a restaurant. He was an angry man with the charisma of a brick. 

I encourage everyone to steer clear of this location. I would hate for anyone else to go through the humiliation of being yelled at and belittled in front of complete strangers."	4.0

I tried to call to get a credit, and after a few days got a text that an amount not matching mine had been credited to a card ending with 4 digits not matching mine.  This was a month and a half ago.

I am the kind of person who is willing to pay more for good quality and I don't mind a wait either. In fact I am an ideal customer, who rarely complains. Tonight was terrible!! I ordered my dinner through the website a little early, because I know it usually takes an hour or so for the food to arrive, though I am only 2 blocks away. My order was supposed to arrive at 6:30. At 7:15 I decided to give them a call to make sure there were no issues. The girl who answered the phone assured me that my order had just left. So we waited. At 8:10 I had my significant other call, and he was informed not only did they have no order for me, but that in fact their computer had just happened to break today. So the 60.00 I was charged through their personal website was not even on record. On asking to speak with a manager we were informed that only she and a cook were there, no manager on site. So there was no way to get my money back until I spoke with this higher up? Don't get me wrong I have a decent amount of money in my account, but 60.00 is nothing to scoff at. It's too late now to order pizza anywhere else, since we waited all night for this order that didn't go through. I am not even upset really about the order messing up, I mean things happen. I am super mad about the fact that I was blatantly lied to, when I could have made different accommodations for my evening other than waiting for food that never came..

When the smug girl on the phone took my order she failed to take my address for delivery. Assuming that they had it on file, I didnt even ask.

Failure one was not checking the address or even bothering to take one.

Even if I wasn't lied to about them trying to call, its hard for me to believe that the caller ID couldn't have been matched to the order time to get a correct number.

The first problem was a bit of racism towards people of color. My wife and i have been in for a pick up order a couple of different times. My wife brings my bank card in and she has no problems paying for the order with my card, and vice versa. However, we sent my cousin in (with my card) who also happens to have a skin tone and a look that resembles a mexican american, to pick up my order the employee required identification to match the name on the card. My cousin returned to my house and i went back to pick up my order... the same employee took my card and ran payment without requiring identification. Yes, my wife and i are white... and have yet to be carded for any purchases in this location, including alcohol purchases.

The second problem. Placed an order for pick up. Ordered thin crust. Got home to find the pizza was cut into triangles. YOU DONT CUT THIN CRUST INTO TRIANGLES, you cut it into squares. The pizza will limp over like a wet noodle if cut into triangles. Also, it was almost fully dry, like no sauce at all.

The third problem. Placed an order for delivery at 7:30pm. At 9pm, no pizza. i call in to ask where my pizza is at and the staff dont have any info on me and cant find my order. While im on hold, i check my bank account and i was already charged the $40 for my order. They finally find my order and said the pizza went out on delivery 20 minutes ago. I wait until 9:30pm until my pizza finally arrives. I inspect the pizza first, its cold and looks like it has been sitting on a counter for over an hour. I refuse the pizza from the driver and call in to get a refund. Employee on the phone was less than apologetic.

The experience hubby and I just had was one of the most ridiculous ones we have had in awhile. So hubby got there first and placed order for us at 6pm (we were in time crunch so made note of the time to be sure we had enough time to order a pizza). I arrived at 6:15 & he had still not received the drink he ordered and said that the servers and manager (which turned out to be the owner and makes this experience even worse!), had walked past his table many times and never brought his drink or offered bread like they did to all other tables. When I sat down at the table, no one ever came up or asked to get me a drink etc. This place has about 7 tables with our table being next to cash register so clearly we weren't unnoticed. I asked the owner if he could get his drink and expressed that it had been 17 minutes. The owner doesn't offer to get the drink or apologize, but makes an irritating situation worse by saying sarcasticly ""oh it wasn't 16 or 18 minutes?!"" & begins to laugh at me. I could not believe it. I asked if he was the manager which is when he arrogantly said he was the owner and I said well, that's worse. I am a business owner and first of all would never speak to a customer in a condesending or sarcastic way and certainly not because a patient customer politely asked for the drink they ordered almost 20 min prior. He literally walked away rolling his eyes and laughing at me when I was speaking to him. I hope that this review saves other pizza lovers from a dinner that is ruined by poor service and an owner who treats his customers so poorly. It literally ruined my night. I don't know what the reason was why my husband was totally dismissed or treated different from the other customers. Nor do I know why the staff also did not want to greet me or get me a drink, but at the end of the day, those things were just small annoyances we would have totally let slide if it weren't for the owner's comments and actions which are completely inexcusable.

Horrible service they call themselves a d express as an excuse not to offer the same services and quality. They are bigger than any rockets I've been to at a mall how can they call themselves an Express. They have no bottomless fries no counter service and no 50s style them dressed staff just jeans and a t-shirt. This is not a Johnny Rockets.

To top it all off they screwed up my order which I verified was correct on my receipt which means they don't bother to read the orders and just make them the default way like robots.

The burger patty was extremely thin... each bite was all bun. My husband's bun appeared to be stale. You'd be better of going to in n out nearby if in the mood for a burger. A burger should leave you full when you're done... We left feeling like we could eat more. 

I also find it necessary to note that when we left, there were no employees in sight, no cashiers, cooks, no one. They must have all been in the back.

Also, ordered 1 Chocolate Shake $3.99, it was okay. It tasted like drinking Hershey chocolate syrup out of the bottle and then (drum roll) one amazing Strawberry Shake $3.99.

My mother recently purchased two cakes from Fry's: a black forest cake and a Napoleon cake in honor of my birthday.  During the birthday song, I plucked off some blackberries from one of the cakes (hush, it was my birthday!). When the lights came on, I was a bit horrified to see that the remaining berries were covered in white fuzz.  I am very very certain that this fuzz was not sugar, but MOLD.

If you are going to sell a cake topped with fruit, it is very important to use FRESH fruit, or just abandon the concept and put chocolate on the cake instead. I mean, it is a cake, not a tart, and everyone likes chocolate. Or, how about a fruit-shaped cookie or fondant molded into the shape of a strawberry?   

Needless to say, I survived eating the moldy berries, and apparently the taste was well-masked by super sweet frosting. But Fry's Bakery, please take note of this because putting moldy fruit on your otherwise pretty cake is sinful, disgusting, sad and offensive."	9.0

On my way to customer service, I stop at the dairy case for an 88¢ carton of milk, believing that Customer Service will see the logic of placing said carton at the Deli counter.

Why is there no cream; why can't the clerk make refunds? I wonder aloud.  ""There's a problem with the warehouse; ever since Kroeger took charge,"" seemed to be the mumbled response.

They were correct. I never could get a teller to address the issue. When I finally re-gathered my items and went to a regular checkout lane, 3 of the self-check lanes were locked up.

Let me paint you a picture of what I seen and heard. I went there and was behind an elderly gentleman carrying his little bag with his lunch he was limping and had on a Frys apron. He went to the front manager and asked him if there was a department he could work that day because he was just not feeling to good. It appeared he was just asking for that day. The front end manger replied, ""I am not sure I don't know if you know how to do anything else. I just need you to pick up the speed where you are know before I consider anything else. I know I was nosing in his business but it was very heart breaking and degrading at the same time. Let me tell you something Mr, Front end Manager this elderly man is probably the last few of his kind that knows how to work and I am sure worked his tail off. Do NOT ever talk to that generation with anything but respect and kind  assistance where you can offer it. That is if he even allows you because that generation never looked for handout and that is why this gentleman is still working and packing his little lunch to show up for work and not call in like many would or I am just assuming with your company maybe that will be your excuse to let him go. So after listening to this and no it was not my business but I am sure half the things anyone witness in public is not anyone's business but we still slow down to see the wreck. So I proceeded to get my $325.00 of groceries at your place when I should have walked right out and drove down the road. I went isle to isle and as I neared the front another female front end was barking out orders to the checkers yelling right in my ear. Yes, I looked at her and gave her one of my signature looks (Are you serious what is wrong with you) type of look and she continued to degrade the front end employees. However it must not have had an effect on these two clowns that checked me out. Because they were laughing at other people with disabilities and bagging my groceries like they were tossing rocks in a pile. Now let me gentle remind you FRYS without your customers you are nobody and word of mouth travels so fast and as you know all the advertising on billboards cannot compare for a bad experience and a woman that will make it her job to inform the abuse this elderly man took on this day. I was never going to step foot in this store but that is wrong to complain -and not do something. So every week about 2 times I make it a point to check to see if this gentleman still works there and that he may be treated a little more kinder. SHAME ON YOU! for allowing these putz kids to act like idiots and the little feeble elderly man that apparently needs the job and comes to work to make the best out of it is treated with such degrading words and gestures. I wanted to reach in my purse and give him his wage for the day and whip on his apron and show your little store what compassion really means. But I figure this is a generation with great pride and it would do nothing more than make him feel worse. Mark my words! If I ever have your front end manager yell in my ear as I pass by or witness your employees show this man any disrespect you will hear my opinion yell right back and you know those people who holds signs and marches in front of your store well there is a truck full of worker down by Home depot that I can get together that you will see my opinion loud and clear."	3.0

I thought they would have more desserts. The kids didn't like the ice cream but the loved the chocolate fountain. I also went to the fruit and salad section and was bummed there wasn't more fruit. Only sliced oranges and melon was available. Skip the sesame chicken. It was waaaaaay salty.	0.0

This one however is the exact opposite of what the one in Surprise was. It started right away. We ordered drinks and a chocolate milk for my 2yr old and were told you'll get it at your table. Then we were told they didn't sell chocolate milk. Then they argued about it and we're rude to my wife about it. The majority of the food appeared to be inedible. Now I'll say they got one star cuz the steak was good and so was pot roast and the banana pudding was excellent. Our waitress was very kind and courteous and kept our drinks filled and table cleared even though being very pregnant. Now let me tell you about the filth!!! They're lucky and so are you I can't post pictures because they are appalling. From the food stations, the wall surrounding our table and OMFG they restroom.

I was expecting a large population of Hispanics, considering the area, but I was not expecting the mass of people coming to eat here Sunday afternoon in their church attire. The place was packed. There weren't even that many people at Dysart Golden Corral on Thanksgiving Day! I immediately felt my anxiety rise.
Once seated, my friend and I had to take a moment to mentally prepare before attempting to navigate the buffet... It was so crowded. I got meatloaf, mashed potatoes, steak fries, pot roast, and a yeast roll. The meatloaf is one of my new favorite things at GC, but I noticed it looked different. It had a gravy on top instead of the ketchup I'm used to. And when I tried it, it was cold and gross. Definitely a different recipe. I couldn't eat it. And I did not get the mac & cheese I usually love because it looked like it was still frozen... my friend said it was cold. What a disappointment!
The dessert bar was a nightmare to navigate. I couldn't get anywhere near the chocolate fountain. People just crowd around there and cut in line. It's awful. The dessert bar was also slim pickins... there wasn't as much selection as there normally is and what they did have was running low. The workers couldn't seem to restock quickly enough. Speaking of workers, they kept blocking the aisles and we couldn't get to & from our table easily. This location sucks and I don't ever need to come here again."	3.0

ZERO STARS HERE... Never again will we eat there.  The place was filthy. Food all over the carpet, sticky tables, stuck-on food all around the steam table trays,empty salt and pepper shakers,  and extremely rude employees. We stopped in around 7pm, so there was still plenty of time before they closed. The steam trays were almost empty - all of them -- and what was still there was over-cooked, dried-out, stuck-on globs of yuck.  Nobody seemed concerned about re-stocking (I guess because there was still a tablespoon or two of food permanently crusted onto the trays, so technically they were not yet empty). What little we managed to salvage to put on our plate was disgusting. How can anyone ruin canned corn?!?  

To make matters worse, we had to look hard to find a clean plate - through several of them before we were successful.  The silverware was the same.  We pulled several of each utensil before finding one without food stuck to it. When we showed this to the server, she just shrugged her shoulders and walked away. She didn't even take the dirty plates/silver with her.  

The table next to us had several people of various ages...one in a high-chair, twin toddlers in diapers,one young child, mom, and grandma.  There was food all over the place.  (Parents, if you take your children out to eat, PLEASE teach them some manners.  It is NOT appropriate to continually throw food on the floor, and it is DEFINITELY not cool to drop cotton candy on the floor, then pick it up and continue to eat it!!).  Anyway....after they left, the mess was huge.  The server removed the dishes, etc, then swept the chunks of food ONTO THE CARPET instead of onto one of the dirty dishes. After taking the dishes to the back, she returned, wiped off the chairs, and then WITH THE SAME CLOTH, wiped off the table.  EXCUSE ME.  You just had 2 toddlers in diapers (and no other bottoms)(and I can attest to the fact that at least one had a lumpy, dirty diaper!), sitting on that chair.  You wiped it with a dish cloth, and then used that same dish cloth to wipe off the surface of the table, where we put our silverware and food?!?  Are you insane?!?  If you don't have the sense to use two different cloths, at lease please wipe off the table with a clean cloth first, THEN the seats...and then GET A NEW CLEAN CLOTH before you wipe down the next table.

She never did return to clean the food off the floor. When we left we had to be careful not to step into any of it or we probably would have slipped and ended up sitting on the floor!

My recommendation - avoid this location unless you are starving and nothing else is open.  We still prefer the Surprise, AZ location, or the Northern Ave,PHX location. Both of them are clean, well stocked, and the people are extremely nice."	1.0

I was serving myself to some wings the manager grabs the tray from me so I had to wait on him for the ribs it was 10 past 4pm and he kept telling the cooks not put the ribs out until some of the lunch crowd left.

I thought I would try to go to the bathroom which was my biggest mistake. On the bathroom their is a digital screen that asks for a password that's on your receipt. It was locked for a couple minutes so I assumed someone was in there and it was a one person restroom, then out of nowhere a number pad popped up. I entered a 4 digit code and then...nothing. I tried it a couple times, some people behind me tried a couple of times (and then left because it wasn't worth it) and still nothing. Finally I was able to flag down a kid that worked there and he told me that they had printed the wrong passcode on the receipt because it was recently updated and unfortunately because I had tried so many times the door had ""locked"" itself and it would take a couple minutes to open. It wasn't the kids fault, bless his heart he looked like he wanted to die for telling me I couldn't get into the top secret wiz pallace. The best part is when I finally got in (thanks to the help of another employee) the bathroom was super disgusting and I'm not sure what they are gaurding so heavily.

The food is terrible; entrees are consistently made incorrectly, arrive at the wrong temperature, and are served in meager portions. (Chicken focaccia with a whole whopping tablespoon of diced chicken? Hell yeah!) Fries and rings are likely to be inedible by virtue of the line serving up whatever stale, rubbery and/or flaccid crap has been sitting around all day instead of dropping a fresh batch. 

The service is terrible; it's inattentive and extremely slow. 90 minutes. For lunch. With a handful of diners. Starting wistfully at your empty glass is a way of life here. 

The building itself is terrible; the design of this location is so acoustically bad that you literally cannot hear the person sitting next to you.

First of all let me preface by saying my fiance and I have been to many of the Zips around town and enjoyed the food and atmosphere but this new location in Chandler is a HORRIBLE!  We sat down at the bar on a Saturday evening for a few brews and munchies and to watch some games but we never got waited on!  The regular bar tender passed us by at least 3 times and the blonde behind the bar was doing dishes and just ignored us completely.  Some young guys walked up a few stools down and she practically ran to help them passing us by again.  We were blown away on how terrible the service is at the Chandler location. We walked out after 30 minutes having never been waited on.  We have a home in Chandler and we will NEVER be back to this god awful restaurant again!  Fire the entire staff!!"	6.0

Next I ordered dinner and 10 mins later the dinner comes out but no wings. I ordered the wings as an appetizer so assumed they would come out first like most appitizers do.  I asked the waitress where the wings were and she stated the kitched just started on them. I asked for the wings to be comped since the order was messed up. She went to the manager and he said no. I asked to speak to him and he stated he's not here to give away free food even though they made a mistake. I guess taking care of the customer is not the priority of this Zipps. I for one will not return to this Zipps or any others.  If he was concerned about the bottom line he should know that making the customer happy ahould be priorty. Then i would continue to come and tell others they should go also. So the $9.95 that this manager saved mostly cost this establishment a few thousands over the course of time. Great business decision.	0.0

I didn't get a good look inside, but it seemed really bright and did not have much ambiance. I know it's a sports grill, but still. The patio is nicer if the weather is decent.

We ordered three dozen wings (mild,mild golden and hot), chicken skewers, chips & salsa, and pizza.  It's a good thing we ordered the chips because it took them over 45 minutes to serve us the food. We looked around and noticed there were a lot of people also waiting to eat. 

The wings were decent and you can't beat the happy hour price of $6/dozen before 7pm. The wings are more crispy than juicy. We ordered the mild wings for the kids. They had a little kick to them, so next time I will just order them dry. The kids enjoyed the cheese pizza slices and the chicken skewers. The skewers comes with two sauces you can choose from and they had a light batter. They're bland without the dipping sauce (perfect for kids who love ranch or BBQ sauce). The chips were o.k.  Don't expect the thick corn tortilla chips you get at a Mexican restaurant. It comes with a side of spicy guacamole and salsa.

We normally love Zipps, but I think we will wait for them to work out their issue with the kitchen before going back any time soon. It's obvious by the crowd that this area wants them to succeed. The kitchen is not able to keep up with the demand in the front. It's a good thing our kids weren't starving because that would have made our experience worse."	3.0

Order was taking forever and when we asked our server Bridgett, she never apologized and made a smug comment about having lots of orders in front of ours. As I looked around the restaurant and asked where all the orders in front where going she snapped a quick response that there are lots of take out orders. Would you believe I never saw a single person walk out with one. 

To be fair it was her second week on the job, which brings me to our next opportunity. 

When food was finally ready Nick brought it out and as he was putting the food down on table he spilled a big full glass of water all over the table and over my wife. You would think he would have felt embarrassed and apologetic but instead he laughed the entire time while the rest of our party frantically cleaned it up before we all got wet. 

Oh one more thing, we get our check and they had the gull to charge us for 2 sides of ranch, 1 side of thousand island and jalapeños. 

By this time I was upset so I looked for the manager and to my surprise it was Nick the drink spiller. I brought up the whole terrible incident and said they could have at least comp the extra dressing or jalapeños and his response was classic ""ya I guess we could have"".

I prayed that my food didn't come out of the kitchen while the customer was setting her finger nail dust into the air! When my food did come out, the customer had already finished filing her nails but I was so grossed out, I couldn't eat my food. Why in the world would this be allowed in an eating establishment?!!

If I could give them no stars I would. I wouldn't go into too much about our server. She took 20 minutes to greet us for drinks. So we gave her our whole order at that time. Took 10 more minutes for drinks to hit the table. This was at 730. After we sat there for 30 minutes to get drinks. So we never saw her again. I got up went to the server station and refilled all 8 drinks at our table. Mind you there was a total of 12 tables in the whole place. This is where is gets good. At 825 after not seeing our server or the manager. We decided to leave. On the way out the host asked us if everything was okay. She was the only one int he building that even seemed to care. We told her and asked to speak to the manager. She goes and grabs a guy that was sitting at the bar eating and talking with the 4 bar guest. When he comes up we start telling him what was going on. He stops us and says what the F did I do to you. I said are you kidding me I have managed restaurants for 20 years and have never seen a manager act like this. I said you did nothing that is the point you have been sitting there eating since we walked in. He then told me to F off three times and stormed away. I asked if the GM was here to the host. See said that is Andrew our GM. I was taken back for a minute that he was the GM. So we wanted to pay our drink tab and the server was still no where to be found.  I see Andrew in the kitchen yelling and looking at us. So I walked his way he stormed out of the kitchen and said what the F do you want now. Another table said hey there is kids here. He told them to stay out of it. Then he said leave me the F alone I did nothing to you. I said your right just want to pay our drink tab. At this point you would think a GM would pay take care of the N/A drinks on the table. No instead he said here is your Fing tab. Then stormed away again. I have never and I mean never have seen a Manager let alone a GM act like this to guest. Like I said I run a restaurant and would never in my life act like this. Zipps your sales in this location can't be great. Live down the road from this location and normally swing in for a beer or two on my way home. I will never step foot in that Zipps or any other from this point moving forward. I will also being letting my staff of 150 know not to go there either. 
Andrew seems to be the real problem there. Feel free to contact me. I would love to talk to someone about this. The way Andrew acted is not okay for any body let alone a leader.He is not a leader more of a bully. Likely I am not afraid of bullies. Look forward to hearing from someone."	1.0

To begin with, our waitress delivered my beer and said that it was the last Coors Light, when I asked her if I could get a full beer she told me that the 32oz draft is sold in a 34oz mug so the solid 2.5 inches of space between the top of the beer and the glass was the 2oz difference.  I told her that was unacceptable and that I would rather have something else, instead of discussing the matter with me she simply walked away and ignored me as I tried to inform her of my new beer choice.  I grabbed a manager, she took away the beer but didn't seem to care that her server was just rude to me.  Seconds later a new waitress stopped by to introduce herself, and we were happy to have a new, polite, server.  As I was still upset about being disrespected I elected not to order anything and I kindly told the server that it wasn't her fault but that I wouldn't be eating despite the other 4 people in our group ordering dinner.

My wife ordered the chicken tenders.  She only had one bite before she told me to eat some because she didn't like them.  I took one bite and literally chewed through an entire tendon.  I spit out half the bite out, choked down the rest, and thought, well let's try another tender and see if it's any better.  I took a small bite and guess what, I felt as though I was chewing through a raw chicken tendon.  The single most disgusting thing that I have ever tasted.  We didn't complain because it just simply wasn't worth it.  We tipped our server 40% (3$ on a 7.50$ meal) because it wasn't her fault and left once everyone was ready.  

I will never patronize this Zipps location ever again.  If a friend wants to buy my beers I may return, but I will never spend another single dollar of my hard earned money to be disrespected.  Other Zipps locations may still get my business in the future, however, this location is by far the worst I have ever been to.

My husband and I come here often to hit up happy hour and the service in in the bar area is always great but the food is just missing that certain something. At first we thought we were finally just getting burnt out on Zipp's food - we spent the better half of our courtship eating and drinking at Zipp's Camelback and hit up the 16th St. location often while we lived in the north valley. But whenever we visit a location other than Ocotillo we are reminded of what the food should taste like - the wings taste are more succulent, the burgers are bigger and juicier and the fries are crispier. 

I am not sure what Ocotillo is doing wrong in the back of the house (old fryer oil? Incorrect wing sauce recipe? Too small of burger proportions?) but we will no longer visit this location and will drive a bit further to Gilbert / Warner to ensure we are tasting the Zipp's quality of food that we have grown to love over the past seven years."	2.0

Table top of 9 Sunday afternoon, this place was nearly empty. We were seated and our waiter took our drink orders and food orders. Orders were served but one order was missing.

In addition, I order Nachos, which was horrible. A large amount of chips with a handful of cheese on top. Ate 3 bites and the cheese was gone. What did I have left chips! lol The mozzarella sticks was nasty, greasy egg roll outside with a un-melted mozzarella stick. Was not at all appetizing. Both were terrible. 

Our concern was brought to the Manager's attention.....  Before, he obtain all information of the issue he argued and said we have ONLY been waiting 10 minutes. He spoke too soon to realize that we the missing order was just placed in the system 10 minutes ago but, actually was placed 30 minutes ago the first time. Therefore, everyone in our party was done eating by the time the missing order came out. At that point, the manager down graded his employee. He said, ""he is new and I am writing him up for this"" the manager continued to say ""he should have told me about the issue and he will be written up. He should have asked for help if he didnt know what he was doing and he didnt notify me that he needed help"" 

Like rather than an asshole he should have not shared that information but implemented improvements at training staff efficiently. The manager was just being jerk. We explained he didnt have to punish the kid but just see if there is overall operational improvements that can be ment.

Service slowed quite a bit but the food was good and our drinks were being served in a reasonable time. Came here today (12/10), sat at the bar, server greeted us quickly, got our drinks and when she brought them back we ordered. My husband got the fish and chips and i got the fish sandwich. Took a while for the food to come out and when it did, food was cold, fried were soggy and when I looked at the cup the tarter sauce was in i see buffalo sauce in it. Meaning one of the cooks stuck their finger in the cup before it was served. I didn't finish my food and am throughly disappointed. The server is nice and has been on top of my drinks otherwise we would have left immediately after.	0.0

I generally love Zipps.  Been to them ever since they opened the one on Camelback/Miller when I first moved here in 2001.  

I usually peruse the one on Gilbert/Warner, but wanted to give this one a shot.  It took forever to get a beer, and I was only checked on twice in an hour. 

Not saying I won't come back, because it seemed like it was a busy night and they were understaffed.  So, this easily can be remedied with an update.

We've been to their other locations and love their ice cold beer selection, their wings are the absolute best and always consistently prepared, and there are TV's everywhere when we want to watch games (especially ASU because we don't get the Pac 12 games at home w/our cable network). The prices too are super reasonable and the portions generous with one exception (see comments to follow).

Here's why the lower rating... First of all, the volume of the TV's are insanely loud!!!! At first we thought it was an accident or one employee cranking the volume, and now after a ton of visits, we know that's just how it's going to be. Even our teenagers, who've grown up eating at other Zipps, hate the volume so we would never choose to go there because the atmosphere is shot, volume dialed up even on nights when there is not a major game.

Secondly, the food, with the exception of the wings and salads, is just not that good. The focaccias have almost no meat in them and the fries are typically undercooked. The burgers are average, the bacon hard and over-cooked on numerous occasions. 

We eat out 5 plus times a week between lunch and dinner and I really hope this location improves because we'd love to go more."	1.0

Waitress acknowledged us right away, we placed our drink order (water and iced tea) which she brought promptly.  She was crazy busy taking care of what seemed like the entire dining room by herself.  We ordered two turkey burgers, one with a side salad one with onion rings, and then the 23 minute wait began for our food.  When the burgers arrived, it was the most sad looking display of food I have ever seen.  Turkey burgers were about 4 inches in diameter, 1/4 thick on a very bland white bun with a thin slice of pink tomato, old piece of lettuce and yellow ""red"" onion.  The onion rings were so disgusting, I couldn't even take bit.  The breading was a grayish brown, they were cold and just horrible looking. The turkey burger itself had a weird taste and we couldn't eat them.  The only thing that was pleasant about our experience was the waitress.

When going to Zipps, you can expect it to be LOUD, poor service (3 waitresses in one night, forgotten orders, waiting forever for service) and mediocre food. The beer selection is good but the prices are high, in my opinion ($4.75 for a draft of Blue Moon). We went to Zipps last night and I was very disappointed to see that they charged me $.50 for onions with my chili. I can understand charging extra for cheese, which is also $.50 but for a tablespoon onions? Come on! That is just being cheap and obnoxious. The chili tasted like it came out of a can. I wish I could have had a burger but recent dental work requires soft food and chili was the only thing on their menu that I could eat. I don't think we will ever go back, especially when the Ginger Monkey opens later this Fall. Zipps does nothing to make me want to go back. Nothing.	0.0

I should've known that when I walked in on a usually busy Monday Night Football night, that the place was nearly empty, I should've turned around and went home. Instead, I picked up an order and headed for home.

My order was pretty simple, chicken fingers, wings, and a cheeseburger for the little guy. The hamburger was raw. RAW! I'm not going to feed that to my child. My husband's O rings were nasty. The thin inedible part of the onion was battered and fried. Gross. Buffalo sauce tasted like they used Golden Wing sauce for the chicken fingers. 

The management is worse. Lavar, the manager, asked me to drive all the way from my home in Gilbert to the store so they could see the food and then maybe ""fix it."" No way. Why should I have to get back into my car and drive all the way back to your restaurant when you made the mistake? The answer was ""that's just company protocol."" Well, perhaps it's time to reconsider your ""protocols."" 

As a compromise they asked me to send them pictures via email to determine whether a refund was due. I sent the pictures and an email depicting the details of the order. I have been offered a partial refund with my order, which is mostly fair. 

But what about my evening that was ruined? Or the extra money I had to spend to go out to get fast food to feed my children because they couldn't eat what Zipp's prepared?

We started with chips, salsa, and guacamole. The salsa and guacamole were very bland, and the chips tasted stale. My wife ordered a chop salad with chicken. She said it was the worst salad she has ever ordered! (and she orders salad a lot!) The chicken was rubbery (like it had been cooked in the microwave) and had no flavor, just rubbery texture. About half of the lettuce was extremely soggy. (I'm guessing the salsa that came on the salad had been sitting for too long on the lettuce... yuck!) We also ordered a burger, a kids meal, and a cheese pizza (which our waitress forgot to put in the order.) We received the salad, the kids meal and my burger, and no pizza. Mistakes happen, but when they do I feel the waitstaff should do their best to compensate for their mistake. We were offered nothing. She did ask if we still wanted the pizza? Maybe she thought the two members of our party that ordered the pizza wanted to starve? I tried the pizza, I wish I wouldn't have. It tasted like a pizza you make from a kit in a box. The onion rings that came with my burger were awful! They were lukewarm, and the coating on the outside was chewy. (I have eaten quite a few onion rings in my lifetime, and I've never had an order with a chewy coating. Disgusting!) It's almost like the temp of the fryer was not hot enough, or they had been sitting for too long. My burger was fine. This experience goes down as the second worst meal I've ever had to pay for.	2.0

The fries were also only slightly warm.  We asked for fresh fries and onion rings from another server since ours didn't come back to check on us but, unfortunately, the ""fresh"" fries and onion rings were only slightly warmer than the original.  The burgers were good although very skimpy with the lettuce.  And one of the burgers we ordered said it came with cheese and 4 strips of bacon but only showed up with 2 strips of bacon and cheese.

We planned to watch the afternoon games today and arrived in the bar area just as the early games were ending and people occupying booths and tables were settling tabs. As luck would have it no one was leaving and seating in the bar area was scare. We elected to wait for a table to free up and ordered a few drinks from the bar. 

Luck would have it that a couple at a nearby table were leaving and knowing we were the only people in the bar area waiting, suggested we take their table. We took them up on their offer and quickly sat down. Within moments the waitress told us this table was reserved for her friends. Now as I have been told many times at his particular Zipp's, all seating in the bar is open and on a first come first served basis. Things quickly escalated with the waitress still maintaining she had promised the table despite the restaurants policy. Her friends had entered the restaurant after us and in all fairness were next in line after us for a table after we had taken ours. Things worked out in the end when a booth opened up in the same waitress's section and we quickly moved there. Service was fine, but I was still pissed that the waitress tried to skirt their policy for her friends, who in the end spent half of what we did on our tab.

Not sure this particular Zipp's wants to keep customers happy. On another occasion I came in for Monday night football only to find the place jammed. However 3 open seats we're at the bar and when I went to sit down, was told they we're reserved for guys outside smoking. Turns our the future lung cancer patients stayed outside the entire game tying up the seats and causing the bar to lose multiple customers who couldn't get a seat.

My husband raved about their beers and he said the food is ok so my daughter and I decided to give it a try.  I ordered fish and chips, my daughter ordered a burger and onion rings, my husband ordered sandwich and onion ring.  We waited long time to get our drinks and food.  When we got the food I was very disappointed.  My fish was so greasy that I had to blot out the oil on my napkin which soaked my napkin.  My fries greasy and when I picked it up it was limp and very salty.  My husband gave me his onion rings and it was same as my fries (greasy and salty).  It looks to me they just dropped the fries and onion rings for few seconds and took it out.  My daughter said her burger was worse than Mcdonalds burger.  I had to flag down our waitress as she never came by to see how our food was and told her the fries were uneatable and would like a sald instead.  I only asked for olive oil and lemon wedges and my daughter asked for ranch dressing for the burger.  The lettuce in salad was wilted.  I was only able to stomach couple bites.  When we finally got the bill she charged us for the Ranch dressing.  When I sent e-mail to Zipps the response I got was that they have the highest quality food and the prices area very reasonable.

I went there during lunch today (6/10/15) to celebrate a co-worker's 20 yr anniversary at our company.  She chose the restaurant. Since they don't have a food allergy menu like most mainstream restaurants do these days,  I bought food that I can eat from other restaurant. The manager comes out & tells me that I can't eat my food in their restaurant and that he's not making me throw it away,  but that I can't eat it in their restaurant. Really? Most restaurants I go to have menu options for people with food allergies. Others have always allowed me to being my own food.  First of all,  since they don't have a food allergy menu or options for people with food allergies,  Zipps is not a place I would ever go to for food. Second,  since the manager treated me in such a disrespectful way,  not even seeking to understand, I, my family,  and friends will NEVER set foot in any Zipps ever again.	0.0

It was very dark and loud inside so we decided to eat on the patio. They have ample amounts of TV's going with sports but they seemed a little loud and overbearing. The food is typical bar food but worse. We ordered the chicken rolls, chili, club focaccia and kids burger. The ideas are there but the execution isn't! In fact the menu descriptions make the food sound amazing and homemade. The chicken rolls were dripping in oil, the chili was greasy and I have no words for the sandwich. It was basically a thick piece of bread that did not resemble focaccia in any way, lacking in ingredients and tasteless. Onion rings and fries were typical, nothing special.

While changing my seat the employee who changed the tvs watched me from the bar area with a dirty look. Not sure what his issue was. The appetizers were okay. Ordered pizza by the slice (worst pizza) for my kids and a BLT which was not correct (added mayo when no mayo was requested). How do you get a BLT wrong? Well, they figured it out. A pile of burnt bacon and broken up slices of bread. After seeing it's quality, I decided to not have them make it right. Them getting the order wrong was a good thing since I did not have to pay for what looked like a bad BLT. I have been to another Zipps. The issue with this one is clearly management.

Our nachos came out with nothing on them and we asked for all the stuff it was supposed to have- they brought it all out in little cups but neglected to tell us that EVERY ITEM WE REQUESTED WAS AN ADDITIONAL $.50!! So our tiny plate of nachos that the menu said was $6.50 turned out to be $10!!! When I asked to see the menu the waitress neglected to show me one- since of course I knew what I was talking about and to top it off the manager never came over and was a coward- letting the waitress take the heat!

Finally got our appetizer - chicken with garlic and mushrooms.  Canned mushrooms.  Gross.  The chicken and sauce were good but seriously?  Canned mushrooms?  How much effort does it take to chop a few fresh mushrooms?

I had the gyro salad - it had iceberg lettuce, a couple tomato slices and a few cucumbers.  The gyro meat was good but, really?  iceberg lettuce?  Sigh....  It did come with tzatziki sauce but, I've had better.  This tasted like it came out of a bottle - definitely not freshly made.

I have lived here all my life and I haven't been because I don't spend much time in the area. But it was late, in the area and I was hungry, so we're my friends. 

First off, the service is super slow. Not only that, we had to ask serval times for stuff we wanted like a beer and ketchup. We spent over $70 for almost nothing. This place is way over priced for what it is.

I got the chicken shawarma pita. First off Haji Baba is 100,000 times better than this and cheaper and I would rather go to Halal Guys over this place. Not a lot of chicken and here were pickles inside this and not the middle eastern pickles some small sliced nonsense. The only thing I liked were the fries. Although I asked for extra crispy and they were just hot. :/ sigh. We also ordered the tzatziki sauce app and gyro app. It was standard and nothing to really write about.

The hookah was decent. They have one of the best flavored tobaccos used, but honestly they killed it with too many coals and it became harsh pretty quick. They also charge $6 a person extra of the 2 max to smoke hookah. I mean come on. $6 for another piece of plastic on top of what we are already paying for...I'm good.

This place is really on a downward trend when it comes to their quality and service, which is disappointing to see because I've been coming here for as long as I can remember.

We put in our order for just a hookah which came pretty quickly, but was not to my specifications. Then the two only two employees that seemed to be working that afternoon walked by us several times without so much as asking if we needed anything. Again, there was only one other gentleman there, so I don't believe there is a valid reason for the lack of service.

Ignore the good reviews, those were before the new cheapskate owner. Its obvious they are targeting tourists with high prices and low portion to get every penny out of them since they likely wont return anyway.

The new owner is obviously not just cheaping on the food, one poor girl worked the takeout section, the bar, and the restaurant. As far as I can tell she was the only one working on a Sunday at 1pm.

So first off we walk in at 815ish (closes at midnight) and there is nobody in the restaurant besides the 4 servers. We get our food, wasn't bad, but small portions just like the rest of the reviews say. 

So we finish eating and it comes time to get our check it's 8:52 (we started paying attention to the time because it seemed to be taking a while). At this time one other table gets seated and they just order a hookah.

It wasn't until 9:10 until someone came over and asked if we were ok to which we replied well we kinda need the check. (We have no idea who our server even is at this point). The girl who we asked the check from comes back at 9:26 and asked if everything was ok? We replied no we haven't gotten our check yet... She frantically says sorry I told them to get it and runs to the back. She comes back 10 minutes later with the check and then takes another 6 minutes to run it.

This is the first time in my life I've not left a tip.

Then to top it all off we leave furious as hell after signing the receipt to find our car is blocked in by a Lexus who is seriously just parked in the middle of the driveway blocking my car and one other. Mind you our car is parked right outside the front door where management should have told him not to park.

Dolmades or grape leaves dish was so-so. Finally, gyros isn't fresh off the spit as it should be for the best taste and quality. Based on taste and the identical cuts of each strip of gyros (only 4 measly slices for a $13 plate), I was able to tell the gyros was prepackaged and most likely frozen. Everything was edible at least, but far from what it could be and every item is overpriced due to the size and/or quality. I've got another Greek place in Phoenix area that serves much better Greek/Mediterranean food I'll go to instead.	1.0

The waitresses don't check on water or drinks or to see if you want more. The hookah service is a little better, but not by much. I like the food for the most part and there are decent amount of the vegetarian options, but overall this is my least favorite hookah bar.	0.0

She swept up while we waited for our order, but we still sat next to a table with a filthy tablecloth. Not appetizing. The food was okay, the waitress was cheerful and attentive, probably because she saw I was discombobulated by the atmosphere. I was trying to be a ""come with gal"" for my husband.

We called in our order and the gal on the phone seemed like it we were putting her out.  I guess the computer in the non restaurant section (where we'd be picking up our food) was down.  We weren't told how long it would be or how much our order was going to cost.  I ordered the gyro pita with the house salad. 

We head over, pay and get out order (the gal seemed irritated to have to walk over to the other side to run the card), and head back to work.  I dive into my lunch and something is off.  The salad was warm, like wilted warm.  Who wants to eat warm floppy lettuce?  Anyone...Anyone...Bueller?    

My gyro was drowning in tzatziki.  I ended up throwing most of my lunch away -  there was no salvaging any of it.  Not sure if there's new owners or management...but the quality and customer service has definitely gone downhill.

We walked into the bar/ lounge area looking for someone for direction but quickly noticed this was a bar scene and not a scene for a 16 year old. Finally we found the patio area and we sat down at a table. There was a couple sitting a few tables away from us but no one on the staff acknowledged our presence. As I was looking for someone to help clean our table, I noticed there were a couple of teenage kids in the back corner of what looked like a kitchen, sitting down and looking at us. They never summoned anyone to help us nor did they offer to lend a hand to service us. Our table had a lot of dried bird droppings so we almost left but decided to tough it out. We ordered dinner but were never asked if we wanted anything to drink. Weird? I had to flag down a waiter who was passing by for some drinks. Just about that time 5 men decided to sit down at the table next to us and each one ordered a hookah. That made the experience even more distasteful because of the myriad of hookah scent smells mixing in with our dinner. We decided to hurry and eat and get the hell out of there. Then To make matters worse the waiter was clearing out each of the hookah chambers by blowing which spread the residual ashes into the air and of course onto our table. Let's just say the whole place seems to cater to smoking and NOT to a fine dining experience. We will not be back but thought I'd share the experience especially if someone wanted to eat in the patio area outside.	0.0

I let him know I am at the hotel 5 minutes away and I would be right there. He acknowledged that and said great thank you. 

I was to the restaurant no more than 5 minutes later and I walked in and was greeted by two hostess' who were wonderful and called another manager who was completely confused about what was happening and asked for my ID. He disappeared for a few minutes and came back who said Permisis left for the evening and he called him and he would be back to the restaurant within 15 minutes. 15 minutes later.....

We had a large party so I am lenient about the slow service. The worst thing that will 100% keep me from returning was the water. It tasted like toilet water. That is no exaggeration. It was so gross. We asked about it and hat said that is just how it is. We are a water family. We don't go out and buy drinks. If I can't have water with my meal, I won't be back.

My daughter's food finally came out and it looked like it had sat awhile so it was all dried out. No problem, I'd like to get more sauce but she never returned.  Even though I pointed to my salad and said my app isn't up but there's my salad, server looked and walked away.  Finally I asked for the check and she even messed that up.  I told her she needed to work on her service and she could care less stating she knew.  Sadly although I know the manager came by a couple times and could see we were waiting but never offered to fix it.  I told her at the end the waitress wasn't ready for the floor and the manager just looked again like she knew!  I mean come on!  Tonight was a prime example of why even the best food can be ruined by lousy sloppy service.

Keep in mind it was only like four or five in the afternoon. When we sat down the place was coming off cheap. Paper on the tables poor lighting. Not to mention we waited ten minutes just to get water! We ordered apps and y hose came out before the bread. The apps were zucchini and we're so thin and burnt was not worth the 9 dollars. And the mac and cheese that were okay but nothing special. We were never waited on by a waiter but the fricking bartender. It's wrong to have six customers two being children at the bar.

As he catered to the large table that wasn't even completely seated when we arrived we were never asked how her food was we were never given an update he poured their oil offered them cheese offer them refills and we got nothing. The kicker is when he told me after I asked for the bill twice and waited 15 minutes for it to arrive that the manager would remove an item when he returned the bill with my card and it was not off I asked him about it again and he said yeah she changed her mind she doesn't want to do it.

I have loved this restaurant chain for many years, first in Northern California and then when we moved to North Phoenix.  I've eaten at this location many times in the past always with excellent meals and service.  However, my husband isn't too keen on Italian food so it's been quite awhile since I had enjoyed my favorite Penne Rustica.  On August 19th, hubby was out of town so I decided to treat myself and  I ordered pick up.  The server Jordan was very sweet and had my food all neatly packaged up and ready to go.  When I got home, the food was still warm, so all good so far.  And then, much to my disappointment, the creamy sauced pasta with succulent shrimp and chicken I was expecting was dry dry dry.   There was seriously hardly any sauce at all and the chicken and shrimp were tough.   I couldn't even eat half of it-- was so dry.  SO very disappointing.  Don't know why the huge drop in quality, especially for the price, but I would have to think very seriously about returning.  Again, so very sad.	1.0

Our server, Vivian, was absent along with the rest of the many employees huddled in the back of the restaurant laughing & chatting it up. Our food came out sparse & poorly cooked. I had to send one meal back because it was outright cold. Our servers attention was impossible to get. Our drinks went unfilled. Dirty dishes were scattered across our table even though I did my best to stack them. During the entire hour I saw my server three times. I watched her glance over at the table & make no effort to walk over. When I sent my food back to be reheated, in any respectable restaurant, the manager would have came over and apologized or at least asked how we were doing. While I ate my one biter mozzarella (which was actually considered to be one course of the three course meal. HA!) I found something round and hard which felt like it nearly broke my tooth as I bit into it. It took more time to get my servers attention & get the bill than it did to actually eat my food. Frustrated with my service I asked to see the manager once we received the check. The manager made me wait to see him. Then when he came out he gave no apologies as I explained to him my experience in a calm manner. I never once raised my voice & he offered no discount to our bill. He was impolite & unsympathetic. I also couldn't believe that the server stood beside him listening in as to what I had to say and made smirks as I talked. I've worked in restaurants before and have seen many managers treat guests--clearly trying to get their meal for free--with more dignity than I received today.	0.0
2679	Bs8AvNO3xWoURWpqiGd_4w	1.0	3.0	1.0	"We were trying to figure out where to go for lunch and had recently received an offer for a $7 ""express"" lunch at Macaroni Grill. I hadn't been there in a few years, but my boyfriend remembered it as being one of his past favorites. We decided to give it a try.

We went on a weekday around 1pm. It wasn't super busy. The dining room was about half full, and there were a few people in front of us waiting to be seated. I should have know this wasn't going to be a good experience when I noticed some people being directed to a line on one side of the dining room where I saw a sign for the ""express"" lunch. I really wasn't in the mood to stand in line and order my food. That was one of the reasons we picked there to eat. It was our turn, and the hostess asked if we were going to do full service dining or the express dining. Since we were hungry, we decided we might as well go with it. 

We got to the register and ordered. There seemed to be some confusion regarding the Chicken Caesar Calzonetto when I orderd. The cashier said it wouldn't be ready in seven minutes. I questioned her since it was clearly stated that everything on the express menu was guaranteed in seven minutes or less. After a few minutes, she changed her mind and told me it was guaranteed. Huh? We paid and noticed she put our receipt in a drawer with others. I had to ask her for it. Thought it was a bit odd that we weren't asked if we wanted it and that there was no mention of the fact that the time we placed our order was on the receipt. This was deceptive in my book.

So, off we go to find a table. We were told we could sit anywhere. We found a table. Made a note of the time on our receipt and waited. Hmmmm.....No server. No silverware. No drinks. It's been five minutes and still nothing. Finally someone comes by and asks for our drink order. Our drinks are brought. At about eight miinutes after we ordered, one entree came out. We asked about the other one, and were told they bring them out seperately so they can meet the seven minute guarantee. The other one was brought at about ten minutes after. We realized at that point that we didn't have silverware. I vaguely remembered the cashier telling the people in front of us something about silverware. Off one of us goes to find it.

We also didn't realize we probably needed to order anything extra with our food. We each got a sandwich. Nothing comes with it. If you want chips, salad or a cookie, you have to order that. We were asked if we wanted bread when we ordered, which I thought was odd. I don't usually want bread with my meal when I've ordered a sandwich.

Everyone seemed stretched thin and it was never clear if we had a server or if it was just a group effort to make sure the ""express"" lunch people were taken care of. The server that brought the second sandwich told us that she would talk to the manager about a refund since the seven minute guarantee wasn't met. I will give her credit. Although she was busy, she did take the time to get back to us and even apologized that they didn't meet the time guarantee.  

Honestly, I didn't care that much about the seven minute thing until the cashier put the receipt in the drawer without even a mention. The whole experience was poor for what you would expect from a place like this. The food wasn't that good either. The chicken on the sandwith was good, but there was way to much wrap or bread. My boyfriend ordered the chicken parm sandwich. It was bland. Tasted like it was breaded without seasoning. The ""express"" line was next to the kitchen and salad prep area. Every time a server needed to check on something they had to navigate the people standing in line.

SO much food in the seat it was absolutely the craziest thing! I was so hungry I didn't care and sat down and quickly ordered drinks. The server took at least another 5 mins being weird and long winded and was gone another 10 mins when he came back with drinks but no bread. Only recommendations were the MOST EXPENSIVE items (surprise, surprise). Ordered and GOD DAMN the up-sell is strong with this place!!! Would you like to add this? Would you like to add that... So is that the $12 salad or the $3.50 salad you HAVE to pay for because the entrees don't come with one... ANNOYING... FINALLY got salads after being there for 30 mins already and guess what?? STILL no bread... actually ate mt entire salad and had just gotten up to go find some f&*%&^ing bread on my own when it showed up AT LAST! Food was really good but my lasagna was pretty cold in the middle. The portion was so big it didn't really matter as I couldn't eat it all anyway. Drinks sat empty (in an empty restaurant??).

We were there on a Friday evening at about 8 pm and the restaurant was virtually empty. The hostess wasn't friendly and it took 15 minutes for our waiter to introduce himself. When he did finally show up he bumped into our table knocking the wine bottle over which actually hit my son. Needless to say I was less than impressed at this point. He proceeded to give his speel about dinner specials while belching in between sentences. He took our orders gave us olive oil and said bread would be out but that didn't happen. He took another couples order brought them their salads and bread before we got ours. My boyfriend had to stop him to ask for our food which he finally brought another 10 minutes later.

Our waiter, Jose, was obviously annoyed with us that we didn't want appetizers by his tone and the look on his face. He then proceeded to question my order like he's never heard of it before but in a very rude way. He didn't offer us any wine when we sat down or grated cheese with our meal. The manager wound up bringing our food out and refilling our drinks for us. Jose didn't have but 3 tables of which we were one, and he was laughing and talking with the table next to us so he wasn't having a bad day, he just seemed to be really annoyed by having to be our server? My husband thinks it may be because his other 2 tables were older people who looked like they ordered a full course meal. My husband and I are in our twenties so maybe he just thought of us as kids, at least that is very much how he treated us. I was a server for 4 years and I would have never thought to treat a customer that way, my husband almost said something to the manager but I didn't want to get the server into trouble since its Christmas tomorrow. Regardless we were so disappointed and just felt very snubbed. If we do return, which won't be likely, we will certainly request someone other than Jose.	0.0

This evening's dinner was a disaster!!! We had a table of 12 people which in most cases would mean more than one server to help out. We had half a dozen servers and we still didn't get the food we ordered and the wait for drinks was 40 mins plus. My husband ordered a second beer and it took so long he forgot he even ordered it and by the time the server noticed we were done eating. Once we received our food( which none of us got at the same time) it tasted good. We were about an hour and a half into our dinner at this point. We were ready to leave due to the service been so slow we had decided to go else where to drink (this being a birthday dinner we were all prepared to drink and spend some money) it took the server 40 mins to bring half of the checks which weren't even correct. We also had the free birthday cake that they had given the birthday girl was still charged on the tab. After explaining the problem to the female manager on duty she was not helpful. She just stated it takes time to split the checks not even apologizing for the errors with the service given thus far. After another 20 min wait we received some more of the checks (again not correct) another server at this point stated he had helped and they would be corrected asap. We then spoke to a male manager who just handed it back to the female manager who was no help what so ever again. All in all it was almost and 1.5 horse before the checks were correct. Even after all of this there was no apologies given or no offer the give the birthday girl comped food. It was the most horrific meal experience we have ever had! Never returning and I hope the female manager understands that she lost business for this restaurant from more than just our table of 12. We all will be sure to tell everyone about this experience!!

You could actually see on the rice that it had not been completely cooked with the whiter centers of each grain.

The beef was a massive disappointment, brutally dry and chewy with absolutely no tenderness as good beef would have. It felt like I was eating microwaved leftovers. The 4 pieces of sushi were all tiny, far smaller than average sushi would be, and tasted fairly mushy to boot. They did not have that freshness that one wants from sushi. I asked for wasabi on the side, and rather than bothering to put some in a small plastic container, they just threw a glob of it in the middle of my takeout box. How lazy! Tempura was not even vaguely resembling crisp, and again did not taste fresh, really flavorless and gross. The sauce included for it was tasteless and bland, so that didn't help. At least the salad was ok.

2712	NM3iiGNrwoyNKWXiRT-nKA	1.0	1.0	2.0	"I've one or two good experiences here, but also a handful of not-so-great experiences. I keep coming back because it's the only Asian food in Arizona Center close enough for lunch.

So let's start with the good: Their sushi used to be pretty decent, and for the lunch special, you can get two rolls for about $9, so that's a deal. I've also tried out their ramen. When it was brought out to me, I noticed that the broth looked very creamy, so I asked the server if there was dairy in it. (I know this is a common practice at some Japanese restaurants, so I figured it was best to ask instead of getting sick later.) He told me the soup did contain dairy, and when I told him I was lactose intolerant, he was very kind and offered to make it again in plain broth. I was very grateful for that.

These good experiences were about a year ago. Recently, things have changed: the sushi is no longer reliable, and even though I just about always order the same two rolls, they've been getting my order wrong a lot, giving me the spicy salmon instead of regular salmon roll. (The spicy salmon, by the way, seems like it is probably just chopped up salmon mixed with Sriracha.) Additionally, the ramen has not been as good either. When I ordered it a few weeks ago, I again asked about whether there is dairy in the broth so they can make it plain instead. The girl  taking the order told me it's just miso broth, so I believed her, thinking that maybe they changed the recipe. Well, later, I learned that it definitely had milk in it, so I was not at all pleased with being lied to. On top of that, the veggies and meat in the ramen did not seem fresh. I have never had ramen like that anywhere else. It looked like they took a really bad salad of iceberg lettuce, and basically dumped the veggies in the soup. The chicken too was something else; I'm pretty sure it was the teriyaki chicken without the sauce.

I hope they go back to cooking food the way they used to. It's quite a disgrace to Japanese food the way it is right now."	2.0

I ordered their Pork Ramen, Gyoza, house salad and two spicy tuna rolls. 

I will review the items in the order that they arrived. 

1. House Salad: Prechopped salad with what tasted like bottled peanut ginger dressing. It also has a slew of uncooked noodles on top. It was boring, bland DRENCHED in dressing. Yuck. 

2. Pork Ramen: Miso broth with Pork chunks, noodles, bean sprouts and carrots. The broth was terribly bland. Not even the Miso paste could rise any flavor. The most prominent flavor was of the earthy sprouts and to me they taste like dirt. I had three (3) miniscule pieces of Pork in it. Again, yuck. 

3. Gyoza: Fried, old and greasy. 

4. Spicy tuna rolls: About a third of the rolls has any rice on them. Also, two of the ends had no tuna in them at all. They were also warm and tasted like they'd been out for a while. Ugh.

The volcano roll stated the scallops were baked, so I was expecting a warm soft scallop. They were steamed and very cold. I told the waitress I thought it was warm because it said baked, she said no they are steamed, so I had to show her the menu where it states baked. She didn't offer me if I wanted something new or to take it off my bill as it was a $13 roll. I also asked to add cream cheese in it, and they just put small bits of cream cheese on top of the roll, not even in it.

There were two servers and maybe about eight people including my boyfriend and I and the waitress still forgot to bring us our waters. She took so long to come out and take our order that the sushi chef had to come out and ask us if we were ready to order. When she finally took our order we had to ask for our waters for a second time. She never came back for our refills even though she watched me finish my water and then drink my boyfriends. When we were done eating we sat with empty dishes, waiting for the bill while she stared at us and then continued to clean off the tables. To top it all off she was texting in front of everyone in the restaurant and tried to hide it by going in a corner. She must have forgotten that we were outside and the restaurant has windows around it. 

Needless to say, the sushi is decent but overpriced with mediocre service.

He sounded very knowledgeable and suggested me to take Korean Ramen as it is much firmer compared to Japanese Ramen. I ended up ordering Spicy Korean Ramen since I love spicy food. I waited for almost 25 minutes and the Ramen came in. When the waiter put the noodles in front of me, it just looked like Korean instant noodles that I cook at home. I took the first bite and it was exactly the same taste as what the Instant Korean Spicy Ramen I bought from Asian grocery store. Still, I forced myself to eat at least half bowl as i paid almost 12 dollars for the Ramen which I could easily get for less than a dollar at store. The worst meal I had at Phoenix.	0.0

Half the menu was ""out"", so my first two choices of meal were not available. Ice machine for sodas was out of ice. 

Friend had pad Thai and I tried some. Was a bit bland in my opinion but not horrible. Salad was just greens with dressing, nothing to rave about. 

My food was about ten minutes behind my friends and they tried to say our order was done without my food being out. Got it finally. Had pork tonkatsu. 

The cutlet was dry and overcooked, pieces of it too burnt to eat. Rice was possibly the worst white rice I've ever had and that's hard to mess up. On the other hand, it was so burnt, I'm pretty sure it can't give me food poisoning.

I was afraid to eat the sushi we ordered, but had one piece and it was maybe mediocre. Seaweed definitely stale and chewy and ingredients not fresh.

The doors were locked while we were in the patio and we could not get refills and no one checked in on us. They had a random patron doing the doors for them to let people out. Unacceptable treatment.

I didn't expect much from the ramen, especially it being only $9. Unfortunately for me, I had more to complain about after I received it. The ratio of noodles to broth was 1:3 and worst of all, the noodles were packaged. Meaning they were thrown in absentmindedly before dishing it out of the kitchen and onto the dinner table. The noodles still being stuck together, matched with the alarmingly salty broth was not ramen.

Their fried rice also has corn, which I could do without, and green beans, which is different but I don't mind. A lot of time had passed and my fellow diners still hadn't received their rice bowls. My b/f went up to check on it. They said it was 8 minutes for the rice. What the heck is taking so long? Others who arrived after us had gotten their food...
It was at least 30 minutes between the time I got my food and when they got theirs. That's just crazy. It's not like we were on separate tickets. We were all together on one ticket. I don't understand why they couldn't time it better so our food came out together.
I tried some of the teriyaki chicken and it was very good. Before we left, I saw someone else's fried rice and it looked normal, not dark like mine.

No one complained about the kid, rather, we heard the other inside customers comment about how cute she was, as were we. She had a few cries/squeals, but we hardly even noticed. Then out of no where, this man (blonde ponytail, believe his name is Ace) screams across the restaurant, ""That's fucking enough! Take her outside! Do you hear me? That's fucking enough!""

It went absolutely dead silent. Who I believed to be the father of the child, and I also think he was one of the cooks, took the baby out, and the waitress continued working. The next time she came to our table she was visibly struggling to hold back her tears. We told her to just hang out at our table for a second to catch her breath, and she just stood their crying, and profusely apologizing. It was the most heartbreaking moment. We were there late, they were closing as we were finishing, the were pretty dead, more staff than customers, and the kid hadn't bugged anyone, or done anything wrong. It's a family restaurant, nothing fancy in the least bit. It was very loud in there as is. The kid wasn't out of control, or hurting anything, it was so uncalled for.

Tried searching the Internet for a customer service line & it is not in service. Totally unprofessional if you ask me. They charge way too much for the rip offs they incur on their customers.

I always order the sandwich and it is always meaty spicy and delicious with lots of flavors.  This time around they duped me in the drive thru.  This sandwich is supposed to come with smoked lean ham, Chianti wine salami, spicy sopressa, provolone spicy giardiniera, basil Mayo and fresh arugula.  What I got was so disappointing I may never come back again.  At first glance the sandwich looks like bread and lettuce.  I only got one slice of meat and one slice of cheese and wilty gross lettuce. There was no basil mayo, and a couple of chunks of the giardiniera. The sandwich is supposed to be three meats cheese and ARUGULA.  DO THE SANDWICH MAKERS IN THE BACK NOT HAVE LIST OF INGREDIENTS THAT NEED TO GO ON A SANDWICH?  Paid over $9 for this.  SO VERY DISAPPOINTED	0.0

I don't know if this location is franchised or part of the corporation but I know that it needs some TLC. How do u as managers not walk into your location and take pride in your job. I work at the best breakfast place and the first thing I do when I get to work is look around and determine how would the guest feel if they came in and what might make it better. Your location has gone down hill mighty fast. Very dirty this evening. My family came in at 6:30 and all the booths were dirty( first thing a guest might notice) went to order the most popular salad (Fiji apple) no salad dressing they ran out. Amy came and asked me what soup I wanted and decided to roll her eyes as I asked to try the autumn soup and kept a mad look on her face the entire time she helped me. There was no manager on the floor and the kids were running the place with a lack of guest focus or having polite customer service. If you are part of the corporate chain I would highly suggest u take a little more focus on providing a clean atmosphere as well as having more friendly approachable staff. If you would like to talk more about my visit please feel free to respond. This is all to make u better and grow for more people to enjoy your concept. Remember it's all about the guest and your losing that focus as u transfer into a new but same concept!!!	0.0

For $8.00 I LITERALLY received ONE piece of processed turkey, ONE piece of processed ham and ONE slice of Salome!! It wasn't even a full sandwich, it was a half. I called the manager thinking they must have made a mistake, and..... they didn't. For $8.00 you receive one slice each of processed meat and bread. To the manager's credit he said the sandwich was probably a half when it should have been a whole and he would refund my money if I were to come back to the store. However, I ordered it to-go in 107 degrees, so going back out wasn't my idea of fun. So, for $11 you too can have a small lemonade, a couple pieces of processed garbage on bread.	1.0

When they started dropping the items, I reduced the frequencies of my visits but I continued coming for the flavorless low cal avocado blt sandwiches (hold the mayo and the numbers are almost good) and the yummy cookie. A month ago I stopped by another Paradise that had turned into a Panera. That was the straw that broke the camels back. It was terrible.

If they are turning this into a Panera and are getting rid of the cookies, there is no reason for any Paradise fans to continue visiting.

What they don't have is an idea of what service means. Today I walked in to buy a box of assorted cookies. I walk up to the dessert counter and Dee (supervisor) was busy talking to her manager, they were at a register clearly very interested in their task. I patiently waited eventually Dee broke away to tell me I order food down the counter, as soon as I asked for an assorted box of of cookies she points out a line at the far end of the counter and says ""she has more cookies over there"". I quickly recognized she did not want to assist me. I said thank you and went and stood in the 6 person line. I was asked by the employee at the salad station If I would like a salad and I declined and thanked her for offering assistance. I then asked who the manager is and she pointed out Dee the original person who did not want to assist me, I replied ""of course she is"" and went about waiting in the line. I get down to being the third person in line and the Dee comes over and asks what type of cookies I would like. I don't know if the salad employee said something to her and that spurred her to offer assistance but it was an insincere attempt to correct a missed opportunity. I said thank you but I will wait for my turn in line for assistance from the employee you directed me to. 

I'm very disappointed that Dee felt that the task interaction with her manager was more important than a paying customer. I'm equally disappointed that upon witnessing the interaction the Manger retreated to the back before her name could be noted or she had to work with a customer. 

Overall today's experience was not Paradise Bakery's best example of their ingredients for success:

""Our goal at Paradise Bakery & Cafe is that your experience from the presentation to the product quality to the exceptional service is so special, that you tell a friend, ""You have to go to Paradise."" 

I hope you you receive better service than I did.

As a preface, the mall had opened at 10am, and all other locations in the food court appeared to be open as well.  I walked up to Chipotle, and several employees were standing around.  The lights were on and the food appeared to be ready.  No one acknowledged me until an employee in the food court seating area yelled out to me that they opened at 10:45am.  I looked at my watch, and it was 10:40...seriously?

The service is fast enough and friendly enough but they really REALLY skimp on ingredients here. Given the way Chipotle is set up in a Subway-esque do-it-yourself style you actually get the pleasure of WATCHING your self get screwed over in real time! I had been warned that this particular location skimped on the rice, beans, meat, etc but I didn't really believe it. Well they do, and you can literally watch with your eyes as they spoon 7 grains of rice into your tacos. I wouldn't complain but, it's a problem for people who need to watch their nutrition closely. One of my loved ones has type one diabetes and uses the nutrition data on Chipotle's website to check his carbs for his insulin, but this chipotle have him so little food that his blood sugar was low even after a full meal. That's the degree of deviation from the standard at this particular location. I have to imagine their management tells them to be stingy with their portions, because I don't know why else they would be so consistently. If you want to get what you pay for, go elsewhere.	0.0

I'm not really totally against them per se but I certainly don't love the food enough that getting a $100 card to them will elicit cries of happiness when I could be eating somewhere else. This is especially true if you received this card around the same time Chipotle had their e.coli issues. But anyways, I've had everything on their menu as a result so I know how everything should typically taste like.

The wrapped burritos at this location are fine, they are the same size and the same amount of fillings and taste as other locations. However, the burrito bowl was very stingy on the rice portion. Out of all the ingredients to skimp on, you skimp on one of the cheapest elements? Odd. I could hardly taste it in my bowl.

But for the past year, every time I went in there, the service wasn't very good. The environment was dead and still the waiter wouldn't come to refill our drinks etc very often. I let that slip. 

I tried calling delivery a few times afterwards. They would say it will be there in 40-45 minutes (which is long anyway) but it would not come for at least an hour. One time, it took 1:35 minutes and the ice cream was slightly melted, food was slightly cold, and I was overcharged by 7-8 dollars when the bill should've only been around 20-21. So I complain to the delivery driver. He denies anything and tries to bribe me with a few dollars not to complain to the manager on the phone. I felt offended and that money didn't even cover me being overcharged. I called the manager and he did not help me much at all. He kept saying the menus on his website had old prices, and the stuff I ordered increased. And now there is no free delivery even though it says it on his menu.

1) I ordered the Catfish Panang Curry at Papaya Thai.  The catfish did not taste fresh.  It tasted like it was sitting under heat lamps awaiting someone to order it.  The curry was way too light to be even called curry.  It had no taste.  

2) My wife ordered the Tom Yum.  She said the broth tasted like someone just made the broth with some water and medicated oil (like putting Tiger Balm or menthol in hot water and calling it broth).  It did not taste like broth.  The seafood in the Tom Yum was so chewy (like it was totally overcooked).

Also, this particular location is also the same as Saigon Pho.  They have the same kitchen serving both Vietnamese and Thai.  If you try to be everything to everybody, you do not do well in anything.  Either do Vietnamese only, or do Thai only.  Do not try to do both.  Also pare down the menu to what you do well, and what you do best.  

The waitress was Vietnamese, as my wife, who is originally from Vietnam, picked up the language they were speaking in the back amongst themselves.  I will not write here what the comments they said in Vietnamese according to what my wife heard.  The comments were less then flattering of the patrons in the restaurant.

As we get our check, we tell about the Groupon and they subtract the difference while sitting the check down on a table. 5 minutes pass before it is picked up by the lone waiter and rang out.  No ""thank you"" or ""have a nice day""

The restaurant has two doors - the left door says Thai and the right door says Vietnamese; they both go into the same place. There are two other couples in the restaurant out of 70 seats. We sit down, order our food. Food shows up, it's alright - nothing bad; then it all goes south.

I proceed to ask the waiter, ""I would like to order a Strawberry Boba."" ""A what?"" ""a Strawberry Boba"" ""I don't know what that is, let me go ask the other person.""; very delayed response, I wasn't sure of what to make of the situation. Boba shows up, it's pretty watery and boba is barely in it. Whatever.

I am telling a story to my partner a few minutes later and the waiter is filling up my water, then says ""Wait - what the f--- are you talking about?"" in reference to my story; I laugh, explain the story as best as I can. 

The check comes in, ""Wait, you have a Groupon?"" ""Yeah"" ""Did you tell the waitress about it before ordering"" ""No? It's just a $13 for $24 Groupon"" ""I don't know how to do Groupons, one moment"" and then the waitress comes out. 

The waitress tells me that because the check is totaled for $26.xx and the Groupon only covers $24.xx; I am to pay the rest, simple right? Except she will not accept a credit card because of the credit card fee charge. The waiter chimes in for a quite moment which the waitress fires back ""Shut up, let him talk."" in reference to me. She asks if I have cash, I say No and then proceeds to stare me down in regards what I am going to do for the remaining balance - I am not joking. I end up walking to the Bank of America ATM in the parking lot, withdrawing $20 and go pay the check. We walk out shortly afterwards, laughing."	1.0

I like football but if you want to be a sports bar be a sports bar.  if you want to be a thai restaurant maybe play some asian music?  now on the service.  my girlfriend was given a plate with a hair on it.  probably our waitress.  glad I caught it.  but you gotta be careful of that sort of thing.  only one waitress for the whole restaurant buuuut she only had 3 tables so no excuse for being swamped.  water tasted bad obviously from the tap.  had to ask for refill of thai tea.  took 10 minutes to come.  at the end of the meal.  also the waitress didnt buss a single plate the entire evening so by the end was pretty cluttered.  then comes the creepy buss boy wearing a jack daniels t shirt.  he says 'dont worry i actually do work here' who goes on to explain 'i get it all the time.'  wellllll have you tried maybe wearing a uniform?  trying to be professional?  or at least not creepy and in your face?  to be fair he WAS trying.  but i'd say its the waitresses' job to be friendly and whitty.  not the buss boy.  he could actually be a very good employee if properly trained.  but it seemed like he was the only one who was really trying.  an inattentive waitress.  an over the top buss boy.  another guy who helps with the drinks but when we ask for more rice says 'tell your waitress'  this place is all kinds of mismanaged.  clean up your over enthusiastic buss boy.  put a proper uniform on him and you could have yourself a good waiter.  BEAUTIFUL decorations complete with Buddha statue.  so like I said.  a lot of potential.  but confused on their identity.  and obviously lacking in leadership.  needs better service.  be fast on the drinks.  refills.  clear dishes as they empty dont let them just pile up.  and add some music and commit to your theme and you'll turn this confused experience into one of the cutest and authentic thai restaurants in tempe.	0.0

There was one waitress and she seemed very nice, though she had really odd timing.  We waited about 15 minutes to order, then another 15-20 minutes before our appetizer arrived.  We had shrimp in a blanket, which were tasty.  We had to ask for plates.  And actually, our entire meal, which included a soup, was eaten on the same small plates.  We needed to ask for bowls for the soup.  It was odd.  Our main courses were salmon in red curry, pumpkin curry with chicken, steamed mussels, and pad thai, all at a heat level of 3 (based on a scale of 5).  The heat was pretty true to the scale.  The mussels, salmon curry and pumpkin curry were great.  The pad thai was forgettable.  For dessert we had fried bananas which were really forgettable.

I'll say this: for the most part, the food was really good!  But the service was just terrible.  One waitress, one table of customers, one would think it would be okay, but she was mostly absent.  At one point she brought out one of our dishes and was on her cell phone.  Instead of ending her call, she motioned for one of us to help her with the dish because she couldn't handle it with one hand.  We all just looked at her with confusion and she really seemed oblivious.

We wondered if perhaps the service was so bad because it was a Sunday night, and maybe they just don't get a lot business.  So we may try to go back on a Friday night, or perhaps on a weekday for lunch.  The main course items really were very good, so for that reason we'd like to try again.  If they can stay open."	0.0

So Like most of you on here I like to eat, and I know what I like.

I ordered  one day and the food was wonderful.

But..........

Three days later I ordered the same thing except added an order of orange chicken for another guest.

When we ordered we asked the gentleman who had an Asian accent if they even had orange chicken (which I thought would be weird), and without hesitation the man said ""Yes"".
 When the food arrived before I even took a bite, I knew something was not right.

The shrimp fried rice was waaaaaaay over cooked like mush. I ordered extra shrimp which was non existent. The spring rolls I ordered had nothing in them but shredded lettuce and like 3-4 itty bitty pieces of julienne carrots.

It was so obvious that this wasn't the same food I started wondering if somehow they delivered someone else's food, when I looked in the bag there was a menu from another restaurant called Papaya Thai.  When I saw that I completely freaked out and and called to ask what the hell was going on.

I was advised that there is two restaurants one Thai and one Vietnamese, because I ordered an order of orange chicken my food was made at the Thai restaurant...NOT OK. You don't order or go to an establishment and order one thing and get something else.

I was apologized to by who I assume was an owner and then told I would have 1 free meal......1, even though my order was completely botched and I spent over $50. It was late and after working 9 hours I didn't even care anymore so we threw the food away and we ordered something else for delivery.

3 DAYS later.

I have a brilliant idea to order again and give it another try...DUMMIE.

My 2 orders of shrimp fried rice had 1 shrimp in only one box, my spring rolls were OK, but my shrimp fried rice had stuff in it that was never in the shrimp fried rice I had even ordered before (both times).

This time my boyfriend called and complained and the owner said it was his own fault he messed up our order and that he would comp us two more meals next time we ordered.

HELL NO.... 
We said no, and that we would even bring the food back for a full refund, there was no way we will ever eat here again ever, two free meal would be no use to us. The same gentleman advised us it was not necessary to bring the food back and that if we came in we would get our refund.

So, when my boyfriend goes in there for our money the owner tries to give us $12.... Finally after saying he's not leaving until we get our money back they reluctantly gave us a refund.

.NEVER, EVER  ordering again. Buyer beware.

I work in customer service worst experience ever. I refuse to eat or do business anywhere where my money is only appreciated as long as it stays in their pockets.

I also had the mango curry. This was just OK - I've had much better curries at just about every other Thai restaurant I've ever been to. It was overly creamy and not flavorful enough for my taste. This was evident in the nearly white color - odd for a Thai curry. It also contained almost no vegetables or chicken at all. They essentially gave me a huge cup of milk sauce with a side of rice.

The salad that appeared has the traditional salad ingredients along with ingredients that have no business being in the salad.  Som Tom does not include cilantro.  This version had the green papaya, fresh tomato and fish sauce.  The chile looked to be red chile from Mexico (the seeds are bigger than thai rat chile) and the zing from the lime was not there.

I thought to try this restaurant because I saw it on living social and thought it's a great deal, but it was not worth of time and money. I got an idea, when I saw that we were the only person eating at the restaurant at peak lunch time. Decor is very bad and food was bad and tasteless. I will highly discourage you to try this place if you are look for good thai food.	0.0

service was awful waittress was like what do you want.  and order in 1 sweep including desert.  server was good.  but the staff is poor/

It was somewhat garlicky but mostly just meh. The tofu was tough and the carrots were mostly raw. Boyfriend got beef pad Thai and said it was very greasy and gave him a stomach ache.

When I called to place the order,  I believe it was a cell phone because it went straight to a voice mail.  I called again and a man answered he sounded rushed and kind of annoyed that I was asking for delivery.  He took my order and said it will be there shortly.  50 minutes later I call him to ask if the food is on the way. He asked me what did you order again? So I tell him, he says oh yes my driver on his way 3 minutes ok thank you bye. He hangs up. Another 10 minutes go by and I almost called and canceled then the delivery girl walked in. 1 hour for our food and it wasn't even good. It lacked flavor, the spice was there but it was missing something. The papaya salad tasted horrible it was dry and maybe left out too long.

I got my usual red curry with chicken and he ate the fusion noodles. We also had an order of their egg rolls. The egg roles were good. They tasted homemade. The red curry was terrible. The vegetables were mushy, the chicken was dry, sauce was flavorless and the rice tasted like powdered rice! His noodles weren't spicy even though he ordered double Thai hot and it tasted like old stir fry you make at home with your expiring vegetables (after you've run out of spices to flavor it).

First it took an hour and a half to deliver, when the confirmation email said one hour and fifteen minutes. We were very disappointed from the food - the egg rolls were cold (probably made as soon as the order came in, so an hour and a half until we got them) and came with a very watered-down chili sauce. The soup was extremely oily and actually tasted more like onion soup, nothing like any Tom Yum soup we had before. And the Pad Thai was also very oily and had very little chicken and even less vegetables, for which we paid extra. We ended up throwing away most of the food since it was simpy inedible	0.0

Yes and what I wanted.  Mind you, there is hardly anyone in this place.  She disappeared in the back and I didn't get my drink until about 12 minutes later.

Our reserved table was ready and waiting for us and we had two wait staff moving throughout our group. I was very pleased with my decision to hold it there. As the evening wore on we rarely had service and our guests were ordering from both the happy hour menu and the regular menu; they would have earned quite a nice tip if the service hadn't fallen off. For about our last hour and a half we had to beg for service. We'd flag a waiter down to order then have to beg 30 minutes later to get what we ordered. It was embarrassing for my guests to be treated like this.

When we were ready to go we had go find a waitress to ask for the bill (even though most of the party had departed because they were tired of waiting); that took a while to get. Once we had the bill my father-in-law pointed out to me a gratuity was included in the bill because the size of the party and that was fine. I wasn't please with the service but I still would have left a tip. We put the cash in the bill folder that had been left by departed guests, my father-in-law and I added our credit cards, and then asked the waitress (when she eventually came by again) to deduct the cash and split the bill in two. 

When we got our slips to sign my father-in-law told me not to add a gratuity because he would add more even though there was an included gratuity. I wrote 0 in the tip and wrote the total on the total line.

Fast forward to me doing bills... someone at Gallagher's decided to add their own additional $15 tip on my receipt. This is NOT okay! I realize a big party is tough but the service was terrible and they had already included and included gratuity and my father-in-law added more.

Gallagher's has been the only decent bar/restaurant in the area (besides Amano's, which is excellent but a bit pricey). They used to have good (not great) bar food, but apparently being the only game in the Baseline corridor has softened them. Their burgers were - were - above average. I'm very picky, if you won't serve it medium rare or less I won't bother. But they've gone waaaaay downhill. Now if I order a burger, it will either be well well done or blue rare. Horrible. So I switched to chicken since that's usually...chicken. This evening, I went for takeout, a buffalo salad (quite tasty) and a bourbon swiss chicken burger. They brought me a guacamole burger (though at least it was chicken). Can't eat tomatoes so I returned it. Thank goodness I checked it! Re-ordered the bourbon Swiss burger, received it promptly (good), took it home, sliced it in half, and beheld the pink hue before me (BAD!). It's hilarious that I can't get a medium rare burger, but I can get medium rare chicken! Of course now I'm at home so I guess my dinner is fries. Thanks, Gallagher's. Thanks.

** I wrote that review 3 weeks ago on my phone, but reviews don't upload until you log in on an actual computer (BTW Yelp, I wish you'd change that). Anyway, tonight I was out of options, being in South Phoenix. Well, to be fair I did have fast food options (which I should have exercised, stupid me). Since I had nowhere to go but Gallagher's, I decided I would just get something deep fried and hope for the best, since it's pretty easy to make deep fried food. Silly me. 

I asked for the Monterrey chicken sandwich. Again, I will note that back in the day, this used to be delicious. Now it's an overcooked (ironic, considering my issue a few weeks ago) slab of chicken on a bun. It's supposed to come with cheese, black olves, and ranch dressing. Personally, I think warm ranch dressing is really gross (as is warm mayonnaise, eww) so I asked for ranch on the side. Lo and behold, the sandwich doesn't just have ranch. the bun is literally drenched, it's soggy and disintegrating in the ranch. I'm so diappointed and angry with Gallagher's. It's my own fault for ordering food to go instead of waiting there and sending it back 10 times. Live and learn. 

BTW, yes, my dinner is fries again. I hate you Gallaghers. I hate you. HATE YOU."	3.0

The server... if you hate your job, at least try hiding it... With no one at the restaurant and around 15 tv's on, we requested a specific channel. The manager came to say it's not possible...

I've been coming here for years. The menu has tons of different options, there are plenty of tv's, & the patio is cool with the art & waterfall. The service has never been good, but today was exceptionally poor. 

We arrived as the same time as a bicycling group after completing a race & grabbed a patio table. We were the only people on the patio not from the race. We waited 5 minutes & didn't even SEE a server. I went inside to get a drink & waited another 5 minutes to even be acknowledged by bartender (even though there was only 1 other person at the bar). I asked for 2 beers & she refused to serve me without seeing IDs & my boyfriend was still outside. Ok fine- I understand & comply with the law- but when I expressed frustration that there were no servers outside, she was curt back to me saying there were 3 & I had to be patient. No. You knew this group was coming & failed to adequately staff your restaurant. Your problem, not mine. As a paying return customer I did not appreciate her attitude. It still took 12 minutes to get our drinks & service continued to be poor. I never received the water or toast I asked for- and the manager was beyond annoying when I ordered the toast so maybe it's a good thing I never received it.

Our waitress barley checked on us, but as soon as she dropped off the check she was back at our table within minutes to cash us out.  I am actually surprised I came back after the owner yelled at me the last time when I asked to watch the Tigers baseball game, he yelled in front of everyone ""what is her problem""  um is that anyway to treat your customers?

That is where it ends for me as I exit the establishment.  I have been coming to this place for over four years and have never encountered raw food or  baby roaches.  The waitress immediately took the food back and had to cooks put them back in the oven and called the manager, who by the way was not on the premises at all.  When she was finally about to get in touch with him, he did show up.  He shows up in shorts and a t-shirt like he doesn't have a care on the world.  Now I'm willing to accept that it may be his day off so maybe he just came in to resolve the issue.  What I don't like is when anyone tries to undermine my intelligence like he did.  I cook and smoke various meats all the time and I know what raw or undercooked chicken looks like.  When they brought the wings back out after putting them back in the oven, they still were not cooked fully.  To tell me that they cook the wings for three hours before they are served and then they cooked them again to order before they give them to customers is ABSOLUTELY crap.  To not even address the the fact that there was a baby roach on one of the plates was even worse.  Then you has the audacity to charge us for them.  I am so disappointed in the fact that this is the type of manager that apparently  thinks that this is ok.  I would like to say that the other food was great but I will never go here again.  I never have had this type of service from this site before and best believe I will not ever again, can you say food inspectors and board of health need to drop by soon!!!	1.0

But when 2 people in the party are forgotten completely and no effort is made to make them happy, that is a big deal. The manager even came out and asked if everything was fine, and when we pointed out 2 people were missing their meals, the manager said ""I'll go check on that"" and was not seen again for the rest of the evening.

The food itself was fine, but there's no much the kitchen can do when they don't receive the order.

The next day one of the party checked her statement and found she had been charged for 2 different bills. When she called to get it corrected, the manager told her ""oh, they rang you up wrong but I told the waiter to let you know we reversed the charge."" No responsibility taken.

It had been a few months since we came in and the menus have changed. We started with the chips and guacamole. Guacamole is pretty hard to screw up, but they managed to do it. Completely bland. Just avocado and tomato. No cilantro. No onion. No Serrano peppers. No garlic. No lime juice. No salt and pepper. So disappointing. 

I ordered the green Chile Mac and cheese. Again - completely bland. Cheese sauce bland and not enough green chiles. Had to salt and pepper the crap out of it. 

My husband got the Philly Cheesesteak. Again, completely bland. He didn't even finish  his plate. 

It was pretty dead for a Saturday night and our waiter was terrible. We waited over 15 min to order our food and it only happened when I walked up to the bartender and complained that we hadn't seen our waiter.

 The food is usually pretty good, although the last few times I've had some issues with quality.  However the service is always on point for the most part so I continue to return.  Recently I went with a friend to dinner to catch up and there was a shift change while we were there. The waitress brought one receipt when we had asked to have 2 separate receipts.  She came back and we were so engrossed in our conversation I just gave the waitress my card without looking at the receipt.  My friend paid in cash.  The next morning I saw on my account that I had paid way more than I should have.  I pulled out my receipt and saw that it had both our meals on there.  I called and talked to Mike an afternoon manager and he was very helpful and courteous.  He listened to me and took all my info including the receipt info and looked into for me.  Called me back the same afternoon and told me it would be hard putting the money back on my card, so I asked if I could just get a free salad next time I came in,  he said no problem!  Wrote my name down and I put all the info on the back of my receipt as well as proof of our conversation. 
Fast forward about a week or so later, I decided I would order my salad.  I went to pick it up and the person I talked to got the manager on duty right away which I figured would be a normal procedure, no big deal.  A man introduced himself to me as Jake and I told him what happened and showed him the receipt with all the info Mike had previously given me. He made a face and said the other manager didn't know (know what?  I have no idea) He said that two people couldn't pay for the same thing because their registers would catch that (huh?) And he needed to go check the information out. I was a little annoyed at this point because I felt like he was calling me a liar and I was standing in the middle of the bar area with customers looking at me. He came back with a copy of a receipt that looked like mine but with a different waitresses name and time stamp and said my friend didn't pay for hers and I paid for both meals (how would he know that without her receipt) and that it's OK he'll pay for mine now.  Um,  I saw my friend pay her bill in cash and leave a tip. Whatever I didn't even argue. This experience left a sour taste in my mouth.

I really do want this place to be good because I have had good food and service before. Well, what can I say? It definitely was cleaner but still not great.The trash can was cleaner but still stained with red goo down it. Good Lord, buy a decent trash already.  I went in for Taco Tuesday which is 99cent tacos. So I order, and my total comes to $5-something. So I ask the girl why its almost $6 for 4 tacos. She points to the sign and yes there are new signs with a price increase. Okay, no problem, whatever. I tell her that for almost $6 I would rather have the carne asada burrito. Nobody was doing anything at that point (cooks) and she just looked at me for a second and said ya. YA?? What is that all about? Whatever at this point. So I get my food and it is by far the worst tacos I have ever had there in over two years. Nothing in them and extra greasy crap dripping all over. Well I guess if there is not too much in them, you basically get a grease soaked shell. So disgusting. I am done with this place and maybe if they get their crap together I will go back.

Safeway management you need to get your act together and either close this store or bring in a new, professional team, one that knows how to put the customer first. Now to the longstanding issues:

1. Since Sprouts moved in across the road Safeway management seems to have completely abandoned this store. 

2. It seems to have been always understaffed but the store management up until late 2016 seemed to be doing their best. Since then a string of management changes has only cause the death spiral to accelerate. 

3. Employee moral seems to be at a record low but there are still a few smiling faces. Debbie and Debbie always great you with a smile and Russell does his best to resolve issues.

4. When I need something I normally need to be in and out of the store fast - that is a practical impossibility. Rarely do they have the express lane open. This morning for example I needed two gallons of milk, that is all. I picked them up and headed to the front of the store. One lane open with 6 people in line with several with full carts. Eventually another teller came over and attended those of us in the back of the line. Then miraculously as  the two open lanes thinned out another teller showed up in the express lane but then did not have any customer to serve.  Typical.

5. Prices - produce prices are by and large much higher than Sprouts.

6. Selection - very poor.

7. Maintenance - floors are pealing and patched with ductape, sharp edges are protruding (for months) from several of the coolers causing a potential injury hazard, etc.

8. Given the loss of the excellent bakery manager, most of the shelves of the ""fresh baked"" items are scarce on a Sunday morning. As an example the items that I purchased this morning had been made on the 30th (I should have checked the date) and instead of ""crispy"" were soggy.

9. Now what is totally unacceptable (the blame lays squarely on the shoulders of the current management) was what happened in believe on Saturday the 22 of July. After a long day at our restaurant I walked over (about 9:30pm) to Safeway to pick up some smoked salmon and two other items prior to heading home. I picked up my items and headed to the front. When I got there there was only one teller working. She had a full line (most of which had full baskets). As I walked up I asked one of the other ladies if they could open another line. She said yes and pointed me to the next isle over. I headed over and another man followed me (he had approached the other line shortly after I had). As I put my salmon on the conveyer the teller walked up. I greeted him with ""hi Phil"" (since I am a very regular customer and like to call them all by their name). To which I received the reply ""I AM NOT HERE FOR YOU, I AM HERE FOR HIM!"" with Phil pointing to the man behind me. Shocked, I left the line and joined the long line in the other isle. I was so taken aback that I forgot my salmon (and Phil did not even show the courtesy of passing it over to me or telling me that I had left it on his conveyor, so I went to the back of the store and picked up another packet). When it was my turn with the teller asked asked her to get me the manager ASAP. After finishing my checkout and waiting for about 10 minutes the manager came over. I asked her to step away from the teller area because I wanted to have a private conversation with her. So we headed to the area between produce and floral. As I stated to tell her what had transpired Phil came up behind me and joined our conversation. I said that I had not asked to speak with him but he stayed there anyway. As I addressed his conduct he started rolling his eyes at me and waiving his hands. I told the manager that this was unacceptable, that he should not be there and they they should look at the cameras and see what had transpired. I also asked that the GM give me a call. I went back on Tuesday morning and asked for the manager. He was not there but I was promised a call. I waited all about noon and called the store for the manager. Was told that he was in a meeting but would call me back shortly. That did not happen. Late that afternoon, I called again and finally spoke with him. No apology, nothing. 

I hope that somehow, someone at Safeway (who cares about customer service, the future of this particular store and has just a little bit of clout) reads this review and actually does something to improve this location. I like the convenience of having them next-door."	1.0

Another hour later after it still didn't arrive I called again and they informed me it was delivered to an address that was not on my order. Informed them that was incorrect, and still had no pizza. They then said Oh yea, we haven't done this order. Cancelled order, informed $ would be back in my account 5-7 business days, still nothing. I called to find out what happened and told a GM would call me back. Still no refund or phone call. Their online ordering forum does not seem to be a good way to get a pizza you ordered.

Ordering online forces you to give roughly an hour grace period. For example, I placed my order at 6:00 and could only request it as early as 7:00. My pizza arrived at 7:30, even after the hour long grace period the establishment had to have my order ready to be delivered on time. Also, it's worth noting that this was a Thursday night.

My delivery driver hands me my pizza and takes off. I come to find it wasn't the pizza I ordered, so I call the store to let them know about the wait and wrong pizza. I am told the delivery driver will turn around with the right one.

Admittedly, I had started eating the other pizza for two reasons. First, I had been waiting a while and was starving. Second, I didn't expect they would actually want the pizza back to then go deliver it to someone else, as there is almost no way it was going to be warm at that point amongst other concerns.

The delivery driver expected the wrong pizza back so he could then take it to someone else. The fact that this was a viable option in solving the great pizza mixup is alarming.

The main issue I had with the 4 topping pizza I bought was the placement of the toppings. It's my biggest pizza related pet peeve when you spend over $20 on a pizza with 4 toppings and half the slice is just cheese. And I don't mean that the ingredients took up half of the space on the slice overall. No, I mean that if you cut the slice in half at the middle, the bottom half of the slice had some toppings and the top half was just cheese. Some of the slices had more of one ingredient than the other, or barely any of one of the ingredients at all. There's just no excuse for that. All toppings should be spread evenly throughout the entire pizza. And the sausage seemed like the pre-cooked, frozen crap you would find on a Dominoe's pizza.	1.0

So, I get off work late one night and get a call from my boyfriend and his friends who have been drinking and ordered a pizza from Gus' to be delivered. He tells me that they never got the delivery or a phone call or anything so they called to see what happened and the manager told them that the delivery driver tried calling them 4 times with no answer, to which my boyfriend replies they never got a call. So, instead of maybe saying ""hey, let's see if we called the right number"" the manager proceeded to HANG UP ON MY BOYFRIEND. Hmm that's some interesting customer service. This pizza is paid for so they call back and say they would like what they paid for to which the manager says ""you have 45 minutes to pick it up or it goes in the trash."" So I end up giving the boys a ride to the store to pick up their ice cold pizza only to find out the delivery driver did not read the phone number correctly. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? These guys were trying to be responsible and have pizza delivered after they've been drinking but instead I have to drive them to the store to pick up their pizza after being hung up on and treated poorly?

They did however, offer a free slice of pizza for anyone who gave them a good review. Ethically, this is flawed, but since I enjoy the place I didn't mind.

Since then, they have been nothing but trash. I received a $20 gift card from them for showing up on opening day for their new location. The card did not work, and Gus' refused to do anything about it; jerked around with handling the situation.

I haven't had this pizza in years - I have no idea how long - well over 10 years.  My current gripe with them is the constant flyers that used to appear on my gate each week.  They stopped for a while after I bitched to my Property Management that over-flyering was not necessary given that half of them would end up fallen off our front gates and blown around the grounds.  It was like the dorm with all this non-stop flyering. There's 180 units in my condo community ...they were flyering nearly EVERY WEEK, and a lot of the ground level condos have 3 gates (front patio, side patio, and back patio that's on the side of the building), and the idiot flyer guy can't figure out that a side gate, and/or a back gate that doesn't have unit number above it, doesn't need a flyer, but some condos would often get flyers on two gates, and on some rare instances, all three gates had a flyer.  I did a rough estimate about how many flyers they were leaving in my condo community over a year ...it was well over 9,000 flyers a year.  Are you f'ing kidding me Gus' ? Finally the flyering stopped after I endlessly bitched to my HOA, but then the flyers resumed again a few months later.  Eventually, they stopped again about six months later and currently I haven't seen a Gus flyer in months.  

Hey Gus', we know where your crappy establishment exists if we need you, but I would NEVER order from this place based on polluting our condo community with weekly flyers ...and secondary to that, the hour+ wait time to get average pizza ...NEVER will I bother ordering from this place. It was a sh!thole in 1996 when I was in college, and it still is 20 years later.  The original location was a dump, but they moved over to the former Geno's cheesesteaks joint arond 2014, so I'm guessing the place is cleaning because that Geno's location was fairly clean and the interiors weren't the dump that Gus' old location was ...but guess what, I still will never order from this Sh!thole.

Another lady sitting at the table next to us, received pretty much the same service we did ... poor.

Our lunch ordered didn't require anything that needed a long time to fix.  What's to do on a soup and tuna salad?  We were just about ready to walk out when she finally delivered our order.  

The soup was absolutely excellent.  Bread was a tad stale but still good.  However, when the service is this bad, it ruins the whole meal.  Why hasn't the management done something about their poor service reviews?  Obviously, there was no tip."	1.0

It lists cheese, relish, mustard and a few other things. I asked our server if it was nacho cheese or shredded cheese. She said either or. As I go to pay the tab says $1.99 for cheese added to our hotdogs. I explain to the check out lady that it was a mistake the menu says includes. She then has to go speak to her manager. She comes back and tells me she cannot remove it, it included a shredded cheese not a nacho cheese. Not only does the menu not state what type of cheese but the server didn't even specify. Most would just roll over because it's only $2 but I was in a feisty mood so I continued to argue. Finally a manager comes over and TELLS me not explains to me why it's an up charge. I TELL her back that it is crap they should be specific and our server said it was fine. 10 minutes later she took the sliders off all together. I wasn't asking for that just the $2 so that is why they get a 1 star. After all that I go to pay and she asks me how everything was....... ""Actually it wasn't even that good"" was my answer. So more importantly don't eat here because the food is basically terrible."	1.0

The large image behind the truck and his whiteboard suggested fresh thin cut fries. But the fries he was setting up was from a frozen bag and they weren't thin cut at all, just large soft fries that he had to prepare the oil to deep fried them on. He also took a long time just getting prepared to make my grilled cheese. 

In short, he was very disorganized and at least 3 people who were waiting on him to take new orders, left. He spend almost 10min working on my food, he didn't bother to take new orders. He was the only person running the truck. 

The fries were bad as expected and the grilled cheese tasted funky. He didn't used american sliced cheese, but used shredded cheese. He also used 2 regular size breads you get at Fry's. For these two orders, I paid $12.50. 

In addition, his idea of curry meal on the whiteboard showed a large plate nicely prepared with the toppings. I saw a guy ordering it and he got a small Styrofoam bowl with some premade curry served in it. That cost him $6.

They said he should be there any minute, because he left at 7:49. We live within three miles. He showed up ten minutes later and look stoned out of his mind.

She told me out would take 1 hour for delivery so I opted for the 20 min pick up instead. Not quite 20 mins later I was there to pick up my order of pizza and breadsticks. I could tell when they showed it to that it wasn't MADE 20 mins ago. It had been SITTING since 20 minutes ago. I asked when it came out, the guy shrugs and says ""I don't know like 5 minutes ago"" . I say screw it and come home. My pizza is dry, over cooked, NO SAUCE WHATSOEVER and burned crust. Not to mention, I have to warm up ALL of my food, breadsticks included, and I only live 4 minutes away, with traffic . Needless to say, they'll be hearing from me.

The last time we ordered 48 wings and received only 20 some wings. We called and they were apologetic and immediately replaced the order and credited the full total of the order because of the inconvenience.

It's been awhile since we ordered but we did tonight to have the exact same experience. Ordered 48 wings and we received 28. We called the location and was first told it was impossible that we didn't get all the wings. I told the Assistant Manager (she's an ignorant piece of work) that I had actually counted the wings because when I received them from the delivery guy I even said this wasn't the correct quantity. She said it would be a hour before they could replace the order. It only took about 35 minutes to receive the first order. Basically, there was no rush to fix the problem, no apology, and she actually thought the situation was funny. We decided that they could come pick up their 28 wings and give us our money back. The response was that we would have to come into the location because their system cannot do credits because it's too old. 

We drove the 6 miles to return the order and get the refund simply because of crappy customer service. When the assistant manager was giving the credit she stated ""the wings are so small now from the manufacturer that they fill up the container."" WHAT??!!! So she is basically saying regardless of quantity you only get half an order anyway? Ridiculous. 

They obviously do not know how to count since it is clearly obvious that 28 wings looks completely different from 48 wings.

Stay away from this place, and if you order wings make sure you count them because if not you probably didn't get everything you paid for.

I immediately called Domino's, completely flabbergasted, they gave me a ""corporate number"" (in quote because no one called me back, I'm sure it was fake)... flash forward.. the same girl just delivered to my neighbor, HOW IS SHE NOT FIRED?!?!

When no one had shown up by 11:45, I called and they said the driver had just walked out the door and would be there in a couple of minutes.  I called again at midnight and the person did seem baffled that the driver wasn't there so she would look it into it and get back to me.  A couple minutes later, the driver showed up at our door, basically threw the pizzas at me and took off.  As she was leaving I looked at the pizzas and both were wrong.  I called the store and she said to hold on and she would try to catch the driver.  She got back to me a couple minutes later saying the driver is gone and she gave our pizzas to someone else, then she offered to make me the pizzas we ordered.  At this point I was fed up, I had 2 pizzas that I didn't want (and my wife couldn't eat because neither of them were gluten free) so I told them I wanted my money back.

The host was not very nice and when my boyfriend asked her to repeat what she had said she said ""nothing"" which till this day we don't know what she said! Anyways we got our food and drinks nothing fancy the wings are overrated there, they really are not tasty at all. So at half time we decided to leave and we were splitting the bill between 3 people I told her exactly what amount should be charged to each card and she came back with our receipts we signed and left. So a couple of days after I look at my online statement and saw that they charged me $30.00 when my bill was only $15.00! (I tipped her like $2) I immediately called them and transferred to a manager by the name of jesse he was very short and not concerned with what had happened he just said to give him the last 4 of my card and my number and to call back the next day. I was really busy so I called back a couple of days later and spoke to another manager by the name of Enrique he was a little nicer and told me he would make some calls and call me back later which he NEVER did!! It has been over 2 weeks now and they have not gave me my money back! Seriously what can you expect from a place like this but still they shouldn't be stealing people's money. Will definitely NEVER come back her especially my family that would come frequently to watch the football games. Loosing a client for $15.00! 

UPDATE!

Called them again since I never got a call back! Spoke to Jesse AGAIN gave him all my info and explained the situation again. He looked at the receipts that day and said that I had tipped $15 that's why they charged me $30!!! Wtf!! I let him know I did not do that like why would I tip my full amount her service was not good at all and even if she was I would never tip the full amount of my bill! He said he would wait until his GM would come in and SEE if they could reimburse me my money! I am just in disbelief this ""waitress"" changed what I had on the receipt. She was skinny, not too short with blonde hair and that day had red lipstick. I know most of the girls look like that but I will find out her name and make sure she faces consequences for what she did! Waiting on jesses call to see if they are going to reimburse me."	0.0

Now it's where you are lucky to get your waitress to pad by you and get another drink I don't mean to be the guy who gives an awful review but wow! I'm here for like 30 minutes and can't even get a refill on my coke the food is crazy greasy even for wings.

We were trying to kill time and had a gift card sho why not? Hooters.always seems to give us amnesia. We always think hmmm. Hooters sounds awesome let's go, since we forgot just how bad it was last time. So this time I can at least say we had prompt service... which as you know is impossible unless you look like the type of a twenty to thirty something male who is a sucker for Orange booty shorts. Either way, it was quick.... almost suspiciously so for Hooters. We were killing time as I said so we started with the lots o tots. Crappy and oddly delicious as usual. Then we ordered a twenty piece boneless wings. Umm heres the deal.... what came out again suspiciously fast was not anything that resembled chicken. What we consumed actually treated nothing of poultry or even greasy saucy battered crispness. Nay, what we.managed to consume was cold, stale, probably reheated several times, broke my tooth, was hacked into tiny pieces, and literally splintered in your mouth. It cut the roof of my.mouth to hell. This is quite literally one of the worst meals I've ever had ... ever. (And if you knew my.father in laws cooking that says a lot). We actually left instead of continuing to order more food (we didn't even use up the gift card balance) on the way out we noticed that there was a sign for all you can eat wings. This irked me for two reasons 1. If I would have known that prior to actually tasting my did, I would have ordered it. 2. That was probably the reason or did was so awful. They probably.Just.make pieces hacked up.and let than sit until used.

The service. The cleanliness. The food. 
It's just ridiculous. The first time I went to this location we sat there for 20 minutes, with not even one person asking if we need drinks. We had to keep asking over and over again who would serve us. They kept saying they have to find someone for our ""section"" yet right next to us, behind us, in front of us there were full tables...get this....with servers. Even a couple sat next to us and they got drinks and food before we did. Like wtf. Eventually we got assigned multiple waitress, but probably 30 minutes later!!! 
Now yesterday. It happened again. They didn't know who was assigned our table. Why even seat us? There were many open tables. After talking to many servers, because we were next to their POS station, finally we got a hostess to help us. Yet. She didn't. She didn't know what beers were on happy hour. She didn't know if they had Kilt Lifter. She didn't even know about ""The Beer of the Month"" she told us she couldn't serve us because she was a minor. Which is understandable but when the whole table wants beer there is no reason for her to help us out. She kept laughing at our frustration. So we left. Because there was no way we would wait and be patient like the first time we visited. What's even more upsetting is reading the reviews and seeing how many stars this place has, yet no improvement is being made.

I asked her if we could sit outside and she pointed us to a table and handed us some menus.  After we cracked open the menu a man (manager maybe) came over to us and told us that our table was needed and we'd have to move.  The server/hostess was still out there and watching the situation.  I asked her where else we could sit and she shrugged her shoulders and said ""I'm sorry, we have no more tables.""  If this were any other restaurant, I would expect a little more foresight from the restaurants employee like, ""it will be a 15 minute wait to seat you"" or ""just a moment while I clear off a table for you"" but it's Hooters.  Since we were asked to leave our table with no other options presented to us, we left but I was super happy that it turned out to be a win-win!

There were several young Hooter girls standing by the front door and one named Kate G was super sweet, put our name on the list, showed us to the bar and checked on us after we ordered our beverages. Sadly the manager Jessie has THE WORST manners of any manager of a restaurant we have EVER encountered!! He was a huge jerk!! We were at the bar ordering our drinks and he told us, ""move! You need to be outside."" I tried very nicely to explain we just ordered our drinks then we would be more than happy to relocate. He kept telling me over and over to move that I could not stand there (under the sign that says ORDER HERE)! Finally he puffed in my face and walked away. After relocating outside Kate G was super nice and checked on us. While drinking our beverages and observing the operation we decided this place was not organized, the manager was still a jerk to me (saw me walking towards him on my way to the bathroom and nearly ran me into another patron).

I only came in here because I was on my way to the concert at Gila River Arena and figured Westgate would be swamped and I was starved and had to use ladies room. I ordered the boneless buffalo, I did not know it was all you can eat but knew I would only eat 1 plate and had to pricing mixed up. I thought it was 12.99 for both my sister and I. That is not a good deal unless you eat 2 or more plates of the wings. So I get my boneless wings and they are heavily breaded which makes them more like popcorn chicken from KFC and there is no flavor on them. If there was any buffalo sauce it was very little.  I should have sent them back but we were in a hurry so I ate 6 out of 8..small meal. They are also out of the beer I want so I had to order 2nd choice. So the bill comes out and they charge me 12.99 for the wings. I sent it back saying I was confused on the pricing and since I only ate 6 anyways I would have been better off with the 6.99 for 6 which I was going to order anyways. They charged me 9.99. oh well I accepted that. So I gave her my card and when I signed for it, I see she charged me the orig amount. I sent the bill back and asked why I was charged the orig bill and she said sorry it was a mistake an reran it again.

While we were standing I counted 4 tables free to the right, and 7 tables to the left. The tables were left dirty and were not bused. So this has me very confused because 11 tables were available but they weren't bused.

I told the hostess that the 30 minute wait is bullshit because from where I'm standing, I counted off the tables available.

She acknowledged the free tables, but gave the excuse the kitchen is backed up.  That's not my problem, wouldn't it be nice to allow us to sit and have drinks for a while? The light clicked on and she agreed to sit us.

Our waitress was very nice and apologized ahead of time for delays from the kitchen. We ordered appetizers, and beer. The appetizer came out really fast. We ordered our meals shortly after going through the appetizer.

I ordered the Cobb Salad and chili. Chili came out with the rest of my tables food, but the salad did not make it. She said she was heading back to grab the salad. 1 bowl of chili later I was told that the kitchen ran out of mixed greens, but someone had ran out to grab mixed greens from somewhere. She did bring some fries to the table to hold me over, thank you I liked that.  By the time the salad arrived my party was ready to leave.

I can't remember our waitress' name but she made a bad situation better by keeping me in the loop, and hooking me up with some fries. The blame lies directly with the manager of this restaurant. He should be demoted and forced to rinse mixed greens for the next ten years.  Asinine having people wait when there are available seats to be filled.   Instead we were left to stand by the door staring at empty seats like a bunch of gibonni's.

We got our food and sat down. My husband bit into his egg roll and there was a cockroach INSIDE the egg roll! Absolutely disgusting! He went to throw up while I requested a manager. After 5 mins of waiting and no manager, we went to the front! We were told the manager on duty was ""on his way to the restuarant!"" We request a refund just to be told that no refunds may be given without manager approval! We said if we don't receive our refund then we will show and tell everyone what we found in our food. She was then ready to give us our refund! Her story sounded like such a lie. Sounds like the manager leaves everything to his employees. Every business MUST have a manager on duty!! I am disgusted!

BUT BUYER BEWARE!!!!!! DO NOT GO HERE!!!!! I and my friend got SEVERE food poisoning (and I am sure many others that day). Nausea, muscle weakness, the inability to focus and thus work and diarreahh and the whole 9 yards
For your own health's sake, do not come here!!!! It is not worth it!!!  I am vegetarian so I didn't even eat any meat and still got food poisoning. this is how unsanitary this place is!  I will be reporting them to the AZ health board. I am from CA and am not sure how this place is still running as I read someone else had gotten food poisoning as well... maybe the health standards in as are just not as strict in AZ. this place needs to be shut down!!!

I have, and still would give its sister restaurant in Albuquerque 5 stars, however this must be the runt of the family. I seriously thought I was in for a good time, but I was quickly shown that I wasn't. My wifes Mongolian grill entree was burned, the sushi was warm, and most of the entrees were a mix of sogginess and saltiness. Dont get me wrong.

Service workers had dirty hands/fingernails. When hubby was at the grill where you get together what you would like them to grill up for you, the worker drenched the utensil (that patrons are to use to pick up raw fish) with raw fish and its water. Food was not great, not even good.

Keep in mind I said style because Asian buffets do not normally include enchiladas and beef soup also known as caldo de res. Anyway, most of the people there were Hispanic so I assume they are catering to their guests.  The best I could say about some of the food was that it tasted okay.  There was nothing to be desired or make me want to go back for more.  This was the first buffet that served me a burnt Mongolian dish.  Most of the food was not labeled.  Since I have eaten at several Asian restaurants it was not difficult to navigate through the dishes.  There was a problem with the cleanliness of the bathroom.  Also, there seemed to be broken drawers underneath some of the food, which exposed the pipes underneath.  I was concerned that roaches may start their own buffet.  Some of the people there did not know where the ketchup was.  I found it in the salad section and it was definitely not Heinz!  The price of $37.00 for lunch on a Saturday was okay but i would expect more from a buffet.  The only icecream they had is actually frozen yogurt and it came out partially melted. The pizza was generic.  This was the first place that ruined chinese donuts for me.  It is kind of hard to mess those up but this place did.  Good Luck and remember you don't have to take me word for it!	0.0

Not bad for less than $15 for a dinner that serves seafood like sushi and steak along with a Mongolian grill. Our server Saul was great at refilling our drinks and even getting us A1 sauce for the steaks. But moving on now to the nitty gritty review... The chow mein noodles were over cooked and lacked salt. The salmon was too salty, I had to drink my soda to get the taste out of my mouth. There were two coworkers canoodling by the dishwasher area as we can see by where we were sitting (a blonde girl and a Mexican guy), they later disappeared after what seemed like 10 minutes to the back away from their coworkers who, were cheering this couple on instead of letting them know to keep their professionalism on point! Now that was a huge disappointment!!! Like how can management let that happen?! I didn't mind that the Chinese ladies who didn't speak English bumped me and my purse fell to the floor without apologizing but how disgusting is that? The professionalism was out the window on this one. I hope these two workers are reprimanded for their awful behaviors! We are not coming back to this business again.	0.0

I first went to use the men's bathroom, which looked and smelled like it hadn't been cleaned in days, though an attendant walked in with a broom, cleaning sprays and fresh rolls of paper towels just as I was exiting.  On my way back to our table I noticed all of the dining room carpeting was stained gray-black and replete with small food particles/debris, as if it had been vacuumed with a vacuum cleaner with a broken belt. The buffet food on the steam tables was so-so at best, with many of the breaded chicken dishes so overcooked you could chip a tooth on your stir fry.  The sushi was almost inedible, despite being freshly prepared, tasting like it was made from thawed frozen fish just about to turn.  Neither of us tried the Mongolian bbq.  Given the price of $12 per person for lunch with drink and tax, I have to declare that there are numerous other Chinese buffets around the metro area offering better food in a much cleaner setting.  Thus, I can't imagine ever returning to Lin's.	3.0

So, about 6 hours later, I kneeled down before the porcelain goddess and gave her all that I had 8 times in a 36 hour period of time. Bad fever and stomach pains. My other issue is that Lin's is anti-gun and is right in the middle of the ghetto at 75th and McDowell. They have signage posted basically advertising that it's a great spot for those that have criminal intent. First time and last in there.

Upon a visit back to Phoenix and to Lins Chinese buffet I was surprised to discover how much they've let this place get ran down. 

The appearance of the outside was enough to keep me away. Their edge of the parking lot was filled with tons of trash and sidewalks leading into restaurant was of dried stains everywhere. 

They really need to spend a day cleaning up outside picking up all the trash and power washing the sidewalks and parking lot. 

Then invest in making this a habit maybe weekly. 

Once inside the restaurant, they seemed short handed with waiting staff as there were plenty of seats available but we had to wait 20 minutes to get seated.

Basically, the food is all over the map - I don't generally go to a chinese buffet to eat old pasta in watered down ketchup, or visit the taco bar (really?) Of the chinese food, 3 of the dishes were variants of ""meat with wilted broccoli"" and 2 variants of ""odd-tasting chicken in some kind of syrup"".  Seriously, that was the full extent of the chinese-related entrees on the buffet.  Some other lowlights:

a large pile of wrinkly old green beans that looked like they had been cooked in a deep fryer
3 kinds of nasty-looking, picked-apart fish in puddles of grease
teriyaki chicken slices swimming in 5/8"" of grease
breaded, deep-fried, syrup-drenched rotten (as in ""not safe to eat"") chicken
""pork tamales"" (seriously, wtf?)

More importantly, as a former chef I'm surprised the health department hasn't swooped in - every single dish was served lukewarm at best, there was no steam rising from the steam tables, and the cold trays were also at room temperature.  The nastiest thing was the tray with a lukewarm pile of old, crusty tuna salad on it - all I can say is that it was foul and i hope nobody actually ate it or the oysters next to it...  

After seeing all this, I definitely avoided the sushi bar and mongolian grill - no use in tempting fate.  Overall, I was so grossed out that I only ate one plate before leaving (for the record, I'm a biggish guy, usually I will chow down 3-4 plates at a good buffet).

In short, I know that there really are no good chinese buffets in Phoenix any more, but this was absolutely the worst food I have ever experienced anywhere in the city.  Worse yet, their lack of sanitation and temperature control makes dining into a russian roulette game for your GI tract.  Hopefully they get shut down before they kill someone."	2.0

About the only thing I thought had improved was the hot and sour soup which was actually quite good. Alas, nothing much else was up to snuff. The pot stickers were large but the size was more due to their thick and bulky wrapper. Like the other dishes they were lukewarm even though we were there at the noon hour peak. The fried rice was OK but the Kung Pao chicken was bland and a couple of the other chicken dishes seemed greasy. The sweet and sour chicken was OK if you like that dish. Didn't bother with the spring rolls and I'm not a fan of sushi so I have no opinion on those. The ice cream selection was good and decent quality. Service was adequate although they were a little slow in picking up the dirty dishes. Probably won't be back anytime soon.	0.0

Of course, since I came in alone with a book, I was seated in the darkest dining area next to a table with screaming children. This should have been my sign that the staff already knew I was not their target clientele and were determined to extract my $14 with the least effort to themselves. 

Standard Chinese buffet food must come in vast tubs from Sysco, as the Chinese dishes are absolutely identical to the Chinese dishes at every other mediocre buffet in Phoenix. This one appears to have a larger selection of non-Chinese food, including the mysterious pork tamale mentioned by others. It all tastes as if it was poured from its tub into a pan, heated through, and then trotted out to sit on its warming table. If you're determined to stuff mass quantities of food down your gullet, this will probably do the job. If you have the food sensitivity that gives stomach cramps in response to one or another cheap fat or filler, don't even walk in the door. There's fast food elsewhere in the parking lot that'll fill you up for half the price and a fraction of the misery.

The iced tea has no flavor that would confirm it's anything other than maybe used dish water, so I suppose I shouldn't complain about lack of refills. Lack of knives is more of an issue if you're recklessly served yourself a slice of ham, but. . . don't. It should be impossible to eff up buffet ham, but the ham was tasteless, with a bizarre gummy texture. After that, I was not about to try the sushi.

High points for food were the spicy squid whatevers, the breading-and-fish concoctions in assorted seashells (those have to be pretty awful before I don't think they're adorable), and the fake tiramisu squares (standard buffet fare but this was a fresh batch)."	2.0

I don't expect great food at a Chinese buffet, but this stuff was below my meager tipping point. The sushi was not rolled tight enough - fell apart too easily. The honey chicken was little cubes swimming in a horrible sauce with lots of canned pineapple chunks. Sauce was thin and I couldn't detect any honey in it. 

When I first approached the buffet, they just dumped some fresh fried fish in the pan. I jumped on that. Too bad, since the fish inside had no flavor, the crust was a big shell surrounding a small piece of fish, and the whole thing was greasy. 

Spare rib chunks had no flavor, and had bits of cartilage that are not familiar to me in pork ribs - maybe it was water buffalo. 

And finally, the thing they called peanut butter chicken was just gross. One strip I couldn't even get my fork to cut through it. And greasy! 

Waited forever for my check. Was ignored for twenty minutes, even though my plates had be taken and I told her I didn't need any more water. She finally brought the check when I was paying. Should have just walked out.

My fiance was eating alone when he noticed a man with his arms crossed who worked there staring at him right outside the door. Like he wasn't even trying to hide it. My fiance notices and looks right at him and he just stares him down with his arms crossed until another man approached the worker. The waitress even gave us our checks early and my fiance and i were not even done eating and she would come by and peek at us, trying to force us out not in a forward way.

The place does have freshness issues.  I made a decent enough taco but the salsa was obviously old.  When that's one of the first things you taste, it makes you a bit skeptical about everything else.

No rice cooker?  The white rice is put into a smallish bin that's usually low in supply.  The fried rice has an artificial look about it (bright colors?) and doesn't have much in the way of taste.  You don't have to have the best fried rice in the world but in the buffet game you have to make sure you don't have the worst.  

Lots of chicken dishes, but I made the mistake of biting into a big piece that had lost most of it's coating, and it was a bland experience.  The kind of bland where it makes you think about how processed this food is.  Not a good reminder while eating.

The pizza just looks bad, the kind where the red sauce is just drying away.  I have such a low threshold on pizza quality that Totino's gets me excited, but what I saw at Mandarin didn't make me want to allocate calories to it.  I did try the famous tamale and it reminded me of the Hormel canned tamales.  Just reminder after reminder of the processed food....

That toppings being pineapple, mushrooms, jalapeño, and pepperoni. I might as well have ordered a cheese pizza and put the toppings on here at home.

So I called the store. The manager asked if I wanted a replacement, adding that the remainder of the pizza needed to be returned.

Last night I visited this location near 44th St and Thomas and was extremely disappointed with the experience.   In the past my favorite dish had been shrimp with pasta (forgot the exact dish name), as this was served in a large, indented serving bowl and the portion size was very generous.   This time I ordered a new menu item --  Shrimp and Broccoli Cavatappi, which was delicious, but they totally skimped on the portion size, as there was very little pasta and shrimp - - seemingly a child's portion -- and I had to order some soup afterward as I was still hungry.  My aunt had ordered the Cedar Grilled Lemon Chicken, which she found to be dry, bland and overcooked.   Then unfortunately, there was the deplorable service.  The hostess that served our party was very slow to respond to our requests for additional food items and cutlery.   The server had forgotten all about my soup and had to put the order in again, and my sister-in-law had asked for an extra knife, but after 10 minutes she had to go up and look around for an extra knife herself.

As to applebee's in general. They change the menu often but everything just has no punch, no wow, no ""I have to have this again"". They push drinks and deserts to the point of being obnoxious. 

We were given a gift certificate to here, and gave it to some people we know who are not as picky as we are. They were not impressed either.

We are all server so we understand a bad night but seriously it was really uncomfortable in the place. All the servers and host giving each other dirty looks. The food took a while to come out which I get sometimes the kitchen is slow. New cook, under staffed whatever not to big of a deal the issue was our server. I don't know if she had a bad case of resting B**** Face or what but she just seemed like she was annoyed with our existence. This is when it really gets bad about half way through eating my burger I got stabbed in the mouth by something sharp when I pulled it out it was a bone! Now I'm not the one to complain about my food and it was really good up till the end so I just ate the fries and was just done with the burger. ( I was to grossed out to finsh.)

When going in the staff is nice, but after 15 minutes we finally had someone come and ask for drink orders, and a few minutes later they appeared. He didn't return until 24 minutes later to take our order. The appetizers had clearly been sitting out as the dips had dried up on the top. The food literally took 47 minutes to come out after they finally came to order it. When it did come, the orders had some of our requests (sauce on the side, no pickles on the burger) wrong. And ultimately, after 3 hours there, I said my friends should say something, to which they replied that it had been far worse in the past. But for now, don't go.

The only good thing about this restaurant was the hostess, after that everything else went downhill. My server was very untidy and she took forever to get my food. She looked like she had just finished her day shift at a pizza shop and forgot to change her dirty apron which was caked with white dust. Brought me a meal different from what I ordered and didn't have the guts to apologize for it. The food came on a skillet which was supposed to be sizzling but it was cold. Very unappetizing with overlooked onions and a very tiny piece of meat. Place wasn't that busy so I fail to understand why it took over 30 min to get my food. And it looked like a dog had passed on the food then it was brought to me. When she asked me how the food was, I told her that it wasn't what I ordered and she just rolled her eyes. I was tired and didn't want to start fussing with her so I just paid and left. But one thing I can commend about the restaurant is the fact that when I requested for my check, it came in less than 30 seconds. This is the worst Applebee's experience I've ever had in my life and I don't think I ever want to go to an Applebee's if this is the kind of service I get. Over to you Mr. Applebee's CEO.	2.0

Then while we were sitting 25 minutes waiting for our food we noticed another customer at the bar trying three times to get the manager and the bartenders attention by waving. They didn't give her the time of day we had to flag him down and get their attention so that they would pay attention to the people at the bar. Are food came 25 minutes later. And yep you guessed it it wasn't correct. We had asked for water didn't get it another girl came by and asked if she could remove my cup I said no I would like some water please she said all will let me just take it and I'll bring you another glass of water over 10 minutes later she brings me a glass of water. We had to ask for our bill so we could go and when we got it I walked over to the manager and let her know that I felt that the service was inadequate and she said oh you're the one that had to weigh me down she fully acknowledge that she had to be waived down to serve a customer she didn't offer to pay for our meal she just apologized to pick up our bill and Cassius out.

The waiters and waitresses took the corner booth to eat and talk. We tried for 5 minutes to capture anyone's attention to no avail. When Micheal finally stood up, his response to the fact that the steak was too rare and inedible was ""What do you want me to do about it."" Loaded question my friend. I'd have been my normal sarcastic self had my parents not been there. They cooked the steak longer but you can't get away from gristle. 
I'd say these two steaks might have been the exception however, the couple next to us had to return their chicken. I guess the cooks like everything rare!"	0.0

We had a fair size party of 6 adults 4 children.. we were celebrating graduation and mother's day.. to begin with we waited an hour to be seated, and the restaurant was empty!! Then wated 30 min to get served drinks.. i even called the manager over who helped with our drinks.. half of us got our food and the other half got cold food and our orders were not correct.   We left with half the party not eating..  the General manager did end up comping our check... but I will NEVER eat at an Applebees again!!!	0.0

Next, we ordered the spinach dip which eas one of my favorite items. Sadly, the chips were the kind you bit from the store. Salsa was soo small there was no point. I then ordered the classic burger.

Took a while to get our food order, had a horrible attitude, and very passive aggressive. After we waited over 30 mins for our food she handed out food to us purposely allowing the smoke to go in our faces. When we asked for boxes because we were upset she just said okay and walked away with out asking if anything was wrong. After waiting another 5 mins, she finally picked up the check. As she did it she snapped the book and walked away. It was also horrible seeing the way she talked to other staff members, mainly the bartender. Also hygiene was an issue.

Anyway we got our appetizer within 8 min then we got our food 10 min later. I got the new pineapple burger which was mostly just meat and bread could hardly taste anything other than that. And it was soooo small. My bf got the mushroom Swiss LUCKILY he saw a long hair strand stuck in the cheese before he took a bite! GROSSSS! We sat there 10 min before our waitress finally came back so we had to wait another 15 min so they can remake his burger that time I didn't want my burger so we just took them both to go. Took about 7-10 min to finally check out. Also I believe the manager past by us and didn't bother saying anything or ask us how we were, If I seen a couple one with food and the other without food I would of asked if they were okay but nope she just walked pass us but checking on other tables before and after us!

The food is average for a chain.  You know what you're gonna get no matter what location you go to.  The service however is hit or miss...and last night the service missed the mark by a mile!

Our waiter got to our table and asked for our drink order.  Good deal.  We order when he returns with our drinks.  
  
J's order - Fajitas. 
My order - Oriental Chicken Salad
Baby C's order - Kids Meal Grilled chicken sandwich  (Kids Eat Free on Tuesdays)

Our server, Michael,  runs off before I'm able to state..uhhh...the kids meal comes with a drink and side!!  We have to flag him down.  We state...we didn't have a chance to order the drink or side for our son.  He's like...oh i ordered him fries.  I'll have to go change it.  

REALLY!?  I'm so sorry to inconvenience you!!  And I'm glad you think you know better than I do what I wanna feed MY CHILD!  Wow!  How perceptive of you...ya dumbazz!!  I order Baby C some steamed broccoli and a juice.  

J's and my food come out as ordered.  Baby C's is MIA.  A few minutes later his sandwich is brought out....with an applesauce.  Again I have to flag down the server so the correction can be made.  About 5 minutes later we get a side of over steamed broccoli...but whatever.  Baby C doesn't seem to mind.  

Drinks...he's on the ball with refills of my water.  But misses the mark with J's root beer refill.  He brings him Dr. Pepper instead.  And then when J says...hey this is Dr. Pepper, not Root Beer.  The server is like..you ordered Dr. Pepper though, right?  WRONG!  

Then we had to wait around for the check and for him to run my card.  It was funny, but I was looking around and spotted the servers other tables.  The one right next to us didn't seem happy either with the service.  In fact they seemed pretty pissed.

Other workers seen us and didn't say anything and continued to work, still waiting as the bartender still looks at us. Another worker comes out sits at the bar and stairs at us as well? She does nothing at all and the bartender doesn't tell her to come cater to us either! At this point I'm getting heated cause this is ridiculous at this point. Bartender says something finally which the girl walks around and passes us to pick up 2 dishes and walk to the back and then come back to SIT BACK DOWN! Then another worker comes from the back sees us and then starts walking towards us but sits with a customer and has a chit chat with him! Customers behind us who walked in maybe 3-4 mins asked how long we've been waiting and we say 10 mins with no help or anyone seeming to care. There was no sign saying to seat ourselves or anything so then more people come out and say where's the hostess/host? So a lady finally comes and seats us and we are annoyed at this point. But luckily she was very sweet and nice and it made everything fine.

But I mean come on the bartender should be put on blast as well as the other workers who weren't doing anything and sitting talking to customers and the other one looking at us sitting at the bar. I wish I would have asked for a manager that day to tell him how unprofessional the night bartender was and the employees who seen us standing there and didn't do jack shit."	0.0

When I walked in, the place immediately smelled of rancid grease.  Not a good start.  Then, after ordering and taking home our breakfast, I noticed the following issues:

1. The wrappers for our burritos as well as the tortillas were soaked in grease.  I think I've seen less grease in an auto shop.
2. The eggs in the breakfast burritos were not just overcooked, they were practically charred.
3. The ham in said burritos was nearly grey.  The only color it had was a slight orange sheen from the grease.
3. The pork in the carne adovada was dry. And the red chile it ""marinated"" in was nearly room temperature.
4. The guacamole tasted and looked like it was store bought.

When I called and spoke with Eli (who claims he was the manager) he told me,  I was wrong  (stated there was no requests for no sauce), continued to say they'd send another.  1 hour of waiting again, I call to have him tell me they called me 7 times (my phone never rang) and because I didn't answer they  cancelled my order. I told him that this had been a bad experience for him to reply ""Then don't ever order from us again"". When I asked him to hang on ONE SECOND so I could grab a pen to take down Corporates #, he hung up on me..which followed by him hanging up on me 2 more times.  Later (2 hours later) I called to attempt again to get Corporates #, speaking with ""Billy"" which I believe was still Eli whom REFUSED to give me the telephone number.

Last weekend our pizzas had been out for delivery (you can check through their website the status of orders) more than 30 minutes, when the pizzas arrived, they were not in a heat saving container, the boxes were greasy and the driver did not explain or apologize for the delay (we always tip our drivers 30% or more, we are gracious customers) I called the store immediately, explained the situation, there was an uncomfortable silence which I had to then speak up and ask for compensation. My request was replied to with ""if you want your pizzas replaced it will take more than two hours....."" I stated that we didn't want to wait that long. Silence again. I asked to be refunded for my order then and asked for the name of the person I was speaking with. ""Fine we will give you your money back"" he almost hung up abruptly.

We did express our concerns to the manager and it took another 30 mins to get our food order started. From there it went down hill even more. Orders were not taken correctly food took way to long to come out a member of the party even ended getting her food after everyone else had already finished. After we expressed our concerns to the Manger the server was removed from our table. We were told our meals would be comped as we were there for 2 hours and and hour and a half of it was just waiting for food or drinks. When we asked for the bill it took another 30 mins to get all of them which our meals were definitely not comped for what so ever and not even a discount was given or even an apology for slow service. I would definitely not go back to this location if it's always gonna to be 2 hours for food and drinks and horrible wait service. If I could give this no stars I would.	1.0

Came an hour and a half early and had told the waitress/hostess we have a table of 6 coming. 3 of us were present and they continued to move us to a much smaller table and took our chairs we had saved for our on coming guests. Either the waitresses had no experience in dealing with these events or this is how typical tilted kilt establishments are ran. Words of advice, not recommended, go elsewhere!	0.0

The service was mediocre-at-best whereas the waitress was more interested in her cell phone than and taking care of us. In addition there was a young man at the bar using foul language very loudly and they had a hard time controlling or changing the atmosphere to our satisfaction. The food was average at best.

We won't be going back. The assistant manager didn't even offer a discount to take care of the issues. Upon our request he presented a very modest discount. Nothing compared to the challenges we faced in his establishment.

I don't recommend this place at all."	1.0

Appetizer of pretzels with beer cheese was VERY good!.
Then things went south...
The ice water tasted like they grabbed it out of the street gutter and had a cement taste. Couldn't even drink it.
My husband had the burger and garlic fries which he said was good. Not great but good.
I had the fish tacos and chips. The fish was broiled and had a freezer taste and was tough. There was only salsa on the fish with one lime wedge. The chips were stale so I told the server. She mentioned that the kitchen staff is new.
Sadly, if this place pays a tiny bit of attention to the quality of food, they will draw more women. The place was PACKED and I was one of 2 women in there. Those server girls were so sweet and tried so hard but their product is just not good.  I have no problem with their outfits as long as the food is edible."	3.0

We asked her what was on the happy hour menu, SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T KNOW! And said she would have to ask her manager. How do you NOT know what happy hour is? Was it because we were 2 females?

We stopped in this afternoon for lunch and to catch up with a buddy. 
He arrived 10 min before us so I was quite surprised to see he didn't have a beer in front of him, we received our drinks and still he waited. It took OVER 20 MINUTES for him to get his Miller Light, there was no apology, no suggestion for a bottle or a different beer. We just sat there, being ignored. 

It took forever for us to actually get her attention long enough to place our order as well. 
The only good thing about our experience was the spinach and artichoke dip we had as an appetizer (it was actually really good, but not good enough to bump my review from 1 star).

My buddy, who was quite depressed about the NASCAR race being delayed obviously needed another beer to drown his redneck sorrows but despite telling our server, the beer never came so he went up to the bar and asked the bartender to pour him one. After she poured it, she went and pulled the tickets of all the drinks she needed to pour. There were five tickets, clearly standing there staring at her nails was more important. 

Finally our food came but we still didn't have silverware, (despite wanting some when our appetizer arrived). Since it's a little difficult to eat a salad without a fork... I immediately asked for one (again) along with more water. Now you'd think grabbing silverware would be on the top of her priority list, nope...chatting (by chatting, I mean flirting with her obnoxious fake laugh) with another table was obviously more important. After sitting there patiently waiting for a while, my buddy got up in search of a fork. One of the other servers brought the silverware over but slammed them on the table with one hell of an attitude. At this point, I'm so over this restaurant. 

Then I bit into my chicken. It's very possible it was cooked yesterday, left under the heat lamp for a day then cut into strips when my order came back. I've had jerky that's been easier to chew!!

Finally our server came over to ask how everything was...well I still don't have my water and my bf would like more coke, but I'm not holding my breath. 

We spent the whole time waiting and waiting for our server to do her job. It was ridiculous, at one point we started timing her...8 minutes for a refill is completely unacceptable!! 

She's lucky I wasn't the one paying, there's no way she would have received the 20% tip my bf felt obligated to leave. She didn't deserve it. She was horrible, incompetent and lazy!

I have eaten at many of the ""Hooters"" type of spinoff restaurants. This was my first time at Tilted Kilt Pub & Eatery. The ambiance was okay however the service here is horrible. The servers ""Kilt Girls"" would congregate around the reception desk, and look board, instead of ""up-selling"" or even just coming by the table and ask if we are okay. I did notice smiles when our server came to our table, however when our ""Kilt Girl"" and other servers left their table, it turned into grins, and bared the look of a un-enthused employee. We had to flag down our waitress several times, she forgot things we had asked for and was incredibly slow. The entire waitstaff seemed lethargic and unenthusiastic about their product and atmosphere. The servers represent the product and should be part of the product they are creating. Places like ""Hooters"" are well trained and confident and energized about their product, along with representation, presentation and theme. The hard critique just comes from over 35 yrs in the entertainment, & service industry...which is a hard thing to sell. This brand is a nice concept and looks nice, and albeit may be okay with the regulars, however with a seasoned service veteran I can see the flaws in this model. It could use improvement  in several phases. I believe the staff could utilize a great deal of re-training with an emphasis on customers service and pride in their brand.

We had tons of waitresses pass us and a few who stopped to talk to each other by our table but no one ever asked us one question. An older couple was sat at the table next to us and were waited about 3 minutes of being seated. That's when I decided to leave. I found the manager and explained why I was upset and leaving.

Everything started out normally. I came in alone thinking I would catch the happy hour on their ""$2 Tuesday."" Business was a little slow so I was greeted and seated promptly and within 5 minutes I had spoken to two of the waitresses and placed my drink order. The young lady who took my order even commented that my selection was in line with their ""$2 Tuesday"" pricing event. I was also informed that the waitress who's section I was seated in was ""busy at the moment but would be right over.""

This is where things started to go sideways. After 20 minutes I still had not been served.
Finally, Anisha, my waitress came and introduced herself and informed me that my drink order had been submitted. (no choice of glass size was ever offered or requested - I'll get to this later)

Five minutes later my first drink arrived. Time passes and after finishing my first drink the glass sat on the table, empty, for a good 15 minutes as my server walked past several times before I was asked if I wanted another. This was to be a reoccurring theme during my stay. I ordered another drink and some food. Food quality and turn-around time was good but the wait time for drinks was still unacceptable.

I ordered one more drink and asked for my ticket to be closed out. Upon receiving my bill I noticed that I had been charged FULL PRICE for my drinks. When I brought this to my server's attention, I was informed that the $2 Tuesday price was for a ""regular"" size glass and that I was being served in the 20oz glass. Remember the ""no choice of size offered"" statement above?
  
I paid the tab but that little (intentional) omission of the size of the glass, was paid for with (what would have been) the young girl's tip.

But what was really upsetting was seeing my bank account this morning showing a debit higher than the actual  total. I reviewed my receipt again to make sure I didn't add incorrectly, and I hadn't. 

The total was $15.40 and I left a $2.60 tip, for an even total of $18. The amount charged to my account was $19.25. I won't cry over $1.25, but I thought to share this to caution others who also pay with debit cards and spend a lot more $$$ at this Tilted Kilt.

I can't make my kid eat that. I sent it back for a kids hamburger, specifically no cheese and 45 minutes later we got a cheeseburger. My 7 year olds food took AN HOUR AND 45 MINUTES after we  arrived.  Her Lemonade took 1 hour after 3 requests for her drink.   I asked the server if the kids meal came with a drink or any sides, she said yeah, like brocolli or fries.  So I ordered fries.  Then I was charged for a side basket of fries along with the 2 kids meals of mac n gross cheese soup and the messed up burger.....as she dropped the check and said she removed the mac n cheese.  Ha.  Also asked if they had bangers and mash and she shook her head no and acted as she had no idea what that was.  This is a Irish pub and they don't serve sausage and potatoes. I wont even get into how many times my friends at another table checks were wrong or how many messed up items they had.  We waited for our second round of drinks for 25 minutes.  Discouraged we asked our friends at another table and they had the same lame service.  They were also given our round of drinks (the huge and complicated 2 drinks we ordered AGAIN) and sent them back unknowing they were ours and they weren't theirs.  Hot mess.  We also saw sides on their burger entree(tater tots) that was never offered to us.  It was Horrible! Under staffed and under experienced waitress.  Won't be back.  Sorry TK.  I'm pretty easy going but this service ruined our evening.  I can't actually spend money here after an experience like that.	2.0

We ordered beers and a menu.
The bartender brought us our drinks and said she would be right back with our menus....which were literally directly behind her....all she had to do was reach behind her and grab our menus.
Instead, she went to the end of the bar to our right, made 2 drinks and fetched 2 beers for a waitress, got new drinks for 2 or 3 other customers, and tabbed out a couple of folks.
I walked down to the end of the bar and asked her AGAIN for menus...she said, ""I'll be right there"".
She walked RIGHT PAST US and the menus TWICE without reaching her hand out to grab one for us.
She even waited on 2 customers on the left of us....AGAIN walking past the menus....before she FINALLY stopped, directly in front of us, back to us, and grabbed 2 menus.
We had been there 10 minutes and would have already known what we wanted and could have, at this point, placed our order.
She was clearly being obstinate and showing us that she'll get our menus when SHE wants to...not when WE wanted them.
when she brought our menus....FINALLY!!!....I told her to just tab me out.
I paid...no tip...and we went elsewhere for our meal.
Whoever at this restaurant reads this review, you need to seriously take a look at your bartenders, at least one of whom is pushing business away from your restaurant.
Completely not the point of any business.
This is why I was very specific as to when we were there....so the manager can know who was working the bar at the time.
I do not know her name but she is very in love with herself, has longish dark hair, and is very proud of her tattoos...one of which is a large flower at the top of her thigh or perhaps on her hip. Very visible however..
Horrible waitress. Horrible face of the Tilted Kilt.

We got there on a Saturday night and despite not being too busy it took them about 15 minutes to seat us. Once seated we were greeted by the ""Newcastle girls"" who promptly got the guys beers. After another 20 minutes we met our waitress who took our drink order. She forgot the my drink and I finally got it after 45 minutes in the restaurant. About an hour into being there and seeing our waitress twice, we asked the Newcastle girls to please get her so that we could order. She came back very irritated and tried to leave THREE times while we were ordering. I felt like we needed to hold onto her to keep her at the table to take our order. The food was sub par at best and very hard to enjoy with a table full of empty plates and cups that were never cleaned up. The waitress also told us they did not have malt vinegar to go with the fish and chips. We got another waitress who found some and gave it to us. Two hours after arriving the waitress told us she was done and closed us out. We saw her an hour later serving other tables.

I came tonight and it was the complete opposite.  I had suggested this to my brother ans multiple friends who I haven't seen for months.  Our food wasn't served at the same time and my boyfriends nachos served cold.  We then bought drinks which we were not told is not on the menu and the ingredients charged seperately... and charged $12 per drink ($6 for a fireball shot inside of my angry orchard) (that same shot is in another specialty drunk with ice cream for $8.00 total).  Charged full price for the shot and full price for the beer.  It was not explained to us this was the case.  We did not check if it was on the menu we just knew what we wanted.  The absolute worst part of our service was the manager Brent. As I work in the staffing industry I have to say it's upsetting there are so many beter customer service driven individuals who could have done his job better than him in their sleep. It's upsetting someone like this makes a good wage while others are over looked.  As we explained to him how upsetting it was that I didn't get to have a meal with my family all at the same time and how the drinks were served at a completely unfair price without any explination as to why he just repeated ""I apologize for that"". He then told us we should have sent our food back and told them not to make new food if we wanted it adjusted off of our bill....  (we came there to eat.. so we were all hungry and expecting food; hot and at the same time..) he apologized in such a fake uncaring way I couldn't believe it.  We were given free appetizer cards for ""the next time we come""  (durring happy hour) as if this service would bring in future customers.  We were then told they close at 12 every Friday even though the door states two ""The door wouldnt state 2... we never stay open that late"".... funny... I have a picture of the doors tonight... they close at ""2"" on fridays.  The waitress later told us that they close early everynight because no one is there.... hmmm... wonder why.   This guy's doesn't seem to know anything about customer service or management and because of him I (nor my family)  will never come to this location again.

As we arrived we notified the hostess that it was the birthday of 2 of the guys in our group & he stated he would check & see if they did anything for birthdays? Never got back to us. We were seated and waited about 10 minutes before a server came around and took our drink order .. we ordered 2 bottled beers and the rest were soft drinks, about 10 minutes went by and the server brought out the beer, 5 more minutes and she slowly brought us each our drink. We notified the server we were about ready to order and she stated she will ""be right back"" about 30 minutes went by and still no presence of our server! At this point we were ready to leave but we decided to give them a little longer .. BIG MISTAKE. It was to the point where we had to walk up to the hostess and ask if someone can take our order! Someone else (not our server) finally came around and took our order. Food came around 2 of the burgers were brought out incorrectly, the wings I got were way over cooked, big deal.. we ate our food and had to ask for the bills to be brought out. At this point we had been in the restaurant for about 2 hours, Friday night and the restaurant was nearly empty.. I could not find a reason as to why the service was so slow. My friends and I have all been/are in the restaurant business, one had been a server for a few years, the other is the manager for a restaurant and my family and I own a restaurant, we all understand what it's like to be swamped and be behind.. not the case here at all. We decided not to leave a tip as no one even bothered to come around fill our drinks, take our order, check on our table (at least once). MOST OUTRAGES PART OF THE NIGHT we were walking out to our cars and one of the servers has the nerve to come out and ask for their tip! ARE YOU KIDDING!? What kind of person thinks it's OK in anyway to run out after a costumer and demand more money when they provide a sh*t service! Worst service we have ever seen, very disappointed.

No TV at home, for sporting events, Tilted Kilt was the place to go. Was. No more. Went there as a family, wife, 2 kids. The game is on big screen. Great, exactly what we wanted. So let's order food, and let the kids discover the atmosphere of a game. Loud noise, atmosphere, excitement... Instead of that, management (if it can be called that) declined any sound related to the event. So, help me understand... you are showing something on a big screen, but no sound? The answer from management: there is a baseball game coming up, and we are expecting people. Look around, there is 20 people in the whole bar (sad), 15 are watching the game with no sound. We asked, he declined. No one is here for baseball. Obvious. It makes me wonder, where does Tilted Kilt get people to manage businesses? From Airport Security? Or the poorer intellectually and customer service wise you are, the more you have a chance to manage our multi million dollar facility? In short, that was the very last time I ever stepped foot in a Tilted Kilt, the poverty in management customer service made me forget about the kindness of our server, poor cute thing in the middle. Managing is also leading by example, the example shown by management is that you don't care. So i don't care about your business either. There are plenty other places where I can spend my money.

My niece ordered BBQ sauce instead of ranch and mandarin oranges instead of fries and when the food came out she got ranch and fries, when the check came we got charged for the waitress' mistake.  I ordered chicken wings with blue cheese and guess what i received ranch dressing, on the ticket i was charged for that also.   I was also kind of surprised that for the price of wings you only get 8.  The parking sucked on top of all this.

We were seated promptly as the restaurant was almost empty.  It took  our ""server"" 10 minutes to come to our table and ask for our drink order.  Once the order was taken, it took about 10-15 minutes to get the drink.  More time passes and we were finally able to get the server to take our food order.  She has the personality of a paper bag and I'm sure that if she smiled her face would probably crack.  Nice makeup, though.  Once the food was ordered we waited, two of us each ordering a burger, for 20-30 minutes for the food to arrive.  Maybe once or twice the server came walking past our table to ask ""how is everything tasting"", but not convincingly.  No apology for the lateness of the food.  She made us feel as though she were doing us a favor by serving us at all.  The manager of this place needs to read Yelp more often, because I am a staunch believer that everything that is wrong in a restaurant is ultimately the fault of the manager.  If you want a better staff, and you REALLY, REALLY need one, then you need to demand much more of them.  If you don't stand behind good service, neither will your staff.  It's that simple.  Other tables' waitresses seemed to much more pleasant and attentive, but ours did not even ask me if I wanted another beer!  Loss of revenue, Mr. or Ms. manager.

We have not gotten out of there in under 2 hours yet!! The average is 33 minutes from the time out food is given to the kitchen before it comes to us. Each time the orders are wrong. Drink service is slow and the place is so loud you can't even hear people at your table and that is at lunch time!! The music is ridiculously loud. The managers have offered us 50% discount each time to apologize. What happened to the way things were ran at the old place? It has to be the many of the same staff and kitchen team that works there. We see the many familiar faces. The serving staff tries but the have zero support. Every time we are there, everyone around us at other tables all have issues and the manager visits nearly every table to put out the fires.

We were trying to explain what had happened and he cut us off and said do you want to speak to someone. And then just transferred our call. Disgusting!

We said we wanted to watch three games, the cardinals, Vikings, and redskins games. They wouldn't change one tv to the Cardinals game. Even though we are in ARIZONA. And the only ones in the restaurant. Also they had other games on multiple tvs but the redskins and Vikings were each only on one TV. We have been to many natives before and we love coming to them, they have always changed the tvs to accommodate us, gave us great service so coming to this one was a shock. Terrible service.

We usually come here multiple times a month for wings but not this particular location due to all other times experience to be horrible. Well tonight was no exception. First off, it was extremely loud and when I  asked our server if he could turn down the game I was told he would see. 30 minutes go by he says nothing and the volume is the same if anything it's actually LOUDER than when I asked. We ordered 24 wings and were told they no longer do that because they changed their increments to orders of 5. Fair enough we'll take 25. Our order comes out with 20 wings. The poor bartender had to check in with us because our server is MIA at this point. I inform her about the volume situation and she informs me that the man I spoke to was the manager and if he said he would check then there was nothing she could do. She was super sweet and kind about it though, although the man I spoke to wasn't the manager at all he was a waiter and the manager was in red. I didn't get a chance to speak to him but needless to say, my family and I now remember why this location doesn't get our business!!!	0.0

The table was grimy to start out with which grossed us out. Our food took thirty minutes to come out, and people who had arrived after us had already gotten their food.  Then, my dad's lemon and pepper hand rubbed wings were dried out, had only five blades and one little drumstick and were super super salty.  We were in a hurry since our food took so long, so he was just going to go ahead and eat them, even though he didn't really like them. 

Austin came by and offered to switch out the last two, which my dad appreciated.  He then came back a couple minutes later and said he wasn't allowed to switch them out, and BROUGHT THE OLD WINGS BACK! 

We then asked for the manager.  This manager, NATE, came and had the WORST customer service I've experienced in a long time.  He was not polite, and he told my dad why he wasn't switching out the two measly legs.  How rude and how ridiculous.  It's sad that he lost probably a whole network of people's business, and gave us a poor impression of his leadership skills over a couple hot wings.  

I'm a leadership consultant, and I would recommend hiring new management to the owner. We commend Austin for trying to do good customer service in an environment where his leadership (from our experience) does not seem to care about the customer.  My family and I don't ever want to eat at Native again due to this unpleasant experience that kept me up that night thinking about how disappointing and frustrating it was."	1.0

Here's my experience from my recent visit on the Mayweather's fight past week.

- When we walked in, after telling the host how many, he just handed the menu to us and told us to sit wherever instead of walking us to a table. This is the worst you can do to a customer. Hand them a menu and tell them to go sit down. Are you too lazy to walk them to a table?

- Place was disgusting. Beer all over the floor and sticky seats and tables. 

- Like most people complained here, this facility seems like a depressing hotel from the 90's. No ambience, not hip at all. Also has a weird smell.

- WINGS = EXTRA SMALL compare to any other NN location. 

- Rude waiters, specially the guys that work here. No smile, Not friendly. 

- Our chicken strips came out burnt. Returned the order. No manager came out to talk to us.

Then all 3 of the most recent visits the orders have been wrong or they forgot items we ordered. Today they forgot a salad and the buffalo potato chips were made with tortilla chips...eww. My co workers got chicken strippers and there are 3 very small pieces of chicken. The other 2 times they forgot salads, dressings, etc.  For as pricey as it is, that's ridiculous. The last time they screwed up an order we called and the guy laughed and said I guess you can come back and pick it up. So needless to say, we aren't going to call and complain this time, we just aren't going to come back.

3391	z0NImASe6DNDREiIt8NF-Q	1.0	0.0	1.0	Terrible all around. I love native New Yorker. I figured they were all the same. Boy was I wrong. We came to watch the World Cup and eat some wings/drink a few drinks. After arriving we were not super hungry yet, and with it being 110 degrees outside all we wanted was water. We sat down ordered a couple waters for the time being and planned to order food/drinks after cooling down a bit.  Instantly the waitress asked for both ID's (which I could understand since we were in the bar area) and then immediately said she needed a debit card. I asked why, considering we had only ordered water, and her reply was that she needed it cause people run out on their tab consistently and that they were understaffed so they wouldn't be able to watch us well. The main problem I had with this is that we hadn't even ordered anything yet! It made us feel very alienated and like criminals for just sitting down. I have never been treated this way in a restaurant. Needless to say I will never return to this location. Management needs to understand this is not how you treat customers. The location I usually go to we typically spend around $100 between 3 or 4 ppl during World Cup games and we always make it a point to overtip the wait staff. I ordered one beer here and that's it. I probably would have ordered more but the waitress seemed to be ignoring us probably for the fact that we originally ordered just water and she assumed we weren't going to order anything else. Again, I love Native New Yorker, but this place needs to get there stuff together. Hire more staff rather than making customers feel like criminals!	4.0

She didn't return 20 minutes later, not even 30 minutes later. 40 minutes passed and I finally flagged down a bus boy to grab her. The food took another 30 minutes and arrived cold, and several of us never got one drink refill the entire time.

On par with other NNY locations. Not great, but not bad. Although, my 7yo made a point to compliment the server on how much she liked the pretzel rolls on her sliders.

SERVICE
Friendly, but PAINFULLY slow. We sat for about 15 minutes before anybody greeted us or took our drink order. I felt abandoned many times. I had to sit there and stare at my salad (once I finally got it) for a while before they brought silverware. It took about 20 minutes between the time I said we were done and the time I got the bill, after reminding her once in-between. What should have been a 1 hour visit, easily turned into 2.

DECOR
In a word: depressing. I felt like I was sitting in my great grandmother's barn. It's just one, big, drab, loud, bright, dingy room. There were a couple pictures of New York on the wall, and some TVs. Otherwise, we might as well have been sitting in an elementary school cafeteria.

I will probably never go again -- not with the number of other great choices in the area."	1.0

Not to drink , but isn't that the point of going into the bar is to be away from kids?  There are over 7 family's here now with their kids age ranging from 3 months to 12. This is so not acceptable. I vow to make sure this gets changed !	1.0
3409	z0NImASe6DNDREiIt8NF-Q	1.0	1.0	1.0	We have been frequenting this Native New Yorker for years and we have never been so disrespected as we were today. We sat down with our family which included a 10 year old on the bar area at 3:15 on a Sunday. The server came up to us and let us know that kids had to sit in the dining room.  We let her know that there was another kid in the bar. She told us it was the bartenders son. It was not the bartenders shift. He was there sitting as a patron with friends.  We are not the type to complain or leave a restaurant, but we are done with Native New Yorker for now. We understand rules, but they should apply to everyone. Even the bartenders and all employees. You can contact me at emily.liscom@gmail.com if you need any more info about this situation.	5.0

Right off the bat you can tell this is not a new Native or a very nice one but we wanted to eat. First noticeable thing was the smell. I am actually not sure how to explain it but it sort of smelled like cat urine when you walked in the front door. The entrance is not very welcoming at all, and sort of leads you down a hallway where they seat you. We were seated at a stand alone table, preffered a booth but you can't always get what you want. It was just a wide open room with tables, a bunch of TV's. Waitress came out and took order. It became obvious this was not a traditional Native Ny'er but was previously called something else and was in the process of being changed over. I think they were struggling with an identity crisis as this place is simply not up to par with most natives we have been too ( like the one on Gilbert and Germann) and even the one in Dobson Ranch is nicer than this one. We ordered wings for the kids and us adults all got fish n chips. wings came out and could not believe how small they were. I will call them micro wings. Service was slow. The Fish and Chips actually took 20 or 25 minutes. I expressed a bit of concern with the server on how long food was taking. It was finally delivered. Fries were a little soggy but fish good. They took a whopping 10% off the order for the delay. 

This location has a long way to go before I will eat here again.. With so many other Natives and sports bars close by no reason to come to this one."	1.0
3412	z0NImASe6DNDREiIt8NF-Q	0.0	0.0	2.0	"Yeah, it's just average food compared to what's around Gilbert. Tastes like I heated up some stuff from the freezer section at Sam's Club. Fun bar food, just very average. There were lots of newly trained, very young servers the night we went, service was slow and it was hard to get drink refills. It would be cool if Native gave their kitchen more rope to create something unique but this is definitely an old school corporate restaurant.

We ordered Buffalo Nachos but there was not a lot of food on the plate."	1.0

3415	z0NImASe6DNDREiIt8NF-Q	0.0	0.0	2.0	This location is pretty crappy. There's a hotel that shares the parking lot so sometimes you won't have parking during dinnertime. It was just a group of 2, a friend and I at around 8:30, I realize it's a bar but it was way to loud. We were also sitting in the resturant area and not the bar area. There was 2 group of people watching basketball and causing a riot. I'm assuming they were drunks. The food was good, but the service was kind of crappy too. They didn't really pay attention to us and it took a while to flag someone down to get their attention. Definitely will not be returning.	2.0
3416	z0NImASe6DNDREiIt8NF-Q	0.0	0.0	2.0	Disappointing. I used to come here as a kid twenty-five years ago and the food is no where what it used to be. They need Bar Rescue to save this place and bring it back to what it used to be. Do not get the Flatbread pizza. It is dripping with grease and the sauce might as well have a gallon of vinegar in it. The mozerella sticks look like they've been purchased from the grocery store and frozen multiple times. The wings are okay, but nothing like they used to be. Oh and they really need to being the cheese and crackers back.	0.0

I get that this is a restaurant in an airport terminal so there's a constant flow of customers and maybe because of this they don't care to focus on customer service... I'm just hoping my server, Sunni, was having an off night. I am catching a red eye and I am sleepy and I am hungry and my flight is delayed. She never came back and then never came back and then I didn't get to eat anything. This is a hard one not to recommend because the only alternative is a closing magazine stand.

Sunni! I get you are busy and hey I have had jobs I have hated too (I heard you and the server behind me talking while I tried to get your attention).

I got the shrimp tacos. I didn't care for the tortillas nor the rice. The shrimp was alright, they just grilled it no seasoning at all. And the guacamole looked very unappealing.

I ordered the chimichanga. It sucked. Tasted like a really awful egg roll. The rice tasted like invisible flavor nothingness. Beans were slosh. Service was sh*t. I was so irritated after waiting 88 hours just to flag down my server.

It was served on a disposable plate with plastic utensils. Tiny spot of beans were cold and obviously canned. Rice was cold and flavorless, like Uncle Ben's. Tacos were in thin and hardening flour tortillas with a sliver of fried fish, some slaw and absolutely drenched in the most dreadful mayonnaise based sauce (mostly like thousand island burger sauce). Disgusting. No time to complain (my flight was  boarding), but I actually felt sorry for the server that this is his job. Lots of people drinking, they should stick to that and not pretend to be a restaurant. I should have eaten at Wendy's - at least I know what to expect from them.	0.0

Id rather have ordered Wendy's breakfast over this. Big mistake! I'm not sure that the carne asada steak is even real meat and I was served old and cold potatoes not to mention the generic batch of scrambled eggs is your only option. My server did bring me some fresh potatoes which was pretty much my breakfast. No complaints with my server though. She was very pleasant and even gave me 10% off which was appreciated. If you're hungry in the morning hours waiting for your flight, I suggest you find somewhere else to eat.	2.0

I ordered the shredded chicken tacos and asked for salsa verde. The tacos were lukewarm and bland and arrived with the standard red salsa in a little plastic cup with a lid on it, along with a set of plastic flatware, some black beans, and rice. The beans tasted like plain black beans out of a can. The rice was plain white rice. They desperately needed some flavor, so I tried the red salsa; all heat and no flavor, not good. I waited for the server to return and check on me so that I could get the green salsa I ordered.

And waited. And waited. And waited. She walked by twice to deal with other tables and I tried to catch her eye; no luck. I put down the utensils and sat there and stared at her: nothing. Waved. ""Excuse me..."" Nothing. 

Finally I gave up and marched up to the bar, where she was standing there chatting with the bartender, and asked if I could please get the salsa verde. 

A few minutes later she drops by my table and sets a little plastic cup of salsa verde on my plate. It's half full. There's no lid. Salsa is dripping over the edge. There are bits of green onion and queso blanco stuck to the sides. It's fairly obvious that she plucked it off the plate of some other diner who had finished their meal.

Now, on to the cons:

I've eaten a lot of airport food in my time and I know not to have very high expectations. However, this place was just downright gross. Service was incredibly slow, our waitress seemed highly overwhelmed and it was difficult to order or get our check.

We ordered 2 cocktails, guacamole, chicken tacos, and a caesar salad. Our disappointing meal came out to about $70....seriously. The drinks were overly sugary and I have a sneaking suspicion they were missing the alcohol. The guac was ok, but served piled on a tray of chips and topped with an overwhelming amount of sweet pickled onions. The chicken on both the salad and the tacos was exactly the same, some sort of rubbery meat that tasted fake and seemed like it had been pre-cooked and then microwaved. The tacos were served on undercooked tortillas and topped with about half a cup of sour cream. The salad was made up of sad wilted romaine and came with a very underwhelming dressing.

Coffee tasted like yesterday, nothing healthy and the eggs are all powdered scrambled.  Stay away.  Issue is, Delta gates 15-26 are serviced by this one sit down restaurant.  There is nothing else.  I will fly American now when traveling in and out of PHX;  cannot believe Delta allows this type of food service offerings in their boarding gate wing.	0.0

Decor/cleanliness: 3
Nothing to really comment on here.  Nothing bad or anything really remarkable.

Food: 1
Wow!  Where I do I even begin?!  I ordered the shrimp, chicken, and steak fajitas and everything about this dish was lacking.  The steak was rubbery and tasteless.  But for a twist, the chicken and steak weren't tasteless at all... They were incredibly salty instead (what a great trade off!) !
The guacamole was just downright disgraceful.  It didn't even look like guacamole, just some watered-down, green paste!  The rice seemed to be of extremely low quality and was just as low in the taste department!  The tortillas were pretty awful as well.  This is definitely one of the worst fajitas meals that I have ever had the displeasure of trying to eat!  I spent a good portion of my plane ride hoping not to get sick!

Service: 2
So, let me get this straight... You serve subpar food and then have the nerve to charge an arm and a leg for the privilege of trying to keep it down?!  The prices are ridiculous; even for airport food!  The one saving grace was that our waitress was nice and she checked up on us in a timely fashion.

First off, my waiter was visibly annoyed when I did not immediately order food. He even came back and took my menu away even though I had said I was going to order food later. I had gotten a drink,  so I was still a customer and the pave was hardly packed.

When my drink was finished,  he totally ignored me and his colleague had to check in with me.  Then he gave her the wrong drink order. 

I then started looking at the menu. When I closed it, even though he saw me,  he did not come to take my order.  As I prepared to flag him down,  same colleague had to come and save his butt. I ordered my burrito to go because I was so over it and I needed to charge my phone. 

Food comes out on a plate.  When I say something to my waiter he doesn't even respond to me just goes straight to the woman covering his table and goes ""did she really order that to go?""  Yes,  I could hear him.  Rude.

So I pay,  finish my beer,  and go to put the burrito in the box. No tin foil, no apology for not getting it right. 

The table was super narrow and he put the box on the very edge.  Now in a hurry, I don't even look before putting the burrito in the box and it immediately falls to the floor.

When I asked what they could do,  the answer was essentially to eat it off the floor.

There were a few patrons here and there, so I can't speak about crowds, but I was craving breakfast and got the Huevos with bacon and potatoes, and it was served with a couple of flour tortillas on the side instead of bread. Huevos is spanish for eggs just so you all know. 

The meal was adequate. It wasn't horrible. But it wasn't too good either. The best part of the meal was the eggs, which were fluffy and buttery. They were delicious. Everything else was horrible. The bacon barely tasted like bacon. It was more like crispy salt sticks. The potatoes, which are hard to screw up, in fact were tasteless as well as soggy and mushy, and the tortilla, well it was hard, dry, and stale. In fact, that four tortilla was the most disgusting tortilla I had ever eaten in the 10 years I lived in AZ, and I had been around college kids who had no inkling on how to cook who knew how to properly heat up a tortilla.

However I must say that the customer service was great, and the food arrived in a timely fashion.

Decided to have a few pre-flight drinks before take off around 8:30am. Wasn't busy by any means and there were three servers along with the bartender to cover.  Once seated we were greeted promptly but after that pretty much on our own.  

Ordered a Bloody Mary which was ok. Seemed more tomato juice than actual mix or alcohol.  Almost V8 like. At least I got my nutrients I guess ( high five ).   Then waited 20 minutes for another drink. After the waitress would not come around we just ordered from the bartender two margaritas.  These were even worse. Tasted of dirty sink water and expired margarita mix. Couldn't taste and tequila.  Pretty much forced it down out of principle since it was 10 freaking dollars.  

Safe to say on my next early flight I'll just stick with coffee from Starbucks."	3.0

My server, Consuelo, provided that magical combination of surly attitude and horribly slow service. The woman who was seated after me, was DONE eating before my nachos were served to me...cold...by another server as my server waited for drinks at the bar while my food sat in the window. This was only after I flagged down the other server, of course. Consuelo did not check on me one single time after my food was delivered. I used to be a waitress so I am a generous tipper and almost never leave anything below 20%. Consuelo, however, was lucky to get a dollar & some change on my $25 tab...and that was generous.

Si, I did pay $13 for the worst nachos of my life. The chicken was cold, rubbery and inedible. I munched on a handful of chips with cold cheese sauce and queso fresca before giving up entirely.

I thought he was joking at first but he as serious. So my niece asked what our options are and he was rude. Seriously?! The only reason I gave 2 stars instead of one was because our server Jennifer was not bad.

Later as I was finishing the coffee, I got a mouthful of grounds in my mouth. I said something about the coffee to the same woman who was now unloading the boxes in the food pickup area and she wouldn't even acknowledge that I was speaking to her even though she was standing right next to me on the client side of the counter.

What got under my skin was the 25 minute wait for a simple hamburger and fries. There were only 5 people in the dining area! When I finally received  my food I found that my burger was undercooked after delving a couple bites in and my fries were soggy. What the hell were they doing behind the counter for almost half an hour? It certainly wasn't cooking my food. Others around me found their food in similar conditions today. The staff must be asleep at the grill. At the end of the experience I didn't have time to wait for them to cook another because I had to catch my flight and they refused to refund my money at the counter. I was referred to call and number. I'm sure I won't  be refunded in the long run. My time is more precious than the 14 dollars I lost today.	0.0

I got the classic burger($11.50) and chocolate shake ($6.50). Like every other restaurant at the airport prices were almost double of what you would pay outside. After ordering it was almost a 15 minutes wait to finally get the food.

The burger itself was pretty big but not huge, with a lot of stuff thrown in between the buns. I could comfortably lift it and bit into it without making a big mess. There were two problems with the burger. First the patties were overcooked so were dry as a bone. Secondly the burger was over-seasoned. It had so much salt that I could not taste anything else on the bun, just the taste of salt in every bit. After a couple of bites I could not bear this torture anymore so I gave up and trashed it. The chocolate shake on the other hand was very pleasant. It was not too sweet yet sweet enough to satisfy my sweet tooth. I would have personally liked the milkshake to be a lot thicker but this was easier to put down.

He advised our pizzas would be delivered in 20-30 minutes. 45 minutes later I called to check on our pizzas as they hadn't arrived. Adam sounded confused and asked me to hold.

I asked if they had used the room number we left initially. She declined to answer any of my questions and attempted to over talk me. After she saw that I wouldn't be over talked, especially since I had already paid for a pizza that was NEVER delivered to me, she hung up on me. I called the front desk of this VERY NICE RESORT and was advised that there was no pizza left at the front desk. I immediately called back, Adam answered again. I asked to speak to his manager. He knew EXACTLY who I was when he called Maddie to the phone. I told her I was on my way and to have my pizzas ready. I arrived within 10 minutes to be greeted by Haley who says it was her rude ass over the phone and that she didn't lie.

Deceptive Trade Practice - Domino's Pizza
I recently received this coupon (coupon #4335) in the mail for 2 Medium 2-Topping Pizzas & a 16-Piece Order of Parmesan Bread Bites for $14.95. I placed my order from this location: Domino's Pizza, 3329 Bell Road, Phoenix, AZ 85032, 602-482-3030. I spoke with Brian first, then he put me on hold and Peter (both no last names) picked up the phone. 

The conversation went as follows:
Peter - quoted me $18.95, he said my coupon expired.
Myself - The coupon is a recent mail offer with an expiration date of April 13, 2014
Peter - Corporate issued the coupon but did not update their system and he cannot honor nor adjust the coupon offer.  The problem is with the company headquarters regarding a false disclaimer. 
Myself - The coupon offer would affect a large number of people who received this offer and would hold domino's accountable to honor their coupon in ""good faith.""
Peter - We sell a lot of pizza's it want hurt us. You're welcome to notify Corporate Headquarters about the coupon. Phone disconnects.

I was a loyal customer until a recent strings of events: bad customer service (excessive hold time), wrong order (not what ordered), and uninspiring food (greasy, pop-up bubbles and less meat). The food was replaced with fresh ingredients and preparations. With this new-enlightened not to operate in ""good faith"" or excellence was the final decision to discontinued doing business with Domino's Pizza."	0.0

When I called they told me the app wasn't accurate. I pointed out it didn't automatically advance the QA. They said well it's not out fault.

After asking the manager for help on the bill, he rudely snatched the bill and said "" we're not taking off the whole thing"" and walked away as if the steak didn't look rare. When he came back with the rearranged balance, he asked if I was done eating while grabbing the plate at the same time I was taking the last few bites of the hash browns I could take before he grabbed the plate.

I go to pick it up, I admit I was not happy of what my order looked like. It looked nothing like the pics I saw on line, not even close. The problem this one rude ass, smart ass little staffer who I had one bad experience before. She brings me my order, I was not happy , ready to leave without taking or paying for my order and as I was ready to walk out the door, this little girl says loud enough for me to hear with my back turned with such malice, rudeness and hate in her voice "" Hmmm you are never happy anyway every time you come here anyway hhmm "". I turned around in shock and honestly could not believe my ears. I was already walking away and she started to fight with me. I said ""Excuse me , I would like to speak with a manager please "". She got some chubby looking I tried to explain why I was upset ( for what she said to me as I was again already walking away. ) Bottom line as the end, she lied through her teeth about me and had the nerve to bring in my husband , who was not even with me at the time, in to the conversation. WTF !!!! She said again with a attitude "" You are always upset, that is why your husband came to pick it up the last time "". Are you kidding me !!!!!! Manager did NOTHING ! He allowed her to disrespect me like this. He DID NOTHING . He did not take ownership for this girl's unprofessional attitude and just plain rudeness. This girl clearly does not know what Customer Service is. I reached out to Chilli's Corp office, finally got a call today from some dude in Texas , I got no where with him,. This fool already made up his mind that he took the worker's side !! WTF !!! He all but stated he would not take any action against the worker or manager. It's me who is the problem not the worker. Chilli's You lost a valued , loyal customer forever . I BANNED YOU. I WILL NEVER , EVER GO TO ANTHER'S CHILI'S EVER AGAIN. You allow the staff there to treat customers like #hit and get away with it. YOU SUCK . Management needs to take ownership of the mistreatment of customers like myself. Like I said I was already walking away when this clearly unhappy, ugly girl said what she said to me behind my back & then she brings my husband in to the conversation, he was not even with me. I expected and wanted a apology from her, the manager at this Chili's ( 75th Ave & Encanto in Phx, AZ ) refused to have her do it. He needs to man up and take ownership. People be aware ...Just saying . Chili's Management DOES NOT CARE ABOUT THEIR CUSTOMERS at all who pay good money to eat and drink at Chili's. I left there and went straight across to Olive Garden who treated me like family, they hooked us up. They know how to treat people. I should have known better . #Chilisneedstodoalotbetter #customersfirst"	0.0

There is absolutely no reason for someone to wait over ten minutes to get their drinks ordered, then another ten to actually get them. A hostess should be more focused on seating people then cleaning off a table that is not needed at that point and time. I seriously saw her stare at the people walk in and they stood there and waited. She continued to clean off the table that no one sat at after. CUSTOMERS come first. Our server also waited on tables 3 times for instance checking on them and filling their drinks while we sat there. One rule anyone in this industry knows is to make sure every customer has a drink on their table first. This makes customers happy! Not sitting there being ignored and get some lame excuse that someone called out, I don't care you own the fact that you ignored us for 15 minutes! Food was average. Terrible timing with drinks from the bar. My food was delivered to another table they picked it up after putting it there and then gave it to me, that is not okay!	0.0

We get there and the guy (1st host) tells me about 15min he guess (his exact words), we have problems clearing off table ?  OK we can wait , my party of 5 set down to wait & as I look around,  he was right . I see about 5 tables  (1 large table) just waiting to get cleaned off so I watch how they will handle it ?? Will after 20 min all works and both host walks by them doing nothing,  25 min in to it I asked to talk to Mgr on duty ( Jay ) and the host ( the girl who always does nothing when we go there) calls him and tells me he will be right up ?? 5min go's by and no Mgr & finely the lgr table gets pull apart making 1 table for 4 and 1 for 6 & cleans off the smaller table and then  comes up at witch a party of 3 walks in and they seat them ( remember my 5 & other party of 4 are still waiting ) get a little up set now. Will few min later they clean off the big table they pulled apart and seats us ( still no mgr) we get drinks, appatizer, and dinner. The server at first started off slow but he took care of us and did a great job ($40 tip) about 2 & half hrs go's by (still no mgr but I do see him walking around) i pay bill ( $210 plus tip) and I stop at the host station  (no one to be found ) I ask a  waitress for the mgr (5min go's by) & guess who shows up finally (Jay) I asked why he never came over and gives me a line of crap he didn't know and stands there like he don't care so I leave. Never once did he care .. This kind of management will kill the location business fast ( this location been open now about 6mo ) I eat at all different  Chili's location on average 15 times a month if not more and by far this location management suck !!! So sad and time to wake up and hire a busboy or 2 to fix it OR tell your host to stop standing around joking with each other and clean the table off the second they open up !!!

You'd think as a manager you'd want to make sure people eating at your restaurant get great customer service... (not the case here).

First, we ordered and everything was okay. Until we got our drinks the margaritas were watered down and the strawberry lemonade tasted like there was more seeds from the strawberries than fruit. Then it took forever to get refills on our drinks, the fried pickles we got were full of grease, and the guacamole that came with the chips and salsa was brown and they tried to argue that it was fresh. Then when our food finally came after a very long wait my Ma's fajitas weren't even sizzling, the vegetables weren't cooked and the chicken and steak were barely lukewarm. My wife's ribs were okay but again lukewarm, she barely had a any rice on her plate, and then my steak I asked for medium rare and it was cooked great but then I go to eat it and there's cheese on it but nasty looking cheese. I peal it off and it comes off like it's skin. Was horrible. So, they make me another one which by the time it comes out I have finished my fries and 30 min has passed. This time it was well but I wasn't about to say anything I just ate it at least it didn't have ""skin"" cheese on it and was hot. We then ordered our dessert on the tables tablet thing and the waitress comes 15min after we ordered it asking if we were ready to order our dessert. We tell her we already have and she says that we weren't suppose to do that cause it messes up the check. Well, then she should have made it a point to come back instead of continuing to forget about us. And the whole time my wife and several other tables asked for the hockey game to be changed to one of the football games and it took them 50 min to finally get out there to change it as we were leaving. And as we were leaving the Manager is walking towards us and as he sees us he gives my Ma and I a dirty look and rushes the opposite direction. We will NEVER return to this one and will tell everyone we know how horrible it was. What makes it even worse is I wrote them through their website and still have not heard back from them."	1.0

And this comment stems from a second chance after the first nightmare which I went when they first opened. This time around it was slow we was greeted by a young lady at the door who also happen to be our waiter we ordered drinks didn't ask if we wanted to start with a appetizer as soon as we ordered drinks she left for 10minutes came back no drinks asking us are we ready to order or still waiting for drinks I then politely told her we will wait for drinks but I'll like to start on a appetizer she left didn't return until 15 minutes like with appetizer after the bar tender add already dropped our drinks off to us mind you we are sitting on the furthest wall opposite from the bar. When she brought the appetizer she then ask are we ready to order our lunch. We had only took 2 bites of queso and chips so we felt completely rushed so we went ahead and ordered food took at least 30minutes to come out. She sat the food down and walked away then disappeared. Being  that we had sangria we were in need of water but our waitress had disappeared again so another waitress brought us out water. She was gone the rest of our visit she didn't not return until after we finished speaking to the manager . Another disappointment for my mother and I.

We were welcomed by our waitress and ordered our meals.  I ordered the Mango-chili chicken without the spicy sauce on top that I have ordered before.  The waitress stated they were substituting green beans for the broccoli because they ran out.  
After a short wait our meals arrived.  I was unable to eat the green beans because they had NOT BEEN COOKED!  Impossible to even chew. I called another waitress over and she took the beans back to the kitchen.  Then I realized that the chicken was covered in the spicy habanero sauce. When the green beans returned I was still unable to eat them. Terrible! 
The waitress returned and my husband informed her that their was sauce on the chicken and the green beans were still uncooked.

We finished our meal and 10 minutes later we paid our bill at the kiosk because the waitress wasn't around. We finally got a hold of the waitress because our receipt didn't print and also asked for our dessert to go because she never brought it. She said they don't bring it unless you ask for it.  We told her this isn't the first chilis we have been to and the waitress is always attentive to the patrons and do not need to be reminded about when to bring the food out.

It was absolutely disgusting. We recently decided to dine in and watch football on a Sunday though, hoping for a better experience. Unfortunately, we had no such luck. The bartender, Jarrod, was offensive, rude and belligerent the entire time. He made some borderline racist comments, tried WAY too hard to be funny but just came off as an ass instead, cussed repeatedly and put down customers and their sports teams to their faces. Jarrod definitely wasn't the type of employee I imagine Chili's hiring and putting up with and believe they would be just as shocked at his behavior behind the bar as we were. In fact, the overall organization and service at this establishment is an embarrassment to Chili's and should be evaluated. In the mean time, if you're looking for quality food, cooked to your specification, go somewhere else, or drive to the litchfield Park Chili's instead. You'll be glad you did.	3.0

First time I came it had just opened up so kind of gave them some slack and figured after receiving some gift card to try again. I should have went to the location on Litchfield I have never had a problem at that one. Anyways, once again my party of 5 walked in and no one to be found at the hostess station so we stood and looked around for someone finally about 5 mins later the hostess comes from the back in the meantime no else has bothered to ask if we needed help. She does not greet us at all, I tell her party of 5 she reaches down to grab menus and then starts counting my party and says how many 5? Yeah, I thought I already established that. We finally get seated and after a while our waiter comes over and gets drink orders which take a pretty long time considering it's a Weds evening and they are hardly busy at all. When he comes back doesn't bother asking if we have questions, mentions any specials, or ask if we want appetizers so we order our food 3 of my party have special instructions like no onions. A very long time later our food arrives a different waitress drops it off asked if we need anything we tell her yes, drink refills and sides of ranch she ok I get those for you. Well we never saw her again and we also noticed none of our special instructions have been taken care of. So everyone that didn't want onions got them. In the meantime our waiter asks if everything is ok we tell him well we told the other waitress what we needed more drinks and ranch he says ok. We are still waiting assuming one of the two will bring our requests. Didn't happen.  So after a good while half of my party is half way done with their food he sees me looking around and says do you need something. I said yeah all the stuff we asked for like 20 mins ago!!!!!!  So he take his sweet time to bring all our refills and sides of ranch. At this point we are almost done with our food and I just want to get out of here asap. The whole time the manager is of course no where to be found and the hostess leaves her post constantly so I see why we had the 1st problem, I could see from where I sat the same problem with multiple parties they walk in look around and no one is there to greet their customers.

Restaurant was pretty dead. After over 20 minutes a waitress finally came to us and appolgized about wait and said she was the only real one working, the other three were trainees. Another 10 minutes before our drink orders were taken. About another 15 minutes till our food orders were taken. We didn't even get silverware or napkins. I walked around myself till I found the station they were kept at. Drink refills were really hard to get. Really happy I could pay the bill on the machine on the table or I would probably still be there. No visible manager. Not sure what was going on, first time and last time at this location. That's sad because I like Chili's and this is my closest location. I will continue to go to the Goodyear location so we can get decent service.	0.0

I was accompanied by my wife and 5 kids. Kids got their kids meals, wife and i ordered steaks. 45 min. After we ordered we still had not received our main coarse. We ate through three baskets of chips and salsa. Drinks were empty for a while and i asked the male manager on duty and he took the glass. Did not come back for about 20 min, With the refill. Only came back cause we had to remind him. Food finally came out and plates were not clean and presentable. My wife ordered a m sirloin that came out well done. Mashed potatoes were dry and crusty on the top. Their food runner seemed lost as he kept asking all the tables if they had ordered what he had in his hands.Called the manager once again for the steak to be fixed. Asked us what we wanted. Obviously my wifes steak fixed. 25 min. Later still no steak at this point my we are very irritated and pay for our dinner and leave. As we leave the steak hits the table.

We sit take a couple bites and sit and wait and wait for someone to notice us. Finally a server comes over and we explain the situation. Obviously one would expect a new burger made properly. No. She goes to check on what can be done. Meanwhile the burger now sits stone cold. It's been about 15 minutes and we are then brought over separately on a plate a runny egg and soggy half cooked bacon to put on our disgusting cold burger. Neither one of us had been to chilis in a while and we unanimously decided we would not be returning. Hands down worst service from the kitchen and wait staff along w management who said we couldn't get the burger how we wanted. It wasn't overly busy. In a situation such as that mgmt should have come out to explain. On top of it I've barely made it out the door and the four bites are sitting in my gut like a brick. 

Cheers to Mike the bartender who comped it without our asking. He gave us good service."	1.0

First off, the server put the extremely hot skillets directly right in front of my baby sitting in a high chair. Not near, DIRECTLY IN FRONT. I'm sorry but that should be common sense since its so hot. I had to say something cause she kept doing it. Also there was crumbs on my side of the table as we sat down, not sure if they didnt care to clean it or just did a horrible job. Then our check was completely wrong and we were charged double on multiple items. The waitress couldn't figure it out for her life so the manager came said he would fix it. He NEVER came back. I did see him however arguing with an employee. He even questioned us when we told him why are the wontons full price? He said I don't think there part of Happy hour and we told him they were and he said he'd have to check. You think a manager would know their menu better. I'm upset he never came back and never apologized. So our waitress came back after forever with our new checks and they were still completely wrong! They only took 6 dollars off for their mistakes when there was much more. They were so slow and so ignorant we ended up leaving and paying a dessert that was supposed to be free with points, an order of fries we never ordered and a skillet that wasn't on happy hour because the waitress didn't understand what we asked for. It was an awful experience and we tried being friendly about it but when the waitress cuts you off everytime you try to explain and the manager doesn't give a crap, makes me not want to be understanding and nice. Also we all woke up this morning sick with killer stomach aches,  just a heads up for people looking to eat here, a drive to another chili's is what I'd recommend.	2.0

Worst restaurant experience I've had in a while. I admit, i was indecisive, but my request for input on the 2 sandwiches i had in mind was met by crickets. I went with the medium New York Steamer combo, My friend got a simple kids meal.  The restaurant was empty.  A few employees behind the counter, the cashier, a manager perhaps(?) with his hands on his hips ""surveying"", and two guys going back and forth from the prep area, to the kitchen.. one yelling, KNIFE, KNIFE,.... HOT PAN, HOT PAN... I get it safety procedures, cleanup after the lunchtime rush, but hey, you have customers!. After taking 2 more orders,  the CASHIER finally started making our sandwiches ...a good 12-15 minutes later, we got them, the bags surprisingly light.  The kids meal comes with a Fire-hat, had to ask if we could go grab the hat.  Disappointed, We made our way back to work hoping the sandwiches somehow  were worth the wait.   I did a double take, and just had to show my co-workers my $10.76 combo meal, while they laughed and shook their heads at my paltry, limp, dull sandwich. So Embarrassing!

Spent the rest of the day and part of the next morning in the toilet. Talked to their corporate headquarters about my visit, they sounded very interested in my experience. They offered me a free meal. So it took a while for me to give them a second try. Another surprise the person in charge was very rude and condescending when I tried to explain to them very nicely about my supposed free meal without being rude and saying DIARRHEA in front of his customers. I will stick to Jimmy Johns which is right down the street... They have wonderful service and I've never had a problem after eating there.	1.0

Where I was forced to wait 30 minutes for a sandwich which beared no resemblance to the order I gave to the clerk. This was not the end of the terrible experience I suffered during my visit at fire house subs on mill and baseline at old Towne city plaza. My sandwich was not only made poorly but it also contained a large amount of black mold. After going to the restaurant, and very respectively asking for this to be fixed the manager chuckled in my face and said all your getting is a refund. Feeling a bit neglected I went to the owner who basically told me to take a free sandwich and shut up saying ""we have you a free sandwich now quit complaining"".

When I first park and walk up you have an employee sitting on the chairs smoking a cigarette right outside the doors. Off to a poor start, walk in and again no enthusiasm at all. Young man takes my order wearing gloves and goes back to making food with same gloves(gross). Got it to go as I was working and ordered the beef n Cheddar. First bite was great till I noticed not a drop of BBQ sauce. Had a $15 order and the sandwich was dry aside from the ends of the sandwich with mayo. Really wanted to get impressed after the first visit but found my initial opinion to still be correct.

The food (mediocre at best) was typical sandwich fair nothing to big deal about it you can go anywhere and get the same (which I will choose to go ANYWHERE but here in the future) my problem was with the cashier...Joshua V.
This is not how I would hope a business trains their ""management"" to be! First off we were never greeted properly as we entered not that Thats a big deal but the fact that I STOOD IN FRONT OF THE COUNTER AND STILL WAS NOT ACKNOWLEDGED is where I should have know to just turn around and leave! Finally Joshua was able to break away from his oh so important task (watching over his coworkers shoulder) he was ready to take the order. As my 11 y/o daughter was trying to place her order Joshua was very rude and started talking over her (which caused him to miss some of the things she wanted on the sandwich) he then made some awful jokes about what all else could go on..I chose to ignore his uncomical banter and continue.. I started to place another order and again rather then LISTEN to what was being said Joshua AGAIN started talking over me! My girlfriend..seeing my utter frustration with Joshua tried to continue the order specifically stating not wanting the bread toasted (toasted rolls are a bit tough on someone who just had some dental work) but she did want the meat bacon and cheese heated (last time we were there the guy behind the counter made this suggestion and was more then happy to oblige the request..wish I could remember HIS name..he is a keeper!)  Joshua in a most demeaning manor laughed and said that ""Thats just ridiculous"" looking at my girlfriends face at that moment I could tell he had embarrassed her! I was now FUMING!! She apologized to him for making the order ""confusing"" to which Joshua replied ""oh no its not confusing, not at all. Its just ridiculous. You just made my night! I'm literally making fun of you..in front of you"" ....you can best believe my girlfriend had to tell me to walk out of that store and to just wait outside because I was about ready to loose my mind on this jerk!! 
Firehouse sub's, if this is the type of employee you entrust your business to you won't be around for very long! I'd entrust a sub made by Jarod himself rather then spend one more penny at any of your restaurants!!
Sincerely,
Lost customer for life!

The service was awful. Their were 5 young men working behind the counter and every one of them seemed incompetent and lacked any confidence. We were given a crappy unenthusiastic forced greeting when we entered this place. The cashier Braedon was rude. Making a comment to one of his coworkers in an annoyed tone that he was the only one who knew how to work the register before asking us what we wanted to order and talking to coworkers while we were trying to order. 
We waited almost 20 minutes for our sandwiches to get to the table, there were only 4 other tables seated when we got there and one already had their food. While we were eating there was another complaint from a customer sitting across the way that their order wasn't correct and they also had been waiting 20 minutes.

I generally like Olive Garden but this location is the worst. I have visited this location on several occasions and I am always disappointed when I come here. My favorite dish is the Fettuccine Alfredo with grilled chicken which is such a basic dish that is usually good. Here, this dish is bland, tasteless and has little to no seasonings. IT SUCKS! When I received my food I had to request more Alfredo sauce since my food was extremely dry. My pasta was so dry that it was almost sticking together. I am a lover of their salad and bread sticks but have always been let down here. When they brought  the salad out, I had to ask for more dressing because it was as if they had literally put only 2 drops of dressing on the salad. I also had to ask for FRESH bread sticks since the first ones that the waitress brought out were very hard and dark like they had been sitting under the heating lamp for a very long time. It was just a very unpleasant meal. The only thing that I did enjoy was the fact that I was spending time with family and friends.	1.0

Last night, 9:30pm, I'm running too close to 10pm for my own good since I don't want a burger.  GrubHub sucks so I called Olive Garden.  This Olive Garden on 75th Avenue and Thomas Road.  Fiesta Mall.

I ordered dinner, jumped in the car, reached the restaurant and by my clock and I'm meticulous about setting the correct time, it was 9:54pm.  When I got the to the front door, it was locked.

Now, let's examine this: I do understand security and I do understand that restaurants are being robbed more than in the past.  But there are no mass murderers in the news, and you are operating a frigging restaurant that is supposedly open to the public, but you gotta lock up before closing time.  A little overbearing?  Yes.  I think so.

But that's not the bad part.  The bad part is, while I pounded on the glass, I counted 11 employees working inside the restaurant that WOULD NOT ACKNOWLEDGE ME.  ELEVEN!  

That's training.  Or lack of training.  Seemingly no one has reminded/told them to be courteous.   Not one person motioned, like with a #1 finger, meaning,  ""just a second"", or ""let me get the manager"" nothing.  THEY JUST IGNORED ME.  That is personally offensive.  And it pissed me off.  On my worst day, I've never treated a customer like that.

Today I called Darden Corporate Customer Service, owner of Olive Garden and they were closed.  Monday, 2:15pm Phoenix-time, Customer Service for all of Darden Restaurants, which include Olive Garden, Capitol Grille, Bahama Breeze, Yard House, Eddie V's, Season's 52 and Longhorn Steakhouse is closed.  It's only open from10am-4pm EDT.  How truly underwhelming is that?  ""We don't care because we don't have to"" or something.  Like the locked door, the bunker mentality reception I got was truly underwhelming.

Note to bald manager: you're in the ""P"" business, buddy, but it isn't ""pasta"".  It's ""people"".  You moron."	5.0

My mom ordered the tilapia and shrimp platter and I ordered the chicken shrimp carbonara. The presentation was not impressive and quite messy, but hey, looks are deceiving lol. My mothers tilapia and shrimp was messy looking as well, tilapia looked very bland as if was over poached. I bite into my dish and it's bland and taste nothing but heavy cream.

Our server was very soft spoken so it was hard to hear him, but he was still a good server so it was ok. He brought us Andes mints with my to go box, as well as with the check! Love those things! We also got a slice of pumpkin cheesecake to go. We have yet to eat it, but I'm sure it will be tasty. The biggest downfall of Olive Garden is it can be kind of noisy since there's usually a lot of people there with their families. Tonight there was a child screeching at the top of his/her lungs that we could hear from across the restaurant. But did the parents ever take him/her outside? No, of course not! Some people just don't give any thought to anyone else and it's unfortunate. I was told that the location on Bell Rd has little tablets at the tables that you can order/pay on now. Wish this one had those! I think that's totally awesome.

UPDATE: I have to revise my review after heating up my leftovers. Something was wrong with the chicken parm... The meat was tough to cut and when I took a bite, I spit it out. It was inedible. I don't know what it was but it was nothing like the piece of chicken I ate for dinner. It was absolute junk... like processed tendons. I wish I had tried that piece when we were at the restaurant so I could have asked for a new one. So disappointing. Because of this, I have to drop the rating from 4 stars to 2."	2.0

Aside from our server who did a great job tonight, I have never been so DISGUSTED by what we were served. We've come to this location for years, and to celebrate our 5 year wedding anniversary, we came here to do so. We bought a bottle of wine, and in every glass we were given, there was old food on each one. Water glasses, dirty. And then we get our forks, and there is still food on them. We get served our food and we decline because as petty as it may sound to some, using dirty dishes is just as equivalent to finding hair or bugs in our meal. You would assume that we would have been greatly discounted on our bill but for only consuming wine and breadsticks, we still received a 50 bill. I'm just disappointed. That seems incredibly unacceptable. I have never left a review before, and this evening was just so terrible that I had to. Shame on the managment in this building, it wasn't just dirty dishes you served to us, it was also an awful evening you left us with and a long time customer that you've LOST.	2.0

My wife and daughter ordered shrimp Fettuccini and I decided to ordered the ""create your own pasta option"" Rigatoni pasta, Primavera sauce and chicken. My son decided on the kids pizza. We occasionally dine at different restaurants throughout the valley. The food arrived 20minutes later. My wife and I where completely flabbergasted with both dishes we ordered. My wife shrimp in her dish were very small over cooked and tasteless and tasted raw. The dish was very bland. It was so bad that she could not finish eating it and left it on the table.

I don't know if this was normal for this location or not, but I will never eat here again.

My server asked how my dinner was, and I told her that it was not very good I asked for an additional side Primavera sauce to try to possible help this poor dish! but she said unfortunately they had no more sauce??. I then stated I was very unhappy and embarrassed for them, she then stated she was sorry to hear it, and reported to the manager on duty.

I was shortly contacted by the Manager on duty by the name of McKenzie. I expressed to McKenzie my horrible experience and concerns of the location. McKenzie apologized for my poor experience and stated he was from another location and was just helping out. I was accommodated with one meal completely removed from my total excellent customer service on McKenzie part! But this location definitely needs a visit from whom ever it concerns ASAP."	0.0

 I ordered the cheese ravioli with tomato sauce. I literally could taste the package it came out of! There is nothing fresh about Olive Garden, not even the salad, which is soaked in house dressing and stale croutons. Other than the food which was lacking, so was the service.

What went right: we got excellent parking.

What went wrong:   We were seated in a closed off nook, in which asking to be reseated resulted in the hostess rolling her eyes at me. 
They were out of children's menus!!!
We waited a long while for our server, Christian to find us. 
After taking out drink order he vanished again for quite some time.
When he reappeared we asked him to get salad and breadsticks out asap (kids were starving) he said he wouldn't do that until we gave him our entree order. He disappeared again.
When he returned we asked him again to bring that out asap as we were about to order. Again he said no and disappeared without taking our order. We sent another server to find him and he comes back and asks what do we need?! We told him we had been waiting to order but he keeps disappearing. He took our order and still no salad or breadsticks.
20 - 25 minutes later he brings salad and breadsticks followed by our entrees. We tell him there is no way we can eat all of this at the same time so he offers to take the entrees back to the kitchen. We rejected that idea given the likely hood we'd never see him again.
Finally, all of our entrees were cold. The salad was all  chunky white parts with little teeny bits of green lettuce. It was soggy and distasteful.  We never got refills on our peach teas or sodas.
We asked another server to hunt down Christian but instead some super sassy girl walks over and asks what we wanted. We told her we'd like our server. With even more sassiness she said why don't you tell me what you guys want so I can get it! I asked her to send the manager over and she said she would. 10 minutes  later after no Christian and no manager I approached the hostess area and spoke to the snotty hostess with a bad hair dye job (she sat us)again. This time she was nicer when I asked for the manager.
The manager was ok. She took all the events lightly. She did comp a couple of the 5 adult meals but left the rest on our check. Each and every meal was only partially eaten because of it being cold or tasting horrible. 
When I returned to our table I was really surprised that Christian was STILL NO WHERE TO BE FOUND not even the manager knew his whereabouts. 

Ultimately,  he reappeared when the sassy waitress tells him we left him a $20 tip. He had a shockface! He lost out! My husband is the most generous tipper.

The food that was supposed be hot was warm with the exception of the soups, they were piping hot. Maybe it was the time  of day that I came in because I heard good things about this restaurant.  I know the first time I was there (when it first opened, it was excellent. The food was hot and delicious). Not on my second and third trip there. I even tried their restaurant on 51st & Bell before they closed. That one was even worse than the one at Metro which is why it may no longer be in business. I don't know why I kept going back. Maybe the buffet looked so tempting and the restaurant was crowded I thought something isn't right or it must be me. I do know if you can catch the dishes as they come out of the kitchen  when they come out fresh they are very good.

But this place reminds me of all the other C - rated Chinese buffets in Phoenix. I'm generally not a fan of buffets and Hibachi Grill & Supreme Buffet is nothing special. it is typical of the buffets here, you get what you pay for but the food looks good and they have a lot of choices (a wide selection) so everyone will eventually find something they want to eat there if you can stomached warm - cold food that is supposed to be hot. But it is it's all you can eat.


The last time I went here with my wife I walked around the buffet once, walked around twice... and walked around one last time and NOTHING looked appetizing at all!  I ended up having soup because I could see the steam coming from it and knew it would be hot. . 

We should've known better, judging from the demographics of the place.  I shouldn't have given them additional chances and just got the heck out! 

CUSTOMER SERVICE:  Is average, they'll do their job like any other buffet restaurant. AMBIANCE: The buffet presentation is very basic, Once you walk in, one side has all the food and kitchen area, the other side is tables and chairs, and booths. FOOD: The food experience was just that- an 'experience. Frankly the health department should really come in and take a look at the food temperatures of the buffet. I am surprised people haven't got sick from food poisoning at this restaurant!  CONCLUSION: I'm writing out of disappointment for wasting $$ at this place.

And we have been getting the loyalty stamps every time we go to this place, except for today. As usual, I showed my military ID to receive my military discount as soon as we got our table. 

For the first time, we were told by the owner's daughter who is in charge today that we could not receive the loyalty stamp because I received my 10% discount on my part (but my spouse paid full price). We were not informed of the policy change when I showed my military ID. No one told us anything until after I paid for our check. 

My point is that an early notice will be appreciated. Besides, if my spouse came in by herself and paid full price for her own meal, she would still receive a loyalty stamp. Why wouldn't we receive a loyalty stamp when we both paid almost $30 together before adding tips to it? I personally do not appreciate how they handled it. Plus today's food was definitely more greasy than usual. Ice-cream was melting even before I opened the lid. Would I want to go back? I am not too sure anymore. I may just have to drive a little further out to Jasmine Tokyo in Scottsdale from now on or go to the Pacific Seafood Buffet in Chandler which is near my work. Those two buffet restaurants also offer military discounts, and their food quality is definitely better. Besides, I have just tried out an excellent ""all you can eat sushi"" restaurant (order as you go, not the buffet style) in Gilbert called Orient Sushi Grill.

The problem started when being seated by a thoroughly unprofessional person, dressed in attire better suited to a teens bedroom, certainly not what I want to see when going to eat!

The problem was yet to come however, as we were seated, we were asked not if we wanted additional drinks, but what flavor sodas we would like. I did not ask if they were included in the meal, because she was presenting them as part of the meal.

When we paid, we then found out they were not included in the meal, not really a big deal, except the way she presented the request was deceitful. 
I could live with that sort of, after all it is a Chinese Buffet place and some are not so honest it turns out. 

The problem really became an issue when I called and explained to the manager what had happened and because this was the second time we had a problem at Hibachi Grill, we would not be returning. 

The person on the phone kept telling me it was my own fault, I should have know the drinks were not included. He told me I actually had the responsibility to know what she meant! 

There is nothing in this place that states the drink policy. The manager kept telling me he was listening when I told him he was not listening, as he was just blowing me off, by telling me it was all my fault!

I only wanted to talk to him about how she tricked us and I felt it was not very customer friendly. After attempting to talk to him, I could see how the hostess was most likely coached by his poor attitude to lie to customers. 

Long and short of the story, do not go there. Not very honest, and this is the second time I have had a problem there. The first one was an issue with my card and their attempt to double charge me.

I was craving chinese one day after leaving the mall & we decided to give it a try and grab some take out. It wasn't too bad and the price was reasonable so we came back a couple times a dined in. Sadly, today will be our last time we ever go there. I went to grab a second plate of food and as I sat down a roach crawled right past me on the table and onto the ledge. I seriously froze and didnt know what to do. I was watching the roach crawl past the customers in front of me only to see another one right next to the customer on the back rest of their booth.. The hostess that was there walked right past it and looked directly at it and kept walking.. I still want to hurl. That is so unsanitary and disgusting. If that happens right in front of house where customers are sitting and eating I don't even want to imagine what goes on in that kitchen.

I would have thought that coming in at around 5:30 PM, things would have been fresh or at least close to fresher for the dinner crowd.  NOPE...many items appeared to have been sitting there awhile, which I never touched.  I went for things that looked fresh/recently replenished.  I tried their sushi, that was a mistake, many of the items appeared to have recently been put out, because there was so much...again, NOPE...it had to have been sitting there for at least an hour or more...the rice was already hard, not semi, but crunchy...not good.  Probably the only hot item they had worth commenting on is the deep fried shrimp...actually good size shrimp and the breading was fairly crispy.  The only items that were decent, the mandarin oranges, that clearly came out of a can and their desserts, that were purchased some place else and they just put on the buffet line.  The service was slow, which is bad, considering there were like 4 servers and about 6 tables...I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone and I wouldn't go back myself...	2.0

I had started to sweat by the time we were done eating (they sat us right under a fan). The sushi was old probably because there was barely anyone in there and has been sitting too long (went about 3:30pm on a Friday paid dinner rate in which you get krab legs, roast, coconut shrimp and crawfish). The crawfish was very good. I did not like the coconut shrimp at all but my son did. The fried ""dungeon"" crab leg custers were a big joke, they were so small they barely had any meat in them.

It was really a big deal. Since all the other Asian restaurants shut down there.

First of all ,only a few items to choose from. Which maybe is understandable, since they need quick food ready to go.
However, it is mostly all the really fatty foods. So I got a salad that was pre made.
High price, but I know it is the airport.
I had to wait for the girl to come to ring me up. She was angry and not happy to be there, and way too  busy talking to the other workers there about their personal life.

That drives me crazy, plus I was the only one there at that moment.
The 60 seconds that it takes to ring me up my order, should not take away from your personal chatter.  Plus I had to ask for a bag.
When I did eat the salad it was full of white lettuce and the spine of the lettuce. Why do restaurants always do that now?

Despite working in an airport, the women taking orders had no concept of time.  Waited a good 20 minutes for the food while these women took their time handing out the completed orders that were already waiting on the counter.  Then they had some discussion about something and just stopped getting the food ready for a couple of minutes.  Again, food was ready and just sitting on the counter.

We have ordered from here many times because we love PJ pizza. Unfortunately, every time we ask for / pay for extra garlic sauce pods with our delivery order, the extra sauce NEVER comes!!! It is so frustrating and disappointing!! And if you call to alert them of their mistake, they say there is nothing they can do about it unless you want to come to their location to pick it up. Why do you think we ordered delivery!!?? The pizza seems to always turn out fine but if you have any extra requests for your order, you can almost count on that your pizza wishes will not come true.	3.0

A few weeks ago I ordered pizza from this location. I did it on accident, thinking it was the location closest to my house. When I got the order back to my house, I realize they forgot all of my sauces, but they were all listed on my receipt. 

I called the store and talked to the manager, who said that because it was an online order, he couldn't do anything to help me this time, but told me he'd notate my account and would credit me for next time. 

Well, I just called in and talked to the same manager who told me that he didn't see any credits on my account and refused to help me out at all. So I paid in full for a bunch of sauces and then got duped out of a refund for my missing sauces. Not good customer service. Not the Papa way."	0.0

Now if you read the review below I was suppose to receive the items within 50 minutes per ""TJ"". Order has still not been received, guess his word as a ""manager"" isn't worth much. Suggestion to owners - sounds like someone should have some much needed training on customer service. 

I ordered online at 4pm to have pizzas and sides delivered at 5:30 pm. 1st of all, delivery was a little late (not a huge deal), driver did not bring plates as requested (again not a huge deal - he apologized for not having them). Then when the pizzas and sides were all opened to start eating, I noticed that we were shorted on the garlic knots AND the cheese cups that were ordered at $0.75 each. So I called and spoke to TJ at this location who told me he was the ""manager"", which I find it a little hard to believe since he basically called me a liar. After a lengthy conversation with him he agreed to send out the garlic knots again and the cheese cups. Delivery time to be 50 minutes. Unacceptable especially considering that the order was placed a good 1.5 hours prior to requested delivery time and it was not my fault that I was shorted on the knots and cheese cups. 

The manager informed me that not all of his employees had common sense and couldn't perform their jobs accurately at which point I told him that if he was the manager then it was HIS job to make sure that all of the orders went out accurately. Of course at this point he told me that he was being kind enough to replace the items that were missing from my order so what else did I expect him to do. 

Now if I were the manager of a store like this, first thing I would have done was apologize to the customer, but instead he told me that the driver forgot the cheese cups as this happens all the time and that he knew for a fact that there were 8 garlic knots in the order when he put them into the oven. So he called me a liar and then blamed everything else on the driver. WOW!  I would think that whoever owns this location would get a handle on things in his/her store. Bad managers = orders being placed at a different pizza place.  If I were in the Papa John's ""family"", I would be ashamed of this ""relative""."	0.0

1. You will not get what you ordered. Don't try to reason with the owner. He doesn't care. He'll deliver whatever the f*** he wants.

2. The owner (Jose) does not care about your business. Jose is not interested in correcting or apologizing for a mistake. He would rather come get his shitty food and refund your money.

3. The food looks and smells horrible. The wings were literally burnt. The pizza is a very large equivalent of a Totinos frozen pizza. The Sausages are very poor quality. Have you ever had a McDonald's breakfast burrito? I swear, these are the same tiny sausages! Please see pictures.

4. Olympus Pizza is in the same price range as Barros, Venezia's and even Domino's! You don't need to eat this horrible food! Treat yo self.

5. I am proud to present Olympus Pizza with 1 full star! Even though I made them come get their shitty food soon after it was delivered, I was swiftly refunfed.

The remainder of the wings were at least edible, but weren't anything to get excited about. Guess the wings are cheap for a reason. In addition, the delivery time was atrocious, nearly an hour and a half. The only reason I'm not giving them a 1-star, is because the 2-liter they delivered was nice and cold.

... the pizza is good but the service is f** horrible. The owner (JOSE) had the nerve to reject me getting a discount. I was a loyal customer for months but today Im done with this place. 
- So I get my pizza cold a couple of times, about 2 hours to get it at one point. I ALWAYS order red crushed pepper and they also forgot it too. I complained to Jose he said I had to speak to ""the manager"" to get a discount because I had been complaining before so I didn't expect them to mess up my order again. I asked him for his name and I told him next time he would verify my story. He said ""yeah my name is Jose speak to the manager next time.""
- I called a second time and the girl picked up (don't know her name). Anyways .. I tell her what happened and she says she doesn't have my address written in the ""bulletin board"" for compensations of messed up orders. She tells me she will write it and Next Time I'll get it. 
- which brings it to today 5/01 * I just called about an hour ago and another guy picked up. I explained once again what happened. I was telling him Its not about the fucking discount it's about getting my order right !!!!! He told me Jose and the girl would arrive soon so I called back. Jose answered and told me that HE WAS THE MANAGER , that he never promised me a discount, (this was the guy that told me he would verify my story to the manager) turns out this A****** is the manager. What type of place is this?  Yeah the pizza is good but its not worth ordering from a place where they PROMISE YOU THINGS AND DON'T stick to their promises. As a loyal customer I expected more of them. Not to mention they have changed the size of pizzas. Reducing the amount you get. An EXTRA LARGE is LITERALLY THE SAME SIZE AS A LARGE. I've kept the boxes to determine if I was going crazy or not. Anywho thanks for all the times I got cold pizza WILL NEVER ORDER AGAIN .. AND FOR YOU JOSE LEARN HOW TO RUN A BUISNESS.

I ordered 3 simple things; wings, a salad, and some fries for my daughter. Maybe my expectations are too high, but if you pay $6.50 for a Caesar salad, you expect it to be bigger than a handful and a half of lettuce with flavorless croutons. The dressing was good though, I can admit that. Now my daughter likes her fries cold so she was okay but I don't like knowing that they pass off cold fries as fresh. The wings were sadly as disappointing as the salad. They were basically just covered in grease, I've never seen mild wing sauce that didn't stick to the wing at all before. The container just had a puddle of grease at the bottom. At least they were not cold. I actually regret giving the delivery guy a $5 tip for bringing this mediocre food to my home. I can certainly say that I will never order from them again unless they change the price to equate what you are getting.

HOT FOOD at that. The pizza is equivalent to a cheap ass flavorless, sauce-less, pizza. 7-11 has better pizza than this place. The 20 piece wings sucked, find a chicken that actually has meat on it so that way when you over cook the wings there is something inedible to chew on.

Unfortunately my younger son had a very small thin and sharp chicken bone in his chicken chimichanga which I found very alarming.

The drinks were very watered down but also tasted very off and they were fresh off the bar so the ice hadn't even melted yet.  We asked the server about the drinks and while he offered to get us new ones he seemed a bit defensive and gave us the impression they'd be the same...  The queso was also very different (think Mac & Cheese without the noodles).  I had the pollo fundido for my entree.  The chicken was very dry.  It came with larger chunks of chicken vs shredded chicken which would have been fine if it had any flavor and wasn't dried out.  I ended up nibbling left overs from our kids plates as grilled cheese and chicken fingers were sadly the best thing on the table.	0.0

The spinach con queso dip is really syrupy. It also tastes like it came from a can. Watch the plates, they don't clean them well. Even the tables around us had to request new plates because they were dirty. The quesadillas was okay but not work $8.50 happy hour cost.

Chips and salsa were ok; nothing special.   Ordered sangrias which tasted like wine over ice- no fruit- basically watered down wine. 
I ordered the steak fajitas which weren't good at all.   Meat had no taste- in fact I thought it was just microwaved meat.  The onions and peppers were chunks (instead of slices) and end pieces.   My rice and beans looked and tasted as if the plate was under the heater too long as you could clearly see it was dried  up.  The lettuce (brown edges) and tomatoes were not fresh at all. The guacamole and sour cream were served on top of each other as I had to go under the sour cream to see where the guacamole was. 
The server brought the bill without asking if we wanted any dessert.  I figured I needed to walk away with something good from this meal so we ordered the sopapillas.   Again- disappointment as soon as I saw the plate.  It looked like brown dinner rolls on a plate with cinnamon placed on the edges.  I felt like these too were microwaved.  
Overall I have no plans or interest to go back to this place.  
The only good thing out of my dinner was the company I was with."	1.0

Boy was I wrong! I recently had the opportunity of trying to dine at this location only to find the service two notches below mediocre. Our server doubled as a bartender hence the lack of attention to his tables. After ordering two dinner plates it took over 45 minutes to have our food delivered only to find our food had been sitting somewhere in the kitchen with no one taking any responsibility for which table to deliver it to. The food at this location does not meet up to the quality of the one on Northern and 12th Street. Your better off going to Taco Bell. I might try this place in about another year when maybe they get their act together and the company takes a look at the consistency of their food in comparison with their other location.	2.0

Drinks:
Whole table got margaritas, and when the waiter went to set down my boyfriends drink, he spilled a bunch of it all over his side of the table and did not apologize nor acknowledge it, it was very odd thing to witness for the whole table. They use low quality tequila and serve the margaritas in small normal cups, not your typical margarita glass. If you want a good cheap margarita, I suggest Golden Margarita from Costco and just bring that with you if you get dragged here.

Food:
 Chips and salsa were okay, but the 'hotter' salsa just tasted like chili powder and water mixed together. It was the same thing with the beans. The beans were almost inedible with the amount of salt, chili powder and whatever else they put into them. How can you mess up classic refried beans !? Mexican rice was good, so was the Pollo Fundido and Fajitas Quesadilla, good guacomole and sauce. We also got the sampler plate and cheese crisp which were okay. There are many better hole in the wall mexican joints that you can go to in Arizona or really anything ending in ""berto's"".

Service:
The location is new, and most of the waiters are young kids, so it seems like there is still a learning curve for the waiters. As mentioned before, our waiter did not apologize nor help clean up for a spill he caused. He also forgot items that we ordered several times and we had to remind him. Also, at the end of the meal, a girl sets down a tray full of food next to our table and it was our exact order all over again, so they had put in our order twice! We said we didnt mind getting a second meal for free though. They seem to be pretty scattered but im sure theyll get it together."	0.0

This is a family friendly restaurant but they do offer a full bar that is walled in the center of the restaurant. They also offer a smoking patio. 

The restaurant has a left side dining room with tables and u shaped booths. The center of the restaurant is a walled in bar. The left side dining room is long and narrow and on one side are tables and the other side are booths. Canned Mexican Music fills the air...the same music I remember Chi-Chi's played...

Lets get to the food.

It seems whoever came up with the recipes has an allergy to seasoning food.

They start you off with complimentary chips and salsas. I don't know if they make their chips but ours were free of salt and tasted less tasty than from most bagged varieties. Our mild salsa was also free of salt and tasted weak. The spicy salsa was very strange and tasted fruity so I fear my salsa might have had some sort of collusion with someone's beverage.

I had the Chicken Taco Salad Fajita Style. I received a fried flour bowl filled with mostly iceberg lettuce and unripe raw tomatoes. On top was some caramelized white meat chicken. I also received American Style sour cream, shredded cheese and unseasoned guacamole.

Disappointing :(

 THIS WAS THE MOST UNINSPIRED SALAD I EVER HAD ANYWHERE! NOBODY put any thought into this salad as it was boring as heck. ""Fajita Style"" should be with bell peppers and onions like a fajita. All I got was boring chicken over boring tasteless salad. It could have been named Unseasoned Boring Grilled Chicken Salad in a Flour Bowl. 

It's a toss up between one star and two stars but I generously went with two stars because the chicken was ok and our server tried.

We sat down and a very nice server named Sam came over to take our, we order soft drinks and we're informed that they were out of Dr Pepper, Coke and Sierra Mist....ok, I almost have to have a Coke when I'm eating Mexican food. So I'm informed Sam that I was going to Jacksons and buying some Cokes and bringing them back. I got into my truck to go get the drinks, and now my truck smelled so bad from the sewer that I had to drive over there with my windows down! On to the food.... a TV dinner would have been better!

I was so taken back by that but that's okay God blessed us with a better spot to sit.

The food by the time we got it was cold, beans were so salty, the guacamole was disgusting, had no taste at all, the chips most of them were burnt and grease at the bottom of the bowl, my guest food, he said his was fine, she ate most of her salad, but mine seriously wasn't good.  I was so disappointed as I love this restaurant, used to be the main Mexican food place I'd go out of my way to.  The place itself was charming but the food was not so charming.

I was so disgusted by the food that I wanted to walk out. I ordered the #13 which included a green tamale, 2 mini chimis, mini bean tostada, 2 mini taquitos and beans.  The tamale was so soft that it fell apart and was inedible. The beans were crusty and old. The waitress never asked once how the food was. She noticed half my food on my plate and didn't even bother asking if everything was ok. My husbands food was equally as bad so we both left hungry. The chips and salsa taste like something you buy from the store. My fault for cheating on Manuels! Lesson learned!	0.0

We went for an early dinner and we're seated right away which was nice because I was starving. We got chips with  a mild salsa and a hot salsa. Nothing special but it good none the less.

I ordered the combo with a ground beef taco and a ground beef enchilada. First off, most of the meals only come with beans and you have to order the rice separately from the a la carte. I found this to be a bit annoying. Secondly, the food was not good. The meat had zero flavor and the taco shell for the taco was stale. Normally when I am as hungry as I was, I'll still eat it even if it's not spectacular but I didn't even want to finish the rest of my meal. 

We also ordered 2 grande margaritas which were on happy hour. They were ok but seeing as it was a grande, it simply came in a pint glass. 

I was really excited to try this place because it's so close to home but they really need to step it up if they want to stay in business. The fast food Mexican restaurants in the area far surpass them with flavor and you get rice and beans."	0.0

We started off with potato skins and a half order of nachos. The menu states it comes with your choice of meat but our server never asked us what type of meat. It all happened so fast that we didn't really get a chance to specify. Of course the nachos came out without any meat, I'm assuming when he puts the order in he's prompted to choose the meat and he decided to just put no-meat instead of coming to ask us. When the nachos came, I asked about it and he said in an accusatory tone ""you didn't specify"". I didn't like him, he had an attitude the whole time. 

The music playing when we got there was great, a little old school alternative. But, in the middle of our meal they changed it to rap music, very-very loud rap music. While I do listen to that music, it has a time and a place. Mid-afternoon in a sports bar is not the place.

This establishment was originally a Hooter's and the decor is a carry-over from that period.  A variety of  ""regular"" and  ""high-top""  tables dot the dining room, and there's an outside dining area with ample seating.  The bar seats perhaps 15-20.  There are a LOT of TVs tuned to a variety of channels, and all are muted.  Music plays over the house system.  Overall, it is quite inviting.

The location is convenient, at the corner of 48th Street and Chandler, just east of I-10.

Thursday Feb19 four of us went to Tukee's for beer and food around 7pm that evening.  The place was busy but not full.  There were tables open.  We were greeted and seated promptly.

The music was ""country"" at a comfortable level, allowing the four of us to talk readily.

All four of us thought our food was very good.
- Three had burgers, which were larger patties on toasted buns
- Two had onion rings with the burgers
- One had home-made potato chips with the burger
- One had a avocado chicken wrap ""sandwich""

The domestic beer draughts were reasonably priced.


Sunday Feb22 we returned to Tukee's, arriving at about 6:30pm.  The place was not very busy, with only a few patrons (which is what we expected for a Sunday evening) in the dining room and at the bar. We were greeted and seated promptly.

The music was some sort of ""hip-hop"", but it was at a comfortable level, allowing the four of us to talk readily.   The music selection didn't really match the clientele, most of which were 30+ (with the exception of a family with a couple of kids around 12-14, and a few patrons at the bar perhaps in their later 20s).  

The waitress obliged when we asked her to change one of the TVs to ESPN2.

We all had the same food as before (see above) and but the quality was not as good ; that was OK though, I  ""chalked it up""  to the fact the kitchen wasn't as busy and probably wasn't well staffed (this being a Sunday).

At some point in the evening, the hip-hop music got quite a bit louder and conversation became difficult, but manageable.  But, at one point some hip-hop tune came on with lyrics of  ""f___""  and   ""bit__""   used repeatedly, and we got fed up.   We called the waitress; she obliged and promptly changed the ""channel"" (satellite radio, perhaps?  It wasn't a juke box.) and turned-down the volume.   Oddly, it seemed to us that the only people in the place that might have enjoyed the music was the staff  itself; as we looked around the room, almost everyone was 30+ (see my notes above). 

So, I rate the place as hit-or-miss.  I would go back and take the risk; the food was good and the drink prices reasonable.  If the music gets obnoxious again, we'll probably leave and take our business elsewhere.

Oh, one final remark.  Some other reviews (around Feb 2015) make note of ""the smell"".  This place has some sort of problem (with the sewer or a vent?) and, occasionally, it smelled like sh__  at our table in the dining room (and we were seated far away from the bathrooms).   Honestly, the smell wasn't persistent; it only occurred a couple of times and we only noticed it on our second visit (Sunday Feb22).  I might assume they'll have the problem addressed before long."	1.0

The girl at the front with the long blonde hair is beyond rude and NEVER has a nice look on her face EVER (yet he keeps her at the door).

Chef Irvine, Chef Ramsey, please salvage the good name of Ahwatukee! I haven't had a burger THIS bad since my childhood when my father would gleefully ignite the kettle grill with half a bottle of starter fluid & produce burgers that looked exactly like the charcoal briquets upon which they were cooked! I ordered a ""medium"" bleu cheese & bacon burger that was a quarter inch thick, had a sad, anemic tomato slice and cold fries. The single star is for the cheerful service. I feel sorry for the wait staff who has to serve this crap. I would not have gone to this bar, which is all it is, if not for the fact that my favorite Meetup group was gathering there for Happy Hour. Thank heavens for all the good company. We did not go unannounced, either. And we didn't all order our food at the same time. The menu touts the burger meat grind as something truly special: Special if you like preformed frozen thin patties that are cooked within an inch of their lives! To their credit, there actually was some bleu cheese, the bacon was crisp, the sautéed onions properly cooked and the bun was soft, fresh & nicely toasted. So, after removing the burger patty, the tomato & the limp, insipid pickles & lettuce I was left with bruschetta. Complained politely to the the waitress who seemed genuinely surprised stating that they are ""known"" for their burgers. But no offer of another menu item or a refund. I could have had a better burger at the nearby Carl's Jr., and I am not a fast food fan! And I'm NOT kidding when I say that they actually have cards on the tables that say if you give them a good Yelp review, you'll get a free dessert or $1 alcoholic drink! REALLY????? I was at the very least expecting basic bar food, I would have had better from the freezer & the microwave. My dinner companion tried the nachos; equally disgusting!  Vile canned nacho cheese sauce & ground beef that was so overcooked that it looked like black nuggets of grease! Thank heavens there's an Urgent Care less than a quarter of a mile away!

The waitress handling our section stopped by the table right next to is and then apparently was kidnapped by space aliens and taken away to their planet for experimentation because we never saw her again. There were maybe so tables with people eating and two guys at the bar. I've heard of overworked but I don't think this was the case. 

We waited about ten minutes which doesn't seem like a long time but it only takes five seconds to greet a table a take a drink order. We left and won't be back. We headed to Naber's which has never disappointed."	5.0

It was actually surprising how rude our waitress was, but it was a busy Friday night so I shrugged it off as a bad evening and not necessarily a bad employee. But returning yesterday, the service was poor in a different way. We were basically ignored for our whole visit except when we got our food (which was pretty speedy so no complaints there). But because it was not busy it was a little frustrating that we had to wait 40 minutes for our check. The waitress was friendly enough, but never checked on us, checked on our waters, or brought us our check until we asked. Probably won't be back again.	1.0

This review remains at 1 star. If I could make it zero, I would. I coordinated a trivia night with friends here tonight and boy do I regret it. I hadn't been here since 2012. Check the very first tip on this place. Yeah, that was me. Stupid of me to come back 5 years later thinking they would have improved. The ONLY reason we came here was because we rotate to different trivia locations every month. I chose to give this place the benefit of the doubt. I should've checked their reviews beforehand. I would've never come here. I can't stress that enough. 

My 6 year old nephew ordered a grilled cheese sandwich. They cheese wasn't even melted. We returned it and asked for a second sandwich. The cheese STILL WASN'T MELTED. I spoke with the manager. She apologized, of course, and didn't charge me for the meal. But I left. Immediately. I should have made my group leave with me. But they stayed for trivia. The group consensus was ""food was mediocre, service was slow, and no one got happy hour pricing because she entered the order at 7:01."" 

Apparently their AC was also broken. My friend asked them 'what time did it break' thinking it broke today and the hostess said 'oh a few days ago' smh seriously?? 

my group ended up winning third place in trivia and a $10 voucher. NO ONE wants to come back here. And none of us will ever come back.

The seating, however, was very uncomfortable because the seat was hard on my rear and my back. The tables were uncomfortable because they were small and without legroom. This made sitting side by side difficult for my wife and I. 
The service was ok. The hostess was very accommodating. Once we sat I waited awhile for the server to take my food order but, otherwise, she was ok. 
The food was horrible. My wife and I ordered spinach dip and nachos to share.  The chips were too thin, even for their spinach dip, so they constantly broke. The nachos were very bland and all the ingredients came from a can. It came with mild salsa but I wanted more spice. The only hot sauce available was Tabasco. I don't drink so I cannot rate their drinks.

Our favorite menu items weren't on the menu. Gone are the bacon burgers and now are the burgers with pears and raspberry jam. This is a sports bar right? Granted you can build your own burger, but you have to pay separately for every topping. I didn't do the math, but felt like if I built my own, it would've ended being an expense burger, so I didn't even bother.

The nachos were a stack of chips with cheese only on the top layer. The jalapeños on the nachos were good and seemed fresh, but that was about it.

I also ordered the Cali Grilled Chicken avocado sandwich. I've eaten this dish here before, as it was on the old menu. Only this time the chicken was really dry.

Needless to say if your in the mood for ""sports bar"" food this is not the place.

As we were eating the band started. The sound system was so loud that we seriously couldn't hear each other, and we were sitting as far away from the band as you could be with still being outside.

Upon entering, I was immediately turned-off by our waitress who was overly friendly, invasive, and needed her fingers to count if I was 21 or not. However, she was attentive, and came by several times to see how we were doing, which I appreciated. Sounds like some other Yelpers didn't get the same treatment!

The food was mediocre at best, but the prices are relatively low and they bring a ton of food so it's easy to split and save a little. The menu is long, but there's absolutely nothing interesting on it. No interesting twist on American favorites, no chef creations, nothing. Just the same standard food you can get at any American restaurant. 

For an appetizer we split the supreme nachos with pulled pork and they were decent. Definitely better than I thought it would be, with a small kick. For my meal, I ordered the fish and chips, which was okay. The fish was a little too greasy, and it was wide, flat pieces, instead of the traditional thicker long slices. The crust was also strangely spicy, which I did not appreciate. The fries were mediocre--definitely had better.

They were breaded with I don't know what, microwaved, and then someone emptied a teriyaki marinade, not glaze, frickin' salty as heck marinade!  Marinade is a marinade, you marinate in it prior to cooking, not drown the food before service.  I was served 10, ate 6, too damn nasty.  At least the carrots were fresh!
My wife got chicken tenders, her choice anywhere, but left a bad impression here.  They were soaked in oil, microwaved, and didn't look at all appetizing, but we were hungry.  Fries were ok.

I was a regular at Urban Beans. I loved the food, the service, and the beverages. I noticed the staff changing, and the service changing while the coffee bar underwent many changes, and turned into Tertio. 

I went to Tertio a week ago, and I have to say that the food quality isn't quite the same, and the service staff? Some are fine, but there are a few that have obviously never done customer service before. That's putting it lightly.

I am huge on hospitality. I have served plenty of people, and I can understand when people get overwhelmed. I've been there. But when a service staff member does things like, ignores a customer waiting to pay for her order to take out someone's coffee is complete negligence of service. Especially because the other staffer that was there (it was not busy) was simply asking her where the coffee was to go! No, you take care of what is alive and in front of you (payment would have taken 20-30 seconds tops), and then bring out the beverage someone was waiting for anyway.

Seriously. Service is not that hard, people. You would think they'd not want to offer crap service, when an industrious (and usually, quite courteous) Starbucks opened mere steps from their door.

The rest of the menu was not appealing and the place lacked any decor or charm with it's very bright lights and no music.

We arrived around 530 and it was not to busy so we figured that would help us get in and out fairly quickly. No one greeted us so we were kind of lost as to was it open seating or wait to be seated. After a couple minutes of looking lost we were told we could sit any where. A few minutes later I grabbed a couple menus from the counter to see what they had to offer. The waiter did finally show up did not offer any specials or really explain anything. Using a Living Social voucher we each got a glass of wine and a ""melt"" the wine was decent enough. The melt was well strange. It really was just a whole bunch of cheese melted on a doughy flat bread with a few pieces of sausage on it. We did order a couple of other food items as well. The other melt had pear and a balsamic reduction on it. This offered a bit more flavor and was decent enough. We were really looking forward to the baked avocados. Its an avocado split in half and filled with onions and corn and a few other non-descript items. The whole thing was rolled in panko and baked. Well it tasted like exactly what it was named: a baked avocado. No other flavor at all. In fact it was almost bizarre having that warm mushy avocado texture and not much else. Needless to say the whole outing left us disappointed. It's one of those places that online it seems great and then you go there and its nothing like what you expected. It's fine if you do not want a busy place or quick service. But I'd skip it and hit a more well known joint like Postinos."	4.0

Well, there are plenty of other bars that would be happy to take our money so we were going to go to El Hefe instead, No BS at that spot.  However, Matthew did not want to give my wife back her ID.  This is where I got irritated you wasted my time for 10 minutes already, now you're trying to waste another 5 min?  Well I wanted to call the police and get this squared away, we have proof this is her identification and Matthew is clearly an idiot that needs more training.  Then some very tall gargantuan meat head looking fellow starts yelling at the top of his lungs saying we should not be swearing.  Guy, this isnt church, I will say whatever the hell I want especially because your keeping us here wasting our time.  Sigh.

Here is the short version for the nightlife version of the bar. Aesthetically nice. Very expensive drinks. Shit layout. Bouncers will knock you over like a linebacker if they need by to make way for bottle service, to silence a fight, or go get a girls number he's been eyeballing all night. Little to no place to sit or stand unless you have a table.

Here is the short version for the Ohio-backer version of the bar. Same expensive drinks. Nice HD TVs of the game EVERYWHERE. Shit-tons of Ohio Buckeye peeps. Absolutely nowhere to sit or stand unless you got there 3 hours before the game or reserved a table.

Long version for both the above. At night there are a ton of people packed in this place. Which is nice - nobody wants to be in an empty club on Friday or Saturday night. However, it is a legit, straight-up struggle to get anywhere in here... sober or drunk. The place is kind of separated into two bars - one bar kind of outside and the other is inside and lines the dance floor. To go between the two you have to wiggle through a door that is lined and packed with people. To go to the bathroom you at the very least have to struggle through the dance floor, if not through the door and the dance floor. 

The music was good. I like to dance so I was happy to stay on the dance floor and avoid the door. However, I didn't start there and the few times I tried to ""walk a lap"" or go round up a lost friend it was pretty much, as we called it in the military ""nut to butt formation."" The line around the place moved slow and so you were forced to hump the person in front of you and be humped by whoever was behind you. As you can imagine as the night goes on... and the alcohol has been flowing this can be interesting to give and receive. I don't really have a personal bubble (see previous comment about the military) so that didn't really bother me but I'd guess people that have a personal space bubble or claustrophobia might not like this. Oh, and if you don't like drinks spilled on you or knocked out of your hand while walking through, this also might nit be like you. In fact, now that I think about it... it was kind of running a gauntlet with 50 other people where everyone tries to knock you over or knock crap out of your hand as you pass.

This includes the bouncer at the door who feels the need to break up a fight with the other 18 bouncers at the rear of the bar... only he gets the magical authority to hit you like you are a tackle dummy on the ASU practice field. No apologies. Just wear your drink you lil bitch... and enjoy it.

That is a literal true story, BTW.

I have no idea how many times I saw, had friends, or experienced getting hit with drinks in my hand. It was like, cool, I got my drink... and someone would get a signal that they were required to barge down the aisle so that when you turned around they'd hit your drink. Again, no apologies. I also was standing by a table and some guy full force ran and tripped over a step (the tables are elevated) and seriously punched the drink out of my girlfriends hand and let the drink... and glass... rain down on the crowd like some rap video ""making it rain.""

Again, no apologies... much less a ""oh shit, I spilled your drink... I'll buy you a new one."" Good thing my girlfriend is a sport and I'm not a douche and I didn't knock him out.

In any case, it kind of reminds me of a frat party that is trying to be high-class. The place is nice but it turns into a disaster as the night goes on. People seem to have checked their manners at the door.

The other side of this place is that they are an Ohio State Buckeyes backer bar. Like, all the alumni go there... banner hanging outside and everything. Merchandise is sold at the door. This is supposedly one of the bigger Ohio backer bars in Phoenix. And if you don't know, there are a lot of us Buckeyes here in the valley... and yes, they are all there packed in when the Bucks play. But man, it is the same problem as the night story - no room and expensive. With games lasting 3 hours, who wants to stand there? Purely insane people and people with tables, that's who. No thanks for me. I love partying with my fellow Bucks but I like to have an inkling of comfort in doing it. So I went across the street to District and enjoyed the game there... and when Blonde did the songs and chants... I just did it from across the street. I wasn't the only Buck to do the same.

So what is the conclusion on all this? If you want to party... like you're in a frat and on a budget go to Giligins. If you want higher class then go to the District or Hi-Fi. Higher yet, then maybe Mint, Maya, or Cake? If you want to go to a backer bar then I find Buffalo Wild Wings on Gilbert/ Warner to be awesome as it has tables, prizes, and you will still have the same crazy Buckeye atmosphere."	6.0

However, even though we were there in time for both specials the very rude bartender told us because it was final four this weekend that there were no specials so they could make more money. Pretty sure it's illegal to price gouge in AZ. I should have left when she said that. Our meal was mediocre at best.  We ordered a margarita pizza and a mushroom pizza. Both good both not something I would make the trip back for.  The ceasar salad was anything but. We still haven't figured out what the taste was. The croutons on the salad were fluffy bread burnt on a grill. Weird! When the bill came I almost fell over at the price for my Jameson and Ginger.  I'm from So Cal and am used to LA prices but this was seriously inane.  $10.19 for a high ball that tasted like there was maybe 2 drops of whiskey.  My bill even shows that I was charged 3% for what I'm assuming is a fee for using a debit card. This restaurant did have a nice atmosphere but that's about all it had going for it.	0.0

The first time wasn't horrible but the food wasn't great and servers made me feel like I was inconveniencing them every time I asked for another drink or anything at all. Top that off with food that took forever to show up, it shouldn't take that long to throw some cheese on a plate with some toast (I had the burrata) and sauce, and it wasn't even good it was bland.

The second time I came was a disaster. The guy who was serving us was just a rude dick the entire time and was too busy chit chatting with co-workers and watching the games himself to take care of us. This was an early game so I ordered the eggs benedict, while it wasn't bad the fact that it sat for several minutes on the bar while out server was too busy to be bothered to do his job chit chatted away and stared at his female co-workers. Finally one of the women behind the bar saw this and brought us our food.

At the end when I got my bill it noticed extra charges for stuff I never even asked for such as bacon which did show up on my plate but I never asked for it and just assumed it came with breakfast...I know crazy logic jump on my part. There was some other charge as well for something I didn't even get. I just remember this was $3 extra in charges on a $20 bill and while $3 isn't an issue the point was I shouldn't be charged for it. I pointed it out to the server and he went away in huff to look at it. He comes back 5 minutes later and says in a fantastically condescending tone ""So you're arguing over three dollars?"" At which point I tell him yes I am and I never ordered that stuff. He leaves in a huff again and comes back and just drops the revised bill and walks off. I wonder if he got upset about there not being $3 for a tip on there for him.

This place was dropped by the Scottsdale Seahawks group after that game because I wasn't the only one with these issues.

I also questioned why my boots are considered work boots by him and he screamed ""Get the f*&% out of here, its my f*&^ing door so leave"".  Great way to treat locals.

All we wanted to do was enjoy our afternoon, watch the games, and grab some food/drinks.  We sat in a couch area to your right as you walk in....a server came up pretty quickly, but had a horrible attitude.  She was super irritated right off the bat.  She asked how many there was going to be in our group and if we were wanting separate checks.  When we answered yes, her irritation level skyrocketed.  I asked her to just let me know whatever it is she wanted us to do in order to make the process easier, but she just kind of rolled her eyes and never even answered me.  As this was all happening....another member of my group had asked an employee to change one of the tv's that no one was watching (because there were no seats on that side of the bar) to a specific game....and she was told that they couldn't.

After them not being able to change the game (we weren't asking for sound, just for picture...and weren't interrupting anyone else's game) along with the attitude from the server (who I later found out her name was Libby).....we got up to leave.  As we were heading out the door, the bouncer and hostess asked why we were leaving.....in which the bouncer replies that there's no problem in changing the channel.  I still didn't want to go back in, because the server, Libby, was not someone I wanted to give my business to if she wasn't willing to even help us out.

I decided to go back in with the rest of my group and luckily we got a different server...Bui...and she was awesome.  She was nice, helpful, did separate checks for us without an irritated roll of the eyes or comment.....an overall great server with a smile.  I watched Libby continue to serve her other tables, and she never smiled.  Not the type of person I want to have helping me out.

I was visiting some friends in Scottsdale from out of town and after a day of business I attended Bottled Blonde on July 9th 2016. It was a little after midnight and the establishment was extremely overcrowded by the time I got there. I went to purchase some beers at the front entrance and accidentally (because of overcrowding) ended up slightly outside the front door. I was than confronted by the front door bouncer who assault and battered me by grabbing my hand and my personal beers that I just purchased for me and my friend. An altercation occurred and about 5 bouncers took me down to the ground. While I was on the ground they kicked me in my head, ribs, stomach, kidneys, they jumped me like I was a gang member (I am a Tennis Professional). They proceeded to handcuff me and laid me down on my stomach, ""Hog tie"" style. I begged them not to break my shoulder, which one of the bouncers stated, ""I'll break whatever I want"". They physically broke my left foot with their hands. I got a bad concussion, rib contusions and a broken left foot. I ended up suing them in Federal Court for injuring and almost killing me. I missed work and lost out on numerous business opportunities as a result. The city of Scottsdale retaliated (because I also sued them) and filed bogus misdemeanor criminal charges against me in state court. Apparently they tried to file felony charges against me, but the felony charges wouldn't stick, so they settled on misdemeanors. As I've been doing my research I've come to find out that this is standard procedure for not only bottled blonde who injures it's patrons, but police departments and cities like the city of Scottsdale who condone the violence of security guards and collude with local businesses such as bottled blonde in an attempt to stifle anyone who dares to stand up for themselves. I was injured. I lost work. I can't sleep well to this day. And instead of taking responsibility for their actions, they are lying and trying to paint ME to be the bad guy!

Food was great, second waitress was awesome and bartenders were great! But sorry sweetheart. If you don't want to serve us or have an attitude, find a new job or go home for the night. Don't take it out on the customers. Two stars since food was good and eventually the REAL manager took the time to fix the situation."	1.0

She brings us our drinks after another 15 mins, granted they were busy. After a few sips, the doouchebag army of bouncers comes 1 by 1 to each table telling everyone they have to get up because they are getting rid of the tables and chairs to make room for more people to be able to chill and drink. Then they come to us and tell us to get up, i tell them we just ordered food, guy says fine u still gotta get up and we will place u at the next table. The roided up doouchehoves a table in front of a giant 7 foot diamater fan that was blowing super hard. I wish i took a picture to show, but it was ridiculous.  so we got up and refused to sit down 2 feet in front of this tornado. So we get up, some random guy drops off the pizza and calamari at the table and we arent even sitting there. Waitress comes by and we tell her this is BS we already tried cancelling the order, we were forced to get up. Then she brings us our bill and it has the food on there. What kind of service is this? She brought us 2 free beers to make up for the rude treatment we got from the dbag army, not being able to eat our food....but she still expected us to pay for the food. At that moment i got really mad and i said, no way we are paying for thus, left $15 for the 2 drinks and we left. Horrible customer service, dont serve food somewhere with idiot bouncers if u cant treat customers with a little respect.	2.0

He let him buy a shirt and go in no problem  but it was kind of embarrassing  to be treated like that in front of a bunch of people...

I just want everyone to know I had a horrible experience. If I can give it a zero I would. 
  About a year ago I had arrive at a good time to watch a fight on UFC, (6:00 pm)
We had planed to stay there all night if it weren't for that horrible time I had. 
    

     Anyway my night started off like this, it was all four of us. During the night we order pizza and beer and stuff during the fight. Everyone was helping us left and right but did not spot out the waitress all night, i guess she was serving as well. Before the fight ended the bouncer had told us to leave the table, I told him that the fight was not even over and that I still had food on the table. He did not care at all, he told us that the table was reception for some one else..... I was like you should of told us that a long time ago instead of me ordering this food now I'm not going to eat it standing ..... He did not seem to care, as soon as the fight was over the guys took everything, including my beer that was not even finished.. I told the waiter right away what had happen.. She replace my beer right away....
At this moment i was already frustrated and annoyed and angry... Such and      embarrassment...  .. The fight had ended and i was just standing enjoying my beer, when it was time to check out I decided to not give any tips, WHY ..... they took my food, they kicked us out of the table, and left us standing like dogs in the corner. So my friend left her 2 dollars, I was like they don't even deserve a firkin penny!
The waiter came back and asked me as there anything wrong with my service? I said yes so I explain everything to her it seem like she  did not care. She said that was not part of her service.  She said well I don't want your 2 dollars.She threw them on the table where I was leaning against..

A cocktail waitress named Erica who wasn't even our server all night...presented the bill..which was the correct amount and I tipped 20% on 300. She demanded that I tip her on a $600 table....ummm what?? I said very calmly I am sorry but you are mistaken we booked this table at $300 as the bill clearly states. She grabbed my credit card and ID out of my hands and said I am photo copying your ID and CC so we can run this with 20% on $600. I said unfortunately that is against the law Erica...but go ahead and try. Long story short I called the manager and explained what went down... he was mortified. It is absolutely the worst customer service I have ever experienced by this cocktail waitress. She is a liability to this bar as we had a great time up until she came along.

Needless to say, I do not think the bouncers should have a final say on whether or not I'm not allowed in and spend money with you guys.

Unless this matter is resolved, Bottled Blondes will be missing our business, not just mine.

While standing around like fools & telling the bouncer had food coming,the bouncer said he would get us chairs & turn the fan off- it never happened.

To be blown on it, not to mention the cheese on my pizza coagulated within seconds. 10 mins after the food was just laying around . At this point I refused to eat the food & continued to finish my drink & asked for the bill to pay for my drinks. This is quite funny, I get the bill and they had charged me for my the food as well.

I went in with a couple of friends to get drinks a few times, the hosts that were at the front were kinda snotty and stuck up, the guys at the bar didnt look like they were even interested in serving drinks to us or others. We decided to order food, and they werent too bad but like i said before they really need new staff! The waitress that took care of us didnt bother to check up on us, she was snotty and acted cocky. I asked to speak to the manager, she said she would surely get him. We waited 2 hours! No manager, and no waitress!! Really?! I called later that day after we finished and a young lady answered and i asked to speak to a manager she asked what it was regarding, i told her a complaint and 2 minutes after she hung up.

This was what happened: 
It was about 8:30 on Saturday. This was our first stop and the first drink I ordered. We had NOT pre drank. My buddy had purchased a round and the mixed drink he got was beyond weak for $8. 

Then when I asked for a vodka sprite I watched the female bartender put barely a splash of vodka in my drink. The amount was def less than the standard amount. I politely asked her to add more vodka. She accused me of being wasted and told me she was going to charge me $16 dollars for a double if I wanted more vodka added. Her exact words were ""maybe you can't taste the vodka because you are so drunk!"" I clearly wasn't drunk or even buzzed at ALL. I kindly explained to her this was the first drink I ordered. She didn't apologize and caused such a scene that a person standing standing next to me who wasn't even with our group even said something. I couldn't believe she had that audacity to be so rude. 

If I could do it over again I would have talked to a manager right at that moment. 

It would have been different if I was drunk or was being rude, but I was being very sober, kind, and very reasonable."	10.0

However for my halfway to thirty (okay fine, a little closer than halfway) self, I've just well...outgrown it. I would prefer a more mellow place that's not as crowded and loud (god, I can't believe I just said that!). BUT here's how I would party here going forward:

Rather than waiting until 10 or 11 at night, I suggest you roll in after work and grab some pizza, drink and stick around for when it starts getting clubby. By then, you'll have a good buzz going. 

I know what you're thinking, ""Why the harsh two star rating when you've admitted that this place just wasn't your style?"" Here it goes: what really bugged me was that someone shoved my friend out of the way while we were there. I turned around to see what bitch pulled that move and to my extreme horror saw that she was sporting the red hot shorts uniform. IT WAS AN EMPLOYEE!!! WHAT? How rude is that? I mean, I get it, my friend was D-RUNK and probably in her way but still.

A friend who is a woman of color approached security first, showed her ID, and then stepped in the door and to the side to wait for us. I was next in line, and by the time I could say a word to the bouncer he had turned around and was demanding that she leave, saying that she was ""over-intoxicated"" because she did not go straight into the bar once she entered. We all explained that she was simply waiting for us, but he continued to berate her and tell her she was not permitted. We of course all left at that time.

Shortly after, I called in to explain the incident to management. We identified the security guard in question, and I was told by the manager that he would review the security tapes and get back to me. I asked how long this would take, and he immediately got defensive, telling me that they were very busy and he didn't know. I asked if he saw issues such as this as unimportant, and he hung up on me. Another friend soon called in to ask about the incident, only to be told that there were no security guards fitting that description (even though he had just identified him when speaking with me), and again hung up on us. I also called the District Manager afterwards, but have yet to hear back. While all of us thought this was a racist act, I was hoping for another explanation. After a quick search on Facebook, Yelp, and Google however, I found that racism is clearly a persistent problem Bottled Blonde AZ.

The excerpts in the photo are only a portion of the complaints. Any responsible business owner would immediately respond to these comments, and do what they can to correct the situation, but Bottled Blonde has not responded to a single one. This proves that they are complicit and even condoning this bigoted behavior. It is absolutely disgusting that a popular local business can continue to operate on such discriminatory policies. I don't normally get political or opinionated on social media, but when a thriving business is so clearly in the wrong, it would be irresponsible to stay silent. I hope that enough attention can be brought to this issue for a change to be made."	14.0

We came to this right after a concert that was held at live wire.  We got one drink which was way overly priced.

No explanation...nothing...when we asked for an explanation the guy just flashed the flashlight in our eyes and said good night...really?  It was just plain rude...
Wow...there were three of us and one of us had zero to drink...I think we were escorted out due to the fact that we did not meet their age requirements I guess...if that was the case why were we let in the first place?  Why cause a huge scene that was not necessary?? And on top of it rude and un called for?  We were just looking for a spot after the concert to hang for a bit as I know there was other bars around,  but I guess this was not the spot.

There was no wait to be seated, and when we got there, there were a few people at the bar, and a table of around 8 seated.  The place was otherwise empty.  We got there at about 4:25 and were seated by an older woman (fake blonde hair, around her 60's from the look at it)  that was our server said was the hostess.  About 15 min later, my friend inquired (at the bar) if we were supposed to order at the bar, at which she was told no, we should have a server.  Another 10 min went by at which time I approached the older lady and asked her ""do we need to find somewhere else to eat or will someone be serving us within the next couple min?""  She got snappy and said that she would have someone right with us.  Raquel--the server--came by momentarily and took our order.  A couple min later, the older lady came by and asked with an attitude, ""Did your server come over?"" which we replied yes to....as she walked away--with a VERY rude tone, ""then there is no problem!""

The server came by with our drinks and we asked what the older's lady name and if she was the manager.  She informed us that her name was Linda and that she is not the manager but a hostess.  We asked for a manager.  Linda came over in just a few moments and said, ""you asked for a manager?"" When we responded yes, she said she was the manager.  I asked her for a different manager and she said she's the only one on duty.  I told her, ""ok, thank you.  I'll call on Monday and speak to a different manager."" at which point her response was ""If there's a problem, we can ask you to leave now.""  I told her that her attitude was the problem and I will take it up with someone else at another time.  Her next statement was, ""Do you want to eat or not?!""  I advised her we already placed our order.  As she walked away she made another comment, at which point I said ""There's that attitude again!""

The food looked good but had no flavor.  Raquel was wonderful and was on top of it.  We left her a good cash tip since her service was good....it's just too bad she has to work with people like that!"	0.0

We stood at the hostess stand for 5+ minutes, before finally grabbing one of the very busy waitresses who ended up seating us. She was very nice, but you could tell she was in over her head and they were under staffed. She did the best she could, but it shouldn't take over 30 minutes for your food to arrive, especially during lunch. The food was mediocre, nothing to write home about.

I liked the atmosphere a lot. It's more sports related. There's multiple seating on the large patio as well as inside the bar. The bottled beer specials are unbeatable for a downtown bar. Beer, wine, and mixed drinks are 1/2 off. The bottles averaged $2 on happy hour while other bars average $4-$5 for bottles.. Happy hour outside on the patio is 3-6. It's continued to 7pm if you go inside the restaurant. Pricing on bottles is definitely, A+. They have a happy hour food menu with $4 and $5 pricing and a nice selection. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. My experience was completely soured when I ordered the Mexican pizza on the happy hour menu. Mexican pizzas are supposed to be pizzas hence the name pizza. This was a very cheap, flat cheese crisp with limited cheese and jalapenos.It was a cheese crisp at best. It was by far the worse aka Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I immediately complained to the server. I actually told her it was horrific, not a pizza, and the worse example of a Mexican pizza I've ever seen. I told her I wouldn't even feed it to my dogs. She completely agreed!!! She also said it looked horrible and wasn't worth eating!!! YET, there was no offer to comp it off my bill or bring the manager over. I told her to tell the cook it was awful. She just kept agreeing. I didn't get compensated for it, no apology, just nothing. I left the entire thing sitting on the table. If you're looking for cheap bottled beer, a pretty cool atmosphere, and easy parking, this is your place. I couldn't rate it a 1 star because of the other perks. Not comping me and agreeing how horrible the food was is unacceptable.	1.0

A silent spoken man walked up to the bar area to ""Kathy"" asking if she could get his server so they could check out.

First I was ignored for a good 20 minutes after being seated. A manager saw me being kinda ignored and got the drink.  Later had to specially ask for water (I had requested it but it was forgotten).

Then to the entree.  I needed fairly healthy and plain (not fried).  So even though I'm a burgers and wings kinda guy, I opted for the grilled tilapia entree with red potato.  My server talked me out of the potato and said that the sliced version was tasty but not greasy.  She insisted I wasn't entitled to a dinner roll or a choice of soup or side salad as the menu stated.

A tilapia sandwich arrived, clearly with the plain fish and fixins on an open bun. The sliced potatoes were fried like french fries, draped in grease. I questioned this to my server and she insisted that this was indeed the entree.  When the manager was roving around, she asked me if there was an issue and I explained.  She shook her head, apologized (server is newer) and offered to get me the entree with salad.  Super nice lady, I can tell she was juggling lots.

Then the server came over (while redo was in the works) and said she was sorry and how come I didn't let her know there was an issue.  Yes, I did, at ordering the entree (wasn't this to include soup or salad etc) and upon arrival (hey this looks like a sandwich, not an entree). Incredible.

So the meal arrives and the fish, instead of tender and soft like the sandwich version, is close to a chew toy in terms of being overcooked.  I mean, really.

The final perplexing aspect is when I ordered a turkey wrap to go.  I specifically asked that the wrap not be heavy in dressing. The server told me that dressing came on the side; I reiterated how I was ill and needed no/little oil in the wrap. Of course, the wrap I received was lathered on dressing.  Lathered, saturated.

To recap, slow indifferent service unless a manager notices.  Servers who don't know their own menu and take no initiative to verify what the customer will receive. And oh by the way, when I returned to my hotel afterwards, I lost my lunch in its entirety.

Maybe this place would be great if just ordering burgers and fries during a non-busy time of year and from a knowledgeable server.  But this was my experience."	2.0

Also, had the pleasure of sitting next to an individual who was in need of a bath.  After trying to be nice to this individual since he was starring at us for a few minutes, we said, ""hello"" and we were met with a ""grrrrr"" for a response.

Walk in and the place is packed - much to be expected during Phoenix Comicon. Menu selection wasn't the best, but I ordered anyway because I was hungry and my boyfriend picked the place. Took a while to get our food - understandable due to Phoenix Comicon. When we get our food, DISGUSTING. 

I have never, in my 23 years of life, had to salt  burger I've ordered from a restaurant. I ordered a medium burger, got something that was thrown on the grill for 10 seconds on each side. I ate it thinking it was just me being picky but it really was undercooked and gross. The Jalapeños were the only thing keeping me eating the damn burger, and throwing salt and their salsa on it. Fries were just a hard pile of grease.

While we were trying our best to eat this stuff, I notice the wait staff hanging in their corner all at the exact same time, not tending to any tables. I let the eating food in the corner slide because I figured they had been busting their asses all day busy with convention goers, but they just stood their chattering for about 10 minutes when they could be wiping tables or clearing tables or whatever. They were just plain lazy, all except for the guy with the camo avengers shirt and the dish bucket.

Our table was so full and cluttered with useless crap that didn't need to be there. There was barely enough space for our food on the table.

They didn't ask us whether we wanted a booth or table. The regular tables were uncomfortable, YET I was in a seat that faced an empty booth that looked much more comfortable. Would've been nice to know my options.

Huge group of kids show up and they're screaming their heads off all hyper and stuff. Which I understand, BUT do you seriously have to yell, ""WHO WANTS BURGERS? WHO WANTS SPAGHETTI?, Just ask the kids individually and treat them like a normal person. This isn't a damn school field trip and it was very annoying for everyone else in the restaurant, not just me.

After we tried to digest the meal we just had, I wanted to be far away from that place as possible. Get to our hotel room and, just my luck, FOOD POSIONING.

Most of us already know this is not the best place downtown to eat, but its late. Venture in at 10:34, very not busy at all. So we get drinks, a few just get water and a couple cups of coffee. Now 11:10 ish, we have been talking to another server who is not our server about events around the convention, wondering if he has seen our server, people want a refill on drinks, questions about where the food is. 11:17 or so the server we had been speaking to gets the manager for us and begins telling us how busy they are. Actually, the entire inside is a ghost town, they are still seating what few people are walking up on the patio. As my friend Ryan is dicussing what is going on with the manager, the onion rings arrive almost an hour after we were seated. Like four people reach for one at the same time, not even hot, as we get up to leave, the balls displayed by this manager asking if we were gonna pay for the drinks was just astounding.	3.0

We ordered food and drinks and were enjoying ourselves until the resident street people came around ...along with the owners.  As the woman owner walked in she appeared to try and become confrontational with us but then went inside.  Just after that, our party was told we wouldn't be served anymore and were cut off.  After we explained that none of us were driving they graciously let us stay for a brownie with a candle in it. We were then told we had to leave after I went in to talk to the waitress and the male owner tried to stop and listen to what I was saying to her which made me stop talking until he walked away.  That's when we were cut off.  It was a clear and vulgar display of power. It seemed as though the owners bought a bar so that they and their friends could drink.  I can see now why it was empty.

It was a little suspicious since all other restaurants were crammed and there was barely anyone here, but I was getting hangry so we decided to stop in. 

There was live music and we ate outside, which wasn't terrible. The menu was a bit confusing - you could get a burger or pizza which is expected for a grill, but they also had a few surprising items like chicken biryani that sprinkled the menu. I was craving pizza so that's what I ordered while my coworkers ordered burgers. 

We also got the appetizer sampler, which was pretty good but it's hard to mess up fried food. When my pizza came, after one look I was no longer hungry. I ate about two slices and was done - it tasted maybe like a lunchables pizza that was microwaved.

It has been a few months since our last visit and today we decided to go back so that we could take my cousin and her boyfriend to our fave spot.  My husband and I were excited taste their yummy wings.  However, that excitement quickly became a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! 

Let me start off by saying that the waitress and food from today really sucked!  First, we ordered drinks and they took forever to come back even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  Then, we ordered wings, the chicken tenderloins, and a burger w/ fries. These didn't take that long but when they came out I thought that something was off. The wings were served in a silver bowl where the wings are tossed, which I have NEVER EVER seen done in my visits to this place. No presentation, everything was just blah.... I went ahead and tried them expecting great taste as always but INSTEAD they tasted old and not cooked correctly. They had a very chewy consistency. We normally chow these down but based on how horrible they were my husband did NOT even eat!!  I left most of the wings as well!! And moving on to the tenderloins... I don't know what is going on at Steve's but whatever it is, it's not good!!! The tenderloins looked like they were popped out of a frozen bag and thrown into the fryer. They were chewy and felt hard on the outside! Nothing fresh about them, PLUS THEY TASTED LIKE FISH completely gross!!! Someone is using oil to fry fish and then using it to fry other foods which is totally disgusting!!!!!  The fries that came with the burger tasted just like FISH as well! All of it just totally killed my appetite and we did not even say anything to the waitress because we wanted to get out of there and not make a scene.

I will NOT GO BACK AT ALL!!  I was so disappointed by my experience at Steve's today. I don't know who the person is that is in charge is right now but all I can say is that they're doing a horrible job and killing this place!  In my past visits, the owner: an anglo, short chubby lady with short blonde hair was there and the restaurant was doing well but now it just seems to have GONE TO THE DUMPS!! I wasted my money today but that is ok, at least now I know not to go back and to tell others not to waste their money at this place."	0.0

It was expired and sour smelling....even had brown foam on top! Conveniently the part of the label with the expiration date on it was missing. I refused to touch anything else. Twice the waiter walked by...never asked how food was or acknowledged us. When he finally came to see if we were done he asked if I needed a box....told him vinegar was expired...he smelled it...made a face and agreed. I told him to take my food off of the bill....I didn't eat ok. No apology...and nothing...walked away! Came back with our check...said nothing and walked away! Unbelievable! My daughters food and my husbands food was cold and tasted to them like it had been sitting around a long time..I don't doubt it. My daughter tried bathroom...dirty...small and couldn't turn the water on to wash her hands! We will not be back and I sure hope....if you're reading this....you don't try it either.

My boyfriend's drink also came in a airplane glass (same size you get for those of you that fly) and it costed $5.50 for well-gin and sprite, really? Plus, while waiting for our dishes, he brought us two of the wrong ones and we had to tell him it wasn't ours. Never had a ""sorry"" come out of his mouth about anything.

Fast forward to now and the place has gone downhill steadily. Service got slower. People got angrier. Average food became bad food because everything else was negative. The only positive I can give about this place is that you get a chair to sit in to relax a little after walking all day. 

I can't say anything negative about the manager as I never had to deal with him and most times, the servers were good to me. I seem to be one of the luckier ones in this regard though.

This place is so very amazingly and exceptionally average. As in like, my stomach was full but not because the food was so good I couldn't help but to eat every last bite, as much it was because I only had an hour for
lunch. Wife ordered a ""tortilla soup"" and some type of healthy rice and grilled veggie meal. The soup was barely edible (salty, over spiced and FULL of corn) and the rice was reheated from cold storage and the grilled veggies were soggy. My Reuben was edible. That's about where that stops but for full disclosure purposes, I'm a bit of a Reuben snob. (See former reviews of the Reuben at Windsor) My daughters burger was meh. Fries and tater toys were deep fried in the same grease that was not only old and badly needed to be changed but also used to fry the fish they were serving for the fish and chips. Gross!! Fishy tasting fries! 
 
Service was below average. Waitress not only had a huge case of the ""idontgivadamns"" but wasn't anywhere to be found except to drop off food and take Initial order.  Decor was dated.

Then, it was barely edible, and my friend ate only a few bites of it .  I ordered the caesar salad with steak, dressing on the side.  The server brought me a caesar salad with dressing mixed in, and without the steak.  Five minutes later, he brought the steak in a bowl, looking very unappetizing.  It was o.k., and I ate it.

It came with two spiceless spicy cajun onion rings and 'eh' enchilada soup of the day. Service was good & the price was right $20.00 with tip but the food & ambiance was lacking.

Not bad but it got much worse from the on.   After another 15 minutes drinks were finally delivered. The problem was we ordered vodka tonics and received vodka and cranberry juice.  We stated that was not out order and they took them back to get the correct drinks.  15 minutes later still no drinks.  We are at a total of about 35 minutes now waiting on drinks.  My friend finally walked to the bar to see about the drinks.  The bar tender was extremely rude saying oh you mean the vodka cranberry drinks I made.  She explained that wasn't what we ordered and he decided to make the correct drinks.  Now that we finally got drinks another 20 minutes passed and we still don't have food. Mind you the table behind us placed there order after we did and they have received there food and are finished by this time.   We have been there almost a hour by now.  I complained to the waiter letting him know we needed to be at a concert said he could just bring us our check for the drinks.  Totally shocked I said you are really charging is for drinks that we waited 35 minutes for and had to get ourselves.  He said he would send a manager over.  Manager was useless, just didn't want us to leave on our food order.  Surprisingly food arrives soon after the manager walked over - we order flatbread that was cold and tasteless.  It was awful!   We asked for the bill and we were being charged for everything.  No attempt at making up for their horrible service at all.   The manager finally took 1 drink off the bill - very big of him!   I guess when your restaurant is this bad you are used to people complaining.  I would give zero stars if possible.	1.0

We ate here last year and were unimpressed but figured we would give them the benefit of the doubt and another try...big mistake!!! We stood outside waiting to be seated for forever and  were finally greeted ( and I used the term lightly)by some sour faced hostess that seemed to hate her job... maybe even her life.  Another long wait and our server showed up... the food did come out quickly... but how long does soup and salad take.  But after that he pretty much disappeared.... We sat there for the better part of 30 minutes ...totally finished eating, just hanging out for our check. We were seated outside and saw several groups of people just walk away because they were tired of standing there waiting to be seated. I would understand if the place was busy but it is far from it...its too bad because we do a lot of work at symphony hall and would frequent this place because its convenient...but I think I've had my final bad experience	0.0

It looked it it was going to be a bad lunch when I ordered an arnold palmer and it came out and tasted like tea and water, none of the sweetness of the lemonade, luckily I was able to swap it out for a coke. We asked about the beer specials and our waiter couldn't remember, but stood there for a while trying to, but then gave up.The drunken chicken sandwich was slathered in buffalo sauce instead of the chipotle remoulade which I ordered. The chipotle mac and cheese which was described as penne, came out as spaghetti. When we asked about silverware we were directed to the jars full of knives and forks but no spoons. Storing silverware on the table is disgusting, who knows what was done to it before we sat down. We sat for a while waiting for our check before finally having to ask someone to send our waiter back with it.	0.0

My friend and I were looking for a pretty cheap place to eat downtown in between some meetings. We had a few hours to kill and didn't want to grab anything quick (like jimmy johns or chick fil e) just something affordable. We found this spot and decided to check it out.

When we first got there the hostess asked if we wanted to sit in or outside. Not really sure ourselves we talked for maybe just ten seconds and then she made the decision for us. No one else was waiting in line ..   Luckily it turned out ok to sit outside, but I was not a fan of her abruptness. 

From there it took about 15 minutes for our server to get to us. Luckily another one who was working outside and grabbed us some drinks. I was surprised that we got our food in a timely fashion and that it was still hot.

I ordered a turkey burger and my friend had a regular burger. I fell in love with the food. It was just the kind of bar food I was expecting too. Big and greasy. So my cravings where definitely satisfied as where my friend's.

The disappointment with service continued though. Our server offered us condiments to dress our burgers when she dropped them off, but we never saw her until we were basically done our meal. So of course we grabbed some ketchup from an abandoned table. She first took my plate since my friend was still working but then didn't show up again until 12 minutes later with the check. Never asking us if we wanted drink refills or anything else to eat. Then another 8 minutes to grab the bill and another 6 to check us out. 

Mind you it was well staffed and not very busy, yet we were there for 1.5 hours instead of a comfortable 40 minute meal."	3.0

The waiter was slow, ungracious ( no please or thank you even), incompetent ( waited for food to chill before bringing out flatware), and when asked about an error on the check, downright rude.
Waiter is evidently part of the ""family business"" judging by the resemblance to the even ruder guy in charge, who came out to verify the error. ((He had a special posted on the promo chalkboard he was refusing to recognize.) He acted as if we had insulted them by asking for a corrected bill...and after a few words to point out the mistake, to emphasize how little our money meant to him, instead of re-ringing us, he took a big, grubby roll of small bills out of his pocket and counted out the credit onto a nearby table, right down to the dime. His rudeness and hostility was incredible! He made sure we knew how inconsequential our small party was to him.

It was another 10 minutes before our partial & incorrect drinks were brought out then another 5 to correct it. We were told 4 times that our food was coming right up which turned out to be almost an hour. At first they brought out only 3 of our 6 plates (none of which were for the 3 hungry & cranky kids). It took almost 10 more minutes to bring out the next 2 plates followed by another 5 minute wait for the 5 y/o's plate (who was darn near in tears because she was so hungry). You'd think after taking that long the orders would at least be correct, right? Nope, 2 of them were wrong... On top of all this, they completely forgot about our appetizers we ordered until we were pretty much done with the food. It seems like this place is severely understaffed but the host blamed it on the waiter & the waiter on the kitchen. All in all, unless that place hires more or better staff, we will never be returning (which is sad being as the food was pretty darn good). So if you have children or are hungry, stay away!	1.0

This was my 2nd visit to this restaurant; I was hoping my first experience was maybe that we just caught them on a bad day. 
To start out, the hostess told us there were no seats inside, that the inside tables were only for large parties so we had to sit outside (it was 108 and smelled like nasty beer and mildew). We decided to sit anyway mainly because all the other restaurants near by were packed. Then literally right after she seated us we watched her seat 2 other separate parties of 2 INSIDE! 
The tables were dirty, my arms stuck to ours. The glass O' silverware and the salt and pepper shakers were filthy! Like a layer of grey dirt on them. Then it took 20 minutes for anyone to even acknowledge we were sitting there, I asked the people at the table next to us who the server was and when I asked the girl she states she's not our server and walks back INSIDE! Finally a girl comes to take our drink orders. I wanted to order everything right away because I was afraid nobody would come back (this happened my 1st time visiting as well) and the girl tells me she's not our server either! Seriously?? So we get our drinks, The beer was warm, had a weird odor and had a soured taste. It was bad. I'm guessing their kegs aren't being stored at the correct temperature. So our waitress finally comes out, she was very nice but she disappeared a lot and we had to wait a long time to get beer refills. I found out later that our waitress had been going to stand in the walk in cooler in between checking on the tables (she actually told us this). We got our food after what felt like forever and it was nothing special, not enough seasoning and my tater tots also had onion rings and French fries in it which I'm guessing is because they don't clean their deep fryer.
Overall, this place is bad :( I will never go back and I will make sure to let everyone I know not to eat there either."	3.0

***TL;DR Version: If you're near the con today, be wary about eating at Steve's Greenhouse Grill. Tony, one of the managers, is completely oblivious to good customer service. One of the servers even said this. I'm not a scene-causing person and he pissed me off enough to do it.***

Anyone who knows me, knows that it takes a lot to make me angry. I try to be very understanding with people in the service industry. I'm not a big ""let me speak to the manager"" type of person, unless it's absolutely necessary. Last night, after PCC, I hung out with my friends at Steve's Greenhouse Grill (across the street from Networks). Service was painfully slow, but I chalked that up to being busy with the con crowd. At the end of the night, my bill was $7 more than it should've been. Turns out they gave us an old menu, with old drink prices. We asked to speak to the manager, which made the servers oddly uncomfortable. When I brought this up to Tony, the manager, he decided to fight me on it. ""It was an honest mistake that we left that menu on your table, but that's what the prices are. It's still cheaper than everywhere else around here."" After telling him that wasn't the point, he took my receipt to ""correct"" it. He docked $3. After asking him what that was about, he says ""I gave you a discount. So, we're good? Are you gonna come back?"" Which was a weird thing to ask. I objected and told him that he should honor the prices on the menu given to us. He took my receipt and ""corrected"" it again. He took the discount off and put the original overcharged price back on. I was pissed. He then said to me ""Well, I tried to help you, and you didn't like it, so now you have to pay the whole bill."" At this point, it was beyond about being overcharged. I may have thrown a few, or a lot of profanities at this guy. One of the servers tried to diffuse the situation by offering me $7 of her own tips, which I refused. The other servers even whispered to me ""just go,"" encouraging me to skip out on the bill. They obviously disliked this manager. I told them that I wanted to take care of the bill with the owner, when she came in the next day. What ended up happening, was an off-duty manager was sympathetic to my situation, so he went and told Tony to take the $7 off. After paying the bill, Tony borderline sarcastically says ""I apologize. Have a nice night,"" to which I sarcastically responded ""You too!"" In typical Comic Book Guy delivery: Worst. Manager. Ever."	3.0

We waited for about 10 minutes to be seated, puzzled... the place was still pretty much empty!  A massive line did form behind us however. Finally when we were sat, we continued to sit there looking cool for another 25 minutes before even being served. Let me tell you how uncomfortable it is to have a table full of hungry, irritated, picky, rushed, short fused pirates. Eagerly barking out food orders to this poor waitress, we noticed a horrible confusion happening with the humongous line that had formed.

White chicken chili did not reveal any signs of chicken.  Spiceness added to make up for the lack of flavor.

Food came about 20 minutes later and was very good.  waitress checked in on us once then we had to flag her down to get our check quite a while later.  we asked her to split my beer and salad & friend's beer and wings on our cards.  although the wings are listed on the HH menu, and waitress knew we were there ordering for HH, wings were billed at full price.  Flagged down to ask about this and she said ""the wings are not on happy hour.""  ????  um, yes they are, and again she repeats that they are not, regardless that it's written in black & white on the menu.  she gives us no explanation, just that they're not on happy hour.  then she got irritated we didn't understand this.  she said she meant to tell us this but kept forgetting.  apparently the wings, although again, on the HH menu, are NOT on HH on game nights.  this is mentioned no where, written no where, and was not told to us when we ordered.  fail fail fail.  the waitress was unapologetic, abrupt with us, unwaivering, and didn't give a crap that this was on her to mention from the get-go, not once we get the bill and have to ask about it.  between her shitty attitude, crappy customer service, and the 'customer should know what's on the HH menu and what's not, regardless of what's actually written on the HH menu' policy, there is no need for me to patronize this place again.   too bad, because the guitarest was awesome.
i know it's not a huge deal, but the waitress handled this completely wrong, knew it, and did nothing to remedy and learn from it.  i was a waitress for a long time; takes A LOT for me to leave a crappy tip.  this gal got a $2 tip for her efforts.  maybe that'll get her attention."	0.0

I noticed the bleu cheese was almost non existent as far as taste, way too little of it after opening my burger up to see what's going on. The fact that there were two patties made it impossible to taste it, once I removed a patty, I could taste it a little more. 

We ordered our burgers cooked medium, they came to us well done. It wasn't as dry as you'd expect being that thoroughly cooked, so that was nice. I just ate my burger anyway because I was hungry as hell, and it took quite a while to get to us... I wasn't about to wait any longer. Apparently the waiter didn't put our ticket up for the cook and forgot about it for a little while. We were able to see that from where we were sitting.

The fries were ok as well, not great but not bad either. 


It's been a long ass time since I've ordered anything but water at a restaurant, so I was kind of surprised at $5.00 for two iced teas. 

Other than forgetting about our ticket, our waiter did a pretty decent job. Neither of our drinks bottomed out, and he checked up on us fairly often.

Unfortunately, tonight was a huge let down. Although a couple important games were on, we were seated immediately since many tables were available. For a table of 6, we were given 1 menu and no silverware/napkins. We started by ordering drinks and food immediately. Drinks took 15 minutes, which is somewhat understandable due to the the amount of people at the bar. However, food took 55 minutes to come to our table and we were rarely visited by a waitress. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 slices of pizza, and a burger. Bringing out appetizers after almost an hour is unacceptable. Our checks were not split up after requesting multiple checks and we had to reiterate our orders to the waitress since it was not originally noted what each of us ordered. After speaking with the manager, he explained they were understaffed and offered an apology. We were also given a generous discount on each meal which we were more than thankful for.

There is too much competition in the area for hiring people who have no clue about customer service. I won't go back after too many chances with this place.	0.0

It was a simple chicken fingers with a side of onion rings. They said it would be done in 20 minutes. I got there at the 20 minute mark and still had to wait. Once I got back to work with my food, I seen that they had put regular fries instead of onion rings... I couldn't go back to correct the order because my lunch is only a half hour...	1.0

I do understand if it's really busy, and she is busting her rear end to satisfy everyone. but the thing is she didn't have many tables to attend to. it then took about an hour to get our food (strips and wings) I know that isn't her fault so I'm not blaming her on that.. the food was good, but to top it all off. we waited another twenty minutes for the waitress to pick our tabs up.. so honestly, the service was just very bad..."	1.0

So we get here at like 11:30 last night and i ask for a cup of coffee. This server straight said no. That she would not brew a pot of coffee for just one person. Ok fine... Can i have hot tea... Again i was denied... So fine i just won't have anything to drink with my meal. My boyfriend ordered an ice tea and it was cloudy and stale. It was far too old to be offering to a customer. Ok that was strikes1-3. Then we order or food. 20 minutes later when it finally shows up EVERYTHING was cold because this ""server"" left it sitting under a heat lamp. Cheese on nachos was cold and hard and my fries were so stale that they were nit edible. So we sent our food back along with three other tables around us. So... My boyfriends food comes back out and i wait another 5 minutes for my food. Now mind you the other 3 tables had already gotten their food. So as i sit and wait i ask to speak with the manager. Anthony come out and he is mortified at the lack of customer service and respect. He comps our food for us which was very nice of him. BUT!!!  When i finally get my food its not right and i ask the server why there was no bacon on my sandwhich... She states the club sandwich does not come with bacon. Ok wait then why did the first one have bacon? She wouldnt bring me a menu so i pull it up online. Sure enough... Theres bacon on a club... So i speak with Anthony again and he is dumbfounded.so his server is useless and just didnt want to do her job and his kitchen staff doesnt know how to make a basic club sandwich and nachos??? This was the most pathetic experience ive had in a restraunt in a VERY LONG TIME. Poor Anthony asked us to give them another chance but why in the world would anyone ever lower their standards and return to a restraunt that is lacking in leadership and professionalism? Your better off buying a 6 pack and grabbing McDonalds at this point... If you want a real good experience go to the one on union hills. You wont be disappointed...

Now there is a new manager with a ""seating policy.""  That meant that if you aren't young and hip looking, you are told that they don't have any tables for two.  Same thing happened to the two people checking in right in front of us.  The hostess was very rude to them so I tried to be extra nice so I wouldn't get treated like that.  Didn't help.

The manager was a total jerk about everything.  There were plenty of open tables, but they were ""saving them for more than two people.""  It was 5:50 pm. That's when a young couple with a baby came in long after us, and they sat them at an empty table right away.   We were told by Cesar Rodriquez, the GM, that they were a ""party of 3"" so they got seated.  We looked around the restaurant, and just about every 4-top table or booth had 2 people at it.

Last night about 10 of my fellow teacher friends and I went to Happy Hour at Zipps on 16th St and Bethany to relax after a long week. Unfortunately it turned into a great night gone bad. We were there over 5 hours enjoying ourselves....the food and drinks were great. Then we went to pay our bills. This is where everything went down hill quickly. They don't keep track of who gets what. One of our friends had ordered 2 Zipparitas at the bar and 1 at our table. He paid for the 2 at the bar beforehand. At the end of the night they tried charging him for 2 at the table. He only ordered 1 at the table. This was a $4 Zipparita mind you. Instead of just saying ""I'm sorry I got it wrong"" and taking it off they proceeded to argue and THEN called the cops on us for a $4 drink. We could've easily paid the $4 and left but it was the principle of being charged for a drink we didn't order. One of our other teachers ended up giving them a $5 bill to cover the charge but they still wouldn't bring us the bill until the cops showed up. Apparently the cops get called to this location all the time over stupid issues like this. It's one thing if a fight broke out or if we all didn't pay our bills but it was over a $4 drink. I would much rather have our police going after the more serious crimes than over a $4 drink. But that's ZIPPS for ya.

A manager should know how to talk to people and solve an issue so that patrons come back, not challenge them to call corporate.

My wife's cup of chili was supposed to be ""spicy"", but was neither spicy nor hot, as in temperature.  Her fries also seemed to suffer from being scraped from the bottom of the pile.

Next is the noise.  I know its a sports bar and it's going to get noisy, but why play loud rock music on top of that?  We couldn't hear ourselves think and when we asked for the music to be turned down they did it, but only for about five minutes.  There were about six couples at tables, and another dozen or so at the bar, and nobody was watching the games or, it seemed, listening to the music.  

Lastly, no Wi-Fi.  What's up with that?  I asked and they said it's because they don't want people ""camping out"".  People camp out in a sports bar?  Really?

On Thursday last week, we ordered take out from Zipps. When we got home, they had gotten our order wrong. We called to let them know, and since I'm 9 months pregnant, I'm not really interested in having to drive all the way back to the restaurant for them to give us the right food. We asked for a refund, but they said their POS system doesn't allow them to give refunds so instead we could get ""Zipps Bucks"" to use on a future order. Ok, fine, whatever.

Fast forward to Sunday. We ordered 3 bowls of chili to go, and when we got home with them, each one was only half full. Again, I called and said at this point two mess ups in a matter of days was unacceptable and asked for a refund again. The manager gave me the phone number of their corporate office and said that Tiffany would be able to help with the matter. I called Tiffany this morning and told her the story, so she told me she would ""research"" the incident with her ops team and get back to me. She called me several hours later to tell me that since we had eaten the chili, they were not going to give us a refund. She also said that they did in fact give us the correct amount of chili for our order, but the cups they serve it in are just oversized. I told her that every single week when I order chili from other Zipps locations, the same cup is filled to near the top. She said those other locations were clearly doing it wrong and she was still not going to give us a refund (oh, btw the chili costs $5 per bowl, so this is a refusal of a refund of $15 for a customer who spends over $1500 per year at their establishment...)

Want to know the best part? Tiffany told me over the phone that she is the Director of their corporate office, so there's no sense in me talking to her boss (the owner) because he sides with her and this was their decision together. Guess what her title actually is? Director of Marketing and Public Relations... Interesting way to treat a customer when you're in charge of PR...

It's a shame. Zipps is one of our favorite places to go. But the fact that their customer service is living in an alternate reality where a justifiably upset customer gets treated like garbage is really not a solid way to run a business. Hence why almost all of their locations are rated 3 stars or lower on Yelp.

So we walked in and sat down in the BAR area. I requested to have one of the TVs changed to the UFC fight that was already playing on a different TV but we could not see very well to start with. So as the waitress walks away she comes back with who I assume was the manager I am not sure because he didn't even approach us directly or even speak straight to us but he sure did speak loud enough for us to hear. He said ""we don't show the UFC fights, in fact I'm going to change that channel right now"" I was appalled! I couldn't believe that he just said that. Luckily we hadn't even ordered anything yet so we got up and walked out (I was actually looking forward on trying their wings) 

Unbelievable! Your name has SPORTS in it! So Zipps doesn't consider UFC a sport?! Honestly I felt like I was being discriminated.

I was denied seating at the only available table, a six top, because my party of two was not large enough (they were full, but no waiting list). The hostess asked if I could ""get more people?"". She said I could sit in the bar which was overfilled or the patio instead. 
I said no to the patio and said I would be happy to sit at the bar if she could find seating for us (there was none). She stared at me blankly, confusion. I then asked if we should leave instead of being seated at the available table, response was silence. Just a blank stare. We turned and left.
As we drove off to find another sports bar I decided to call and let a manager know that I was displeased. I called and spoke to Jason. Jason said he heard the entire exchange and that it was my fault because I didn't give them a chance. 
I assume Jason is one of the owners children, no other explanation for someone that inept hanging on to a management position anywhere. My wife, son and I will no longer be seen at Zipp's. Way to go Jason!

Side note-
Zipps- Please listen- your patio is a nasty smoke hole. No one that isn't smoking or with a smoker would sit out there. I would love to kick it on the patio when the weather is nice, but you've sold the entire space to smokers, so not very friendly to anyone else out there.

After 20 minutes of talking to various managers, who claim to have surveillance video of this non-existant drink, we offered to just pay for it so we could leave. They held our bill until after the cops arrived hoping we would leave without paying for anything. The cops were awesome and said they get called to Zipps (all locations) a lot over things like this.

The wings were excellent as always!  Yet the service was atrocious.  Our waitress came and brought me a bill with an extra drink I did not purchase.  Easy fix right?  No, that wasn't the case.  A manager (Louie) I think told me I would have to pay the bill for the extra drink since he claimed it hit the table, and it was on my bill.  Apparently he claimed another girl ordered the drink and said it was ok to put on my bill. ???  Well, it appears that is common practice because another patron in our group said it happened on another occasion.  Since it was happy hour, it was an extra $4 charge, no big deal.  However, based on principle alone, I shouldn't be accountable for someone else's drink.  So this manager said he would call the police if I did not pay the additional charge.  He did.  He refused to bring the bill until the dispute was solved.  I was avoided for 20 minutes, and most of the group stayed back with me to resolve the situation.  It was $4, lol. No big deal, someone else thought it wasn't worth the stress and forked over $5 to cover the drink.  While the police were there to monitor the situation Miranda came over to say she was sorry for the inconvenience, and it was beyond her control . I explained that we were waiting for a lengthy amount of time, and this extra charge would affect her tip.  She mouthed off something along the lines it wasn't her fault, but she was my waitress.  Why was this acceptable?   On stress alone and the risk of alienating all patrons who visited with me $4 was a risk this establishment was willing to fight.  As we exited the manager who called the police was conversing with them by the door.  The police followed us out.

  It became harassment when we all exited and as I sat in my car getting ready to drive away, a police officer who was there insisted I call for a ride, or an uber.  He asked me if I started the car.  He also said because he was nice he could have waited for me to drive away before pulling me over.  WTF.  Without probable cause other than leaving a sports bar, I was accosted.  Clearly rational and sober I walked over to Starbucks on an adjacent block.  It was $4, I sit here 40 minutes later clearly writing this review.  3 Phoenix Police cruisers have driven by since.  2 police officers stopped in and purchased coffee.  I took it upon myself to offer to buy their drink, and possibly ask questions about the legal limit in AZ.  I had two drinks, and they stated it affects each person differently, and advised me to drink some water before driving off to help clear the system just in case.  I think I'll stay here for another hour or so before heading home, and get some work completed.  Yet, I somehow feel disappointed with how our tax dollars are spent.  We were there to have a good time after a long day.  And we were there without incident for 2 hours.  No food is worth the price of harassment and intimidation regardless of quality.  BEWARE of extra charges on your bills, and have some dignity.

AVOID AVOID AVOID THIS LOCATION.  There are many other Zipps locations that offer superior customer service and management.  But, I must say Buffalo Wild Wings, Long Wongs, and even Applebee's would never have treated us this way.  Disappointed long time customer.

My friend ordered wings when our waitress came back and I told her that I was going to order food as well. While she knows that the kitchen closes at 12 she didn't bother to let me know that the kitchen would be closing at that time. No warning whatsoever. As a server I know that that is common courtesy. I am a waitress/ bartender so I know how the restaurant business works. Then, my friends wings come out around 12:05 and I ask our waitress what time the kitchen closes and she says it is too late to order because they close the kitchen at 12.

The burgers are odd because the meat is actually pretty good but its put in this cheap mcdonald's like bun and all you get is a couple slices of red onion.  First of all, why would you want 2 slices of red onion and what about the usual lettuce and tomato?  Pickle anyone?  The fries are like In and outs of Phoenix area - dry, dark, and shrivelled.  The onion rings are like plump versions of French's onions, the things you put on top of green bean casseroles.

We ordered 2 Bloody Mary's, 1 with extra olives, an order of wings, 1 house salad and a club sandwich.  Our Bloody Mary's were soooo bad. About the most generic I've ever had.  I was also told by my server that she had been told by the manager at the bar that I could not have extra olives as they were expensive and I would be charged $.75 for every 3 olives in my Bloody Mary.  About 20 minutes later my husband's house salad came. 10 minutes after that my sandwich came....then we stared at our food for another 20 minutes until the wings came out.  Our server was great. Very professional and sweet.  Unfortunately, the kitchen and bar were not making life easy for the servers. So...I'd say don't EVER get a Bloody Mary from Zipps unless you BYOO (bring your own olives.) And don't expect to get your food in a timely manner or to get your orders together. Zipp's....the food was pretty good. But the experience was long and drawn out.  And I've never ever EVER been charged for olives.

This place has certainly gone down hill from when they first opened up so my suggestions are this...#1. When there are sporting events going on, get more help #2. I love that the staff likes each other, however, dont use work as your social outlet. Hugging and chit chatting are best left to off hours. #3 Management needs to step up and do that. Manage. #4. I can get ignored at the best of places. I certainly would not go out of my way to do it here. Service is priority - that is why people go out and spend their money! #5. Get the good food back.

She seemed a bit overwhelmed but didn't think much of it. Ten minutes later we ordered, two orders of wings and a house salad to come out before. Twenty minutes later I asked our server if my salad was going n the way, in which she responded I don't know. She went on to say this is how it works. We ring in the tickets and they make them in order....weird she found it necessary to explain this to me. A few minutes goes by and she drops the salad off and keeps walking, no dressing delivered with the salad. We observe five servers and a gentleman later found to be the manager walk by the table. A random server stopped by the table and asked if we were okay. We explained what was happening and she went and got our server, whom at this point was someone different. At 9:43 we received our two orders of chicken wings. As they dropped off the wings they knocked over the dressings we waited a long time for. I've been here before and while it is never great most of the people we were here seemed to not care.

We dive in to the second basket only to find it hot instead of medium. Uh oh! No big deal right? I'll just have the waitress replace them with what I ordered. NOPE!  I told the waitress the issue and she was nice enough. She said she'd take care of it. A few minutes later I was brought a side of mild sauce and some ranch. I was told,""don't worry, we won't charge you for that.""  Really? I don't use ranch. And mixing the mild with the hot does not make medium. Not to mention the flavor is completely different. When I politely asked to have the wings replaced I was abruptly denied. It's ""against their policy"" to replace wings. How is that against policy? I order one thing and got another. It's against policy to fix your mistakes? I then proceeded to tell them if they won't replace them then take them back and remove the item from my bill. Denied again. They forced me to pay for an item I did not order which they wouldn't replace. RIDICULOUS!!!! I could not believe how poorly we were treated. This was by the store manager! Needless to say we will be finding a new spot to enjoy wings.

The worst part is that upon requesting a slice of pizza the cashier gave major attitude and wouldn't even make eye contact. I felt very unappreciated as a customer. The food was mediocre which to be honest is expected from a restaurant located inside a bowling alley. The service was slow as can be as well, we watched half the tables food sit on the counter under the heat lamp for 10 minutes and actually had to complain in order for our rude cashier to give us the food. Then behind the cashier i see a gallon of milk so with a hungry one year old I request to purchase a glass and to my shock the cashier said no she will not sell me a glass ""it is only for milkshakes.

As a father when you have a hungry crying one year old it is a borderline emergency to find milk and seeing as they have it at the restaurant you would think they can sell me a glass. They lighting is terrible in the restaurant it's sad a grey looking and the restaurant is dirty as well I was afraid to even let my arms touch the table. On a side note, they do not have any hot sauce in their establishment either on salsa upon request. Overall I do not recommend this establishment to any bowlers that come into the otherwise 4 star bowling alley."	0.0

The delivery arrived but food not delivered to our 2nd room floor as all other restaurants have done for past 3 years. Our pizza arrived and looked good, however it tasted of fish or ""fishy"" and like it has been in contact with anchovies. My sister used to have them on her pizza so I KNOW that flavor. I was having a very special night with my partner, an anniversary, and we chose KingPin as they were open and had Italian Pizza. After receiving we tried to call office but no one answered and open until 1am. We went to their Facebook and they didn't have reviews, so I wrote them a personal letter to describe the pizza sauce flavor and that the salads were wilted with browning lettuce. Not something I would ever want to serve. I would not not said anything but wanted to communicate to them as maybe the management would want to know. I did not hear back in 3 days so contacted Grubhub as well and sent an email to KingPin as listed on website but it was returned immediately as a bad email address.
We were hoping they would say they were sorry and give us another shot as we order 3 times a week from restaurants. The driver didn't come to the room and we picked up outside as he was unfamiliar with how to get into this popular extended stay suites. Maybe a bad night for him, too. We forgive but would love to hear from merchant.
The pizza did look good, just had to do with flavor and we didn't get near finishing it. We did have to heat in microwave by the time we received but didn't want to complain about that. Maybe this was a one time bad deal. Since no facebook reviews we didn't want to give a negative and have that affect business but it's important to always be honest.
Thank you.

First of all they don't serve lunch until noon when the whole advertisement for this snack bar is pizza. At 11:30 they denied serving us 2 pizzas & said we could only order breakfast. We're here bowling a tournament so I believe they should have made an exception since we've been here bowling since 9am. We all ordered breakfast burritos which come with a side of salsa & I asked if I could also have a side of sour cream. Jasmine told me I couldn't get a side of sour cream with it before I could even offer to pay the 50 cent or whatever fee it was extra. I would have gladly paid for the side no questions asked. She was extremely rude & unprofessional. I then went back to ask if I could purchase a small cup of milk for my child because the fridge behind Jasmine had a gallon of milk in it. She proceeded to roll her eyes & give me attitude. She then said it was only for milkshakes & that I could walk across the street to get milk from the convenient store. Even though the signs on the door when you walk in say "" no outside food or drinks"". I ended up complaining to the manager because at this point I've had it."	0.0

After a recommendation from a good friend we decide to do a late night dinner. We were greeted by an officer of the Phoenix police department before we even got to the front door. Worrisome?! Once we walk through the doors my eardrums were assaulted with extremely loud music. I'm all for setting a mood but the restaurant was packed with all but 3 tables and us. Not the best group of 7 dinner date atmosphere. We had to scream over the ""tunes"". After waiting for what felt like 20 minutes for our waitress to come over we finally placed our order. I knew the shrimp quesadilla cost $12.99 and the drink was $1.99. High but willing to pay after the waitress said it was a decent plate serving. I also added rice and beans. The meal came out quickly but my white rice was adorned with wrinkly peas and one random Lima bean... Odd. The quesadilla was soggy and there was hardly any shrimp in it. We continually asked for the music to be turned down and we kindly ignored. RUDE! Right before the check came they decided it was a good idea to have a full mariachi band play to all but 9 people. So loud I thought my ears were bleeding. Then the bills come out. We asked to pay separate. No big deal. Then she proceeded to hand out our bills. I looked at the price and nearly fell off my chair. She had added the total of everyone's meals and put a 10% gratuity on it! Not cool!!!! Then I see a charge for $4 for a drink. I asked the waitress what the charge was and she proceeded to tell me that after 9pm the drinks are no longer $1.99. Everyone got water at that same price as well. Never heard of a $4 glass of water. She never mentioned this, nor did it say anything about that on their menu... Pretty petty if you ask me. Now it totally makes sense why there was no one in this place on a Friday night!

Save your money and appetite and kindly write this off as a place to try for lunch.

Before we entered the building, we should have known it would be a bad experience. The place is empty at noon. We were the only guests there the entire lunch hour. When you come in you are greeted by a waitress and what smells like a urinal cake. It's not very strong, but I can only guess it is from the products used to clean. Which is on the plus side, I suppose.

What is with the windows? Why are they spray painted? It's eerie. Spend a few $100 and get them tinted. 

The food is meh and overpriced. There is no lunch menu options and it is so dark inside the building that it takes some time to read the menu. Does this say tostada or taco? I dunno! Just make your best guess. 
Oh, and once you figure out what you do want to order, it may not be available. For example, a fish tostada... nope sorry we don't have that. May I have onions on my tostada? Oh, no. Sorry, we don't have onions either. May I have sour cream on my dish? Uhh... let me check. 

Aside from all of that, you have to pay with a debit card for your meal. Then the waitress is looking at you and asks, ""How much is Tip?"" It's just an awkward experience.

It was 8:17 PM and, of course, Garcia's was already closed waaaaaay ahead of their web-and-store- posted 9 o'clock closing time, so I thought why not try Los Portales?  It's right there, right up the street...give it a shot!

I walked in and glanced at the menu  a young lady asked me what I would like. I told her that I was interested in a combo platter: burrito, relleño, taco rice and beans and she said $7.99. ""Sure"", I said. 

Then we went to beer. ""$4 for a Corona"" she said then she brought out one of those little baby 7 oz Corona's. Are you kidding me? In my neighborhood alone, I've got at least 3 restaurants that serve SIX 7 oz Corona's for $9.99!  I started to sense that there was gonna be a problem or two. I ordered a regular sized Corona for $5. 

The food came: no rice, no beans, no chile relleño. She was made to understand to retrieve those items; the relleño never appeared. 

Now, when, precisely, in American food history did ""carne asada"" come to mean,  ""burned beef"" because somewhere along the way that's what Carne Asada has come to be, MOST ESPECIALLY AT LOS PORTALES!!!!  Horrible, dry, very salty beef with some pepper. Ugh. 

Then I ordered guacamole and it was mediocre. Overall, the food is HORRIBLE, HORRIBLE!

Then the bill came, which should have been $5 for the beer, $5 for the guacamole and $7.95 for the food...I'm not that good at math but I'd calculate that to be about $18. The bill was for $27.95. 

I told her to make the correction or get me the manager but if there wasn't a resolution at $17.95, I was calling the cops before they did/could. The manager, begrudgingly, never got out of his chair, did make the correction.  This is The part where I call the manager and the restaurant names but Yelp won't like it so I'll just leave it at that.

We decided to forego our usual sport bar and we were hoping to catch the Broncos-Packers preseason game. Wanted to go to the sports bar very near Zipps but they were PACKED so, ignoring our intuition, which was screaming to just go to our usual place, we decided to just try Zipps. Again. Even though they never impress us. The place was greater than half empty yet it took several minutes for the hostess to notice us, and then, immediately after asking us if we wanted a booth or table and us answering, she told us she forgot our answer and asked the same question again. Wanted to sit in the bar area at a table but a sign clearly says no children in that area and since we had the teenager with us we were banished to the ""dining area"". No drink list. That honestly is a big annoyance to me, especially when I see multiple beer taps. I placed my bet there that my server would be unable to recite the beers on tap. By the time a server finally came to us, I had forgotten that bet. The greater than 10 minutes we waited just to meet our server were filled with me suppressing the urge to just get up and walk out. When she finally arrived at the table, she thanked us for waiting, although it's still unclear why we waited because there was a total of 8 tables in that area and there were several servers just standing near the kitchen window-presumably waiting for food, but standing for extended periods of time nonetheless. As I suspected, she was only able to name 4-5 draft beers. She told me they had Citradelic IPA so I finally said I would just have that. What ended up coming was NOT an IPA at all, tasted more like Budweiser and I don't drink that crap. We asked for a few minutes with the menu. It's not their fault, but I just wasn't in te mood for burgers or fried food, and none of the healthier options were sparking my interest. It took greater than 10 more minutes for her to return for our food order. Right now I will say that while mildly neglectful, she was at least nice. When I asked whether they had an IPA in a bottle, she replied she didn't know and would check. I told her my current beer was horrible and she did offer to take it back and bring something else but my boyfriend said he would drink it. At that point, I ordered a Lagunitas, a choice which had not originally been offered. My point here is that Zipps management should realize that not every customer of their establishment will order the ""usual"", so having a beer list would alleviate the annoyance to both customers and servers when ordering. Ordered a Zipps chop salad, server let me add grilled chicken to that, description read it was Zipps version of a wedge with blue cheese crumbles and bacon pieces. The salad I got was topped with what I presume is feta (at which point I had regret for not just ordering the Greek salad), microscopic bacon pieces (and very few at that), ice burg lettuce made up the majority of the bowl, and the chicken-which was the good part of the salad. Let me just say that this salad in a bowl was $9. At CK's bar, I get the same size salad that comes as their side salad with WAYYY more bacon and other toppings, for $4 and change. Kid had BBQ burger which looked delicious. His fries were average-seemed fresh cut-everything was hot so that's a plus. Boyfriend got the turkey on rye which he said was ""just ok"". It was at this point that we decided that this was probably our last visit to Zipps because why continue to have underwhelming sports bar experiences in the Awhatukee area when you have choices with better food and service-like Brad's, Philly's, CK's, and even Bleacher's and Tukees?  Should've gone with any of those last night. Oh yeah, one last thing. The Cards preseason game was ending as we sat down-that game was on most of the televisions. After that finished up, the whole bar was forced to watch American Ninja Warrior and then high school baseball-i acknowledge that in a sports bar here is a place for that, but for 80% of Zipps tvs to be displaying that was just one more reason we won't be back."	1.0

I was in there with a friend and we decided to have dinner and a few drinks. I had asked for a 32oz beer that comes in a mug. Mind you it was happy hour and thought it would be nice and cheap. As I was 3/4 done with the beer, I took the glass to take another drink. I immediately felt a prick. I put the mug down and noticed my lips was bleeding. I touched the rim of the glass thinking that ir probably had a small chip. I didn't now feel anything while touching the rim and proceeded to feel the inside of the rim. There was a big sharp chip that had cut my lip. I immediately flagged down the server and showed her. She offered me another one and of course I said no; at this point who would want to drink anymore. She said she would get the manager and she did. After the manager approached us, he apologized and asked me if I was ok. I told him I had cut my lip and he said he was sorry and asked if I was okay. I told him, ""well I think so."" He offered another beer and I said no. He then said okay. And left the table. I was astonished at the way he handled the situation. He is lucky I didn't call my lawyer right then and there. When I asked for my check, he came with it and said, ok I took the beer off. I was very very surprised that he would think that my cut lip was worth the miserable $4.00 that beer costs. I was not expecting a free meal or anything like that, but a diferente approach would have helped. I was really disappointed. I was a restaurant manager before and I know when some very inconvenient thing happened to a guest during my watch, I would take care of their check. Very disappointed."	1.0

My wife and I have frequent evening rehearsals and it's convenient to pick up food from Zipps on the way home, which we've done frequently.  But lately both the quality and delivery of the food has been below par and we'll be going elsewhere.

I like it that I can get a side salad with a burger, but the recent change in lettuce mix to VERY large-cut Romaine with a few other items is not acceptable.  The big leaves make it look like a decent amount, but there's actually considerably less salad, with less flavor, than the previous iceberg-based mix. 

Not putting on-the-side dressing in the to-go bag or box is inexcusable.  But last night's order was missing not only salad dressing on two orders, but there was no side of chili on my green chili burger.  Missing dressing has happened before, but come on!  This is just shoddy performance by the staff -- and to think, we had tipped them before getting home to find their screw-up.  (I guess the solution is to open the tied-up takeout bag and check EVERY item in your order to be sure it's there. I don't want to have to do this.)

My little burger was not very good but the onion rings and fries were down right bad. Onion ring batter is just odd. Maybe they use a corn meal or something? The fries were very floppy but not in that yummy greasy way. Just like when they are re-warmed the next day.  I didn't even like the cola, which I never complain about.  It was so sweet.

The bun was ok, the hamburger meat reminded me of mystery meat in elementary school. I had a good amount of pickles on the burger and in my basket, so I tried one of the loose pickles and it tasted like someone dipped it in hairspray and perfume. The fries were also soggy and cold. I asked one of the guys in our group how his burger was and he commented ""I knew this place was not going to be good"".

We both ordered a different foccaccia sandwich and were totally confused when we got our food, 35-40 minutes later. I know that foccaccia is a type of bread and was expecting the sandwich I ordered to be on that bread, when in actuality it was a wrap.

On 4 different occasions we have had horrible experiences. During the summer when there was  maybe 4 to 5 customers in the ENTIRE place our food took 30 minutes+ to arrive. The bartenders now have huge attitudes. The wings are now soggy and greasy, not at all crispy like they used to be.We used to be longtime and dedicated customers. We also noticed that it hasn't been busy like it used to be when it first opened. Our last time was Friday when the bartender couldn't be bothered to help us let alone be even remotely friendly.

Uneducated, unprofessional, poor communicators, slow, lack basic understanding of customer service and building patronage. There's a reason they can't keep or find wait staff, nobody wants to work here or work under subpar management. The food is good when it arrives even remotely warm or correct, which it rarely does. Not worth risking coming here for the rare times it will be correct. Music is always way too loud to carry on a conversation without yelling.

In a nutshell, you WILL have issues with your food, and with the service, and when you try to get help, you'll likely deal with a worthless, rude, first time ""manager"" like Rafael, who's been there 9 months and like all the others won't last another 3. He hasn't got the slightest clue how to treat customers with respect or retain them, has no comprehension of the cost of acquiring new customers versus keeping long time customers, and is just plain unfit to be ""managing"" anything except maybe a table or two of his own.

My family of 5 has somewhat regularly eaten here and has spent a lot of money each time despite this place's ongoing, never ending issues. We have given them chance after chance and excepted numerous empty apologies and tried them again. No more!! Tonight, worthless ""manager"" Rafael sealed the deal and we'll never return. Well done Raphael, your rude, ""screw the customer"" attitude just cost Zipps their most valuable assets, return customers and reputation. I'll share my experience with everyone.

Look at my reviews. Mostly positive, regularly searching for the good. We've tried with this place, given them lots of chances, too many, and they just don't get it. My recommendation, avoid it like the plague.

Sure, I'll respond to you. First off, telling me I'm bashing your managers when I've clearly stated that Zipps managers, their unprofessionalism, discourtesy, incompetence, lack of customer focus and rudeness are a major part of Zipps problem, is a bit redundant and obvious. Yes, they are ONE of Zipps major areas of concern and reason for low ratings. Managers may show some kind of dedication to you, per your comment stroking their performance, but shouldn't they be trained to show dedication, care and concern for customers? Remember us, those who keep Zipps in business. You asked for help making Zipps better. Isn't that what you've gotten from me, and the NUMEROUS other reviewers who have disclosed the many issues Zipps has? Has anyone at Zipps been listening? I've openly and honestly disclosed the numerous issues with your management, if you want to call that bashing, I suppose that's fine. Second, as previously mentioned, my family and friends and I have dealt with wrong food, cold food, missing food, overly loud music where we've asked to have it turned down time after time, visit after visit, and rude, incompetent (under trained, not empowered, inappropriate) managers many times. Yet for years we've kept giving you chances. More than you likely deserved, but we've tried to support you. I think that ""is"" pointing out recent issues and trying in vain to help you improve. Did you read those parts? It seems your redundant questions may be more Zipps management not listening, instead wanting to be heard and trying to be ""right""? Keep in mind, I have nothing to gain by providing my readers anything but the truth. Nor do the abundance of other reviewers who find issues with Zipps. Last night Rafael decided not to honor a simple, easy, happy hour commitment on 2 small drinks that were already served to us with the clear understanding that they would be honored. That's how it started and could have happily ended. When we asked him in the most friendly and positive way if we could work it out since we were told it would be fine and the drinks were already served to us with that understanding, he rudely, obnoxiously told us no, that he was the manager, this was his restaurant, his boss/GM said no and that was that. When we asked to speak with the GM, Rafael told us no, that he (Rafael) was making the final decision and if we don't like it we can leave. So we did. How's that, does it help you? How about this, my family and friends have ""helped you"" by supporting Zipps through years of bad service and spent thousands of dollars there, now that I've helped you with more information and spent more of my time supporting you with information, how about a personal, in-person apology from Rafael followed by a year of free meals for my family?  That will be your opportunity to make things right. If all is well after that, I'll update my review, provide an updated rating, and everyone wins. My guess is that won't happen, that you'll take my free advice and will give nothing back to those of us that have supported you and have been mistreated in return. Your response will show all readers what Zipps is all about."	8.0

Last week I had the nachos which was absolutely horrible. First of all the food at lunch took over 20 minutes to arrive to the table then the nachos showed up as basically dry chips with oversized globs of Guac and Sour Cream and Salsa on top. The ground beef was mainly toward the bottom and was very greasy. The wings we had as an appetizer that also took too long were very good. 
So last night I went there with my wife and got the club sandwich. I get a sandwich away from home because they are supposed to be better but I could have stayed home and made anything better than what I was served. Wilted lettuce was the first turnoff then the dryness of the sandwich had me taking a sip of beer with every small bite.

Walking in for the first time it was immediately clear that this place was not what we were used to or expecting. The vibe was SUPER weird, there was no music on, the only noise was a giant TV that had a tv show on about ""when pregnancy goes wrong"".. we took are seats, looked around and were like.. wth? The service was terrible. Our waitress looked exhausted and like she did not want to be there, no check backs, I had to get up 3 times to get more place settings, ask for a to go box etc because she never came back. We were sat near the restroom and our whole corner smelt terrible. When I asked for them to put the football game on the TV they gave me attitude and put on some baseball game that no one cared about. I called the manager and told him about what was going on and he was a total rookie. He told me ""oh, well, I just got here so.... ""  totally shifted the blame. He came out to our table and basically said the same thing and asked if we wanted a free dessert. We told him that we would pass on the dessert. We were annoyed because he had not addressed or cared about anything we told him and could tell he was just offering a dessert in hopes that we would shut up. Every time we needed something from our or any server, we never got attended to and they were ALWAYS just standing around by the kitchen talking.

Another waitress confirmed that yes the additional shot should be $1.

This is ridiculous bc they are telling us one thing, then another. I don't see how we can enjoy our food in less than 15 min. Especially when we clarified things to begin with. Otherwise we would have walked out and brought our business to a better restaurant. Coming from a business perspective, the staffs should have been trained to explain the law. We could have ordered food to go. But we were mislead that we could order and eat there. Food should have been comped to make things right instead of having customers walk out angry. Great food, bad service! Don't bring your kids here!!!	4.0

We got back to the house and he took a bite of his fries and asked me to try one. I took a bite, they were rock hard. They were somewhere between a french fry and a potato chip, but more on the stale side. Not sure how that's even possible, but that's how it tasted.

I opened my salad up, and for a Tenderloin Caesar Salad, one of the main components was missing: the Caesar. There was absolutely no dressing on this salad. I looked through the bag, dug through the salad (I though maybe it was on the side somewhere?) but no, nothing. There was a 'decent' amount of beef on the salad, but nowhere near enough to warrant a $10 price, especially since there was maybe 5-6 large bites of lettuce to constitute the whole salad. This was incredibly disappointing, and $10 later, I'm still very hungry.

Zipps has won me over with their cheap prices and friendly service in the past, but with this experience I have nothing positive to say. I'll be back, but I certainly will be double checking take out orders and I can't see ever ordering a salad there again."	3.0

Today was all management. It was empty when we came in, family of 8, and we wanted to see the noon World Cup game. It was empty, I repeat. We sat down and since the table was so small we added another small today to fit our large family. The server came up to us and told us afterwards that we weren't supposed to do this on game day, it was empty, but she'd allow it. So we ordered our first round of food & bloody Mary's because we were starving and thirsty. Then the manager comes up to us and tells us we weren't supposed to move any tables because its game day!? We look around to an empty restaurant and the hungry women state they're 'this' close to leaving since it's empty and we've already been scolded for moving a small table to our large family. He reminds us that's he's just communicating w us and the women had enough and grab their bags. That's six hungry and drinking adults plus to hungry kids, gone over what? Common sense dictates that in en empty restaurant you welcome families. We went to the Garage across the street. Too many good spots nearby to be harassed by a manager in an empty restaurant.	6.0

Very attentive bar staff and I could see the rest of the busy place was being taken care of.  Only question, why have a hostess if all she does is stand there?  No seating, no greeting or acknowledging customers, just staring off into space for an hour or so.

Food... sorry I wanted to like it, but yeck!  Burgers took a while (wasn't complaining) but the great bartender was on point and watching, hooked us up when it was taking to long (due to being slammed?).  Order finally came, disappointing.  First the bottom of the bun was super hot, as if sitting on the 'hot' shelf for a while.  Burgers overcooked, dry and flavorless.  Sides of fries & rings were soggy and greasy and barely warm.  Edible but nothing to repeat.  If they were that busy in the kitchen, assumed I'd have at least fresh fries.  Didn't try the wings which everyone raves about.

It's way crowded and the servers are new and clueless. Bartenders are cool. But....the food is average. The clientele is a lot of riff raff that is not local. It can be a very annoying crowd. Most importantly...do not drink and even think of driving out of here. I've seen young people walk out the front door with beers in hand and get in their cars. I let the manager know and he was not interested. I've now noticed the fuzz setting up nearby and pulling cars into a nearby gas station lot and busting people left and right. The establishment does not care. Just be damn careful. This place is not worth the risk.	4.0

Came her on a late Saturday afternoon hoping to get a bite to eat, have some beers and watch the preliminary UFC fights on Fox sports. The restaurant was pretty much empty and the bar had about 15 people around it watching one of the many tv's playing various sports. When we first came in we asked the hostess if would be able to get one of the tvs changed to fox sports, she said she couldn't but she would find someone who could. We took a place at the bar. Although they weren't busy at all the bartender didn't even acknowledge us because he was too busy flirting with two blonds at the end of the bar. After 7 minutes (yes I timed it) I finally said something to get his attention and we ordered two large draft beers. When he brought them back we asked about changing on of the tvs to fox sports. He said he wasn't sure he could change them and said we didn't care what tv we would even move to a table in a corner where no one was if needed. He left to ask someone and came back and said they were ""having issues"" and he wouldn't be able to change any of the TV's. No other explanation given to what kind of issue.

The onion rings were bad. The server never wrote down our orders and then proceeded to get them wrong. No tomato on the kid's hamburger, as requested, and added jalapeño to the salad when requested to hold it.  She served a salad without silverware and the fish and chips without malt vinegar. All the orders (4) arrived at different times. The tables are also too small for four people. Only use a booth if you have more than three people. This is my third time here and may be my last.	4.0

I go to Zipps to meet up with my husband and our friend who are partaking the waitress finally comes over I ask her what is in her Zipps-a-Rita and she said, ""We pour it out of the frozen machine, then if you want to add extra alcohol you can."" Not my thing.  Instead I asked her if she had a lighter margarita with less sugar, I finally just ordered limes, club soda and tequila (a Nor Cal Margarita).  She looked at me and said, ""That's disgusting."" No joke.

Dude - I don't want all the processed sugar that comes out of your shitty frozen drink! And I shouldn't have to justify my drink order to the waitress.  Now when I get a light margarita at any other bar it comes in a 16 oz glass.  This came in a high ball glass. This was a drink not a mixed shot.  

She did come over and apologize, as I was leaving.  Looking around at the time I was there it was filled mostly with people over 50, the bar was 75% men.

My husband and his friend were over charged for their burgers but they did not complain because they got good prices on their beers.  I am sure that soon the novelty will be gone and they will raise a stink about being over charged on food.

First of all when you order a focaccia sandwich you are expecting a certain type of bread    I ordered the pepper jack focaccia and it came as a wrap and not on focaccia bread.  The second issue was when you order a salad and you are paying $8 for you expect more than just lettuce and a few pieces of chicken.  It would of been nice to have some tomatoes, onions, cucumber or anything else.  The third issue it was unbearably warm in the restaurant.  Now grant it here in Phoenix it was a very hot day, however I have been in numerous restaurants on hotter days and never felt uncomfortable temperature wise.  The last and final issue was service was slow and not talking about the waitress she was very kind and kept bringing us water and pop as needed.  The food took forever to get to us.

When we asked about it she just said she must have been wrong about the lunch special. Did nothing to make it right with us! I was surprised. 

Also a pet peeve: none of these places that have sports on TV EVER show women's sports on any of the sets. Why is that?"	4.0

Would not recommend this restaurant.

Thanks, Tiffany
No we did not stay at the Zippe's, like I said in my comment the staff had a I don't care attitude, and this is not the first time, the staff needs lots better training, someone needs a train them it's about the customer and not the staff. Customer care does not exist at this restaurant, other Zippe's seem to be much more customer friendly, and tries to take care of there customers needs."	3.0

There are plenty of tv's and usually a good amount of seating. Nightly specials and weekends specials are very popular and you can see them on their website. Today I decided to stop by  with my boyfriend on my lunch hour. We ordered the BLT and Chicken skewers, everything was good until my boyfriend started to eat his fries and realized a blue band aid was in there! It was the most disgusting thing I have ever experienced while eating out. I didn't even get to enjoy my full meal because  I was so sick by the sight. The waitress offered to adjust off the BLT but we still had to pay for my meal which I was unable to eat. This is a normal spot for us so it really sucked to find this and then having to pay for a meal I didn't get to eat wasn't making it any better. I only hope that the kitchen staff start to wear gloves esp. when they have an open cut.	0.0

Boy was I wrong.

Let me start out by saying the service was rotten.

We walked over from Little League opening day, and my son was chastised for having a partially full Gatorade container left over from the game. We were told we had to hide it in my wife's purse, and the server would ""pretend she hadn't seen it.""  At first I thought the server was getting after my wife for preparing my 4 month old's bottle.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

The food is what it is. Fairly standard sports bar food. The prices aren't overly expensive, nor are they very cheap.

My chicken fingers ended up being about an eight of an inch in diameter strip of chicken swallowed by two inches of thick, almost tempura like batter. It reminded me of something you'd get out of a fair booth.

My sweet potato chips were fine, except for the quarter inch deep pool of grease under them.

My wife's salad looked like it was left-over from another table from someone who couldn't finish all of theirs. We verified she got ripped off on the way out because two other ladies had the same dish, but had substantially more in their salad bowl.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

My son said his shrimp was bland and the BBQ sauce was too strong. This was unsolicited from a 12 year old.

After having been stuck in there without seeing our server for about 45 minutes, we finally tracked her down, asked for a doggy bag (literally this time) for left-overs.  Several minutes later she returned with the togo container.  

Did I mention the service was rotten?

But with no check.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

After another 20 minutes I gave up and hunted her down asking for the check. Paid and my son wanted a refill on his soda.  I already knew I wasn't going to wait for the server to return to our dimension from wherever it is she disappears to.  So I walked over to the bar where there were 4 bartenders, with my baby in her seat on my arm.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

After standing at the end of the bar for several minutes I realized poor service wasn't limited to just our server, but it appeared to be a store policy.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

So I walked back over to the waitress station and refilled it myself.

Did I mention the service was rotten?

Wasted almost 2 hours of my life in there, and my wife was hungry within two hours of getting home.

In case I forgot to mention it, the service was rotten."	7.0

So to be fair, let me start with what was great about it the first 30 minutes! Hubby and I sat at the bar area after picking up our vehicle form an oil change and wanting to pass some time during rush hour traffic home around 6pm ish on a Thursday. This is now 2 weeks ago but I can't stop thinking about it. We were instantly greeted by a lovely waitress who was attentive and had a great personality and shared the happy hour specials etc. Hubby got his favorite golden wings and I got the turkey chili which was delicious! I've never had turkey chili and it was like pulled pork, seasoned, a bit spicy.. YUM YUM! We were happy they had our beverage of choice and even though not on happy hour was very reasonably priced. We had frequented the Zipps on McLintock & Ray as well as one in Chandler on Arizona and always had a great experience.

I saw a touch tunes and thought.. oooohh how fun, let me play a few jams. I was surprised they had country music blocked which is odd for Arizona, but anyhoo I proceeded to play some of our favorite 70's funk songs from the Gap Band then moved on to 80's Annie Lenox Sweet Dreams, etc. The radio playing switched from radio per bar setting to the juke box. I started with $5, then added $15 more and we were jamming. I started playing some party songs like It's getting hot in here by Nelly. Well, it is Arizona... it does get hot. The happy hour crowd was loving it! People were dancing in their seats by 645 and suddenly at 7pm it was like hearing a record scratch in my mind, the song was cut mid play and the music switched to the bar's radio station.

Having $15 still left in the touch tunes I was worried and flagged our lovely waitress down. She came over and attentively heard our concern and stated that people were really enjoying the tunes and she would see what happened and fix it. She disappeared, came back, said they were working on it. Then the Manager came by with a blank look on his face asking what the problem was. I advised him that I had a ton more songs and $15 in the juke box left to play and the music was turned off. He proceeded to tell a fib to keep things calm and tell me that they turn the music off after happy hour which is at 701pm. This raised my blood pressure as I advised him that a sign, warning, announcement would be nice as patrons add money to it from their phones and I'd have no way of knowing that. I asked for my $15 back. 

Then he changed the story to ""a table complained about the music being inappropriate"" so he decided to turn it off. Higher blood pressure still I asked why Country music was blocked but not R&B songs they didn't like which had no bad words in them at all? No answer. He asked me twice how many of my $15 songs had played to which I responded 4. He left and returned with $15 in cash.  The solution was appropriate to return our funds but it still baffles me why a sports bar would allow a juke box if they don't want people to make their selections or if they want to control their environment to that extent. Why Rhianna songs were ok from the  Radio but not others? Why a family would bring say their young kids to a sports bar during happy hour and then be upset with song selections. All of this coupled with the state of things and us being an interracial couple made us feel a bit ugly about the whole experience. It was unpleasant and ruined our evening and we thought about it for days, now weeks. How bothersome that is. To be just ""declined"", denied, your choice of music is too provocative somehow... then don't give people a choice or filter the songs better to have only happy sugary pop songs played by non-flavored singers.
Love the wings, love the wait staff, love the happy hour prices, loved the vibe until it was cut.
Won't return for more disappointment. Sorry Zipps. You failed us and all the people having a great time along with us chair dancing. Perhaps you can open as an Applebees? Forget the sports bar part.

Tonight was my first visit to their new location near my house in Chandler. I had been craving some hot wings for a couple of weeks, and tonight I finally went out to satisfy that craving. Zipps is one of the few places that still has a decent happy hour deal for wings at $6.25 doz. 

I got a dozen hot, and a dozen extra hot. When they arrived the extra hot wings smelled a little burnt, but I always start with the hot, and move up to the extra hot. The hot wings had lots of sauce on them, but they were not very hot. They were very soggy, and barely cooked. The burnt smell on the extra hot had me concerned, so I tried one after my second wing, and they were nasty. They were not hot at all, but they tasted like burnt peppers, which is exactly what they were. Their extra hot was just some oil that they dumped a bunch of red pepper flakes in and burnt them to the point that they cooked out the oils that make them hot. There was not red sauce at all, just blacked red pepper flakes, and wings were soggy as well. I finally got the servers attention and let them know they were bad. I requested just hot wings as a replacement. 

When the replacements came they had virtual no sauce on them at all, but at least they were a little more done. I wouldn't call them crispy, but at least they were completely cooked. Thankfully the first batch of hot had sauce left in the bottom of the basket. Normally I take home about a about 6 or 8 wings from the two dozen order, but after these wings had very little meat on them so I finished them all. 


I am hoping this was just an off night, so I will give them another chance, but it's sad to see that the new location isn't an improvement from their prior store. The server was a little overworked it seemed. They only had one order taker, and one food delivery girl in the bar area. Two real waitresses would have been a better idea. I hope they find a better cook. when half of the menu is fried food, they need someone who knows how to use a fryer."	5.0

I did not receive any calls or show any missed calls. When I said that, they said that maybe they called the wrong number. Likely story. 

So then I asked which store I should order from. They couldn't tell me and asked if I have the app on my phone and I could find it there.  I realize apps are convenient at times, but they should not replace customer service. Hopefully my credit card will not be charged since I never received my order. 

I am unlikely to patronize Jimmy johns again even though I have ordered from them many times in the past and I have previously had a good experience.  If you do place an order, make sure that you ask whether you're in their delivery area.  Don't assume that they will tell you if you're not."	0.0

The bad: ordered my sandwich and got no questions about what I wanted on it. Had to make sure to tell them to add sprouts, shouldn't they ask if it's an option? As soon as I paid I looked at the other ingredients and asked if they could add hot peppers. At the same time they handed me my sandwich. Great that it only took 30 seconds to make, but... They refused to give me a side of hot peppers. Said they would have to charge me for the side.  To do it free, they would have to unwrap my sandwich, add the peppers, and give it back to me. It's the same amount of peppers, why not just put them in a cup???  

Also, there are no napkins to be found anywhere. They don't give you one with your sandwich even if you say you're eating at the restaurant. Had to ask where to find them and they are hidden behind the counter. They made me reach behind the counter to grab some. Why not just have a napkin dispenser by the condiments like every other restaurant in America?

The sandwich was good, but the way they put it together made all of the meat slide out the backend. I don't know if it's the fact that they put too much mayonnaise on the bread, or something else. But it's annoying to constantly have to hold the ingredients in the sandwich while you're eating to avoid them squirting out under the table.

First they get rid of Caesar salads for the fresco salads, then they get rid of a rewards program that actually was good with a program that while adds more places (if you shop those places) but costs twice as much to get any rewards, and now they get rid of the 2 for $20. Instead of the 2 for $20 they have a new 3 for $10.99 which includes an app and a mini molten cake desert. While this is good for singles or good for couples that don't both want off the 2 for $20, this new program is far more expensive. Not only is it $1.98 more expensive off the bat, but under the apps it no longer allows chips and guacamole without a surcharge. It also costs a minimum $2 extra for the sirloin which used to fall under the 2 for $20. If a couple wants this deal, but only wants 1 app, you can't even combine to 2 apps to save the $2 guacamole charge even though they save an entire appetizer price. Also some entrees no longer come with all their sides that they use to (mango chili chicken no longer comes with rice). They do still have the 2 for $35 that covers the old 2 for $20 just with 2 margaritas  (if both are able to drink, ie not working later).

I didn't speak with a manager or if she was, then she didn't care that the food made us sick.	0.0

PROS:
Good ambiance, Clean, Friendly staff
New digital menu and easy to pay pods. 
New Menu with new items. 

CONS

Only one and it overrides every PRO they have. Food is ridiculously bad. Oily, onions on the grill item not sauteed right. Fish was undercook and smelly with half a pot of red chilis sprinkled on top. Only good thing we got on our table was the Flatbread and the dessert in the end. The steak and Chicken fajita steak doesnt look anything like in the menu picture. It looks like a kids version of the picture with no seasoning and oily onions. Who is cooking this stuff in the back? Seriously, you can get better food at McDonalds. I hope they find a better chef or train the ones they have the right way. 

Im giving it 2 stars because the manager was nice enough to take the fish off our bill.. I actually wanted to send the whole table back. We were there to eat, not to waste 1 hour and get half cooked fish."	1.0

Same as before took about 10 minutes to be acknowledge and another 10 before I got my tea.

Ordered the ribey (med well), skillet mashed potatoes and the brocolli (to honor GHW Bush, lol).  They steak came as ordered and hot.  I got some tepid fries but he corrected it (ended up passing on the cold stale fries) and the mashed was ok.  I did not know you could over cook brocolli it was way DRY and looked like it had been sitting under a heat lamp all day.

Server never came back to check to check up on me after the mix up our the brocolli  would have been gone too.

We where seated promptly and that is the last positive thing that was done. Server finally came about five minutes later and took our drink order. Ten  minutes later drinks finally came. He then disappeared. We waited over 15 minutes and he never showed up. I went to the dinning room host to ask where the server was. Another five minutes he came and took our order. We waited and waited for our food to come and the server was no where to be found. Finally I got up again and he was taking another order right behind me. Now we have been in the restaurant for over 45 minutes. He finally brought the food. You could tell it had been sitting in the heat lamp for quite a while.  He never came back to see if we needed refills or anything else. 
The food usually quite good. My wife and daughter had no complaints but mine, I had steak fajitas. The steak was as tough as nails. I did not want to have it replaced as It could have taken  another half hour. The toppings that come with them is a joke. There was so little salsa it could not be even a spoon full.
After this experience needless to say the tip was what the server deserved.
I probably will return but if the service is not improved I  will just not go there I will try the new Red Robing just down the street."	0.0

I'm on a very special diet and can't eat chips.

Our meals came 5 minutes later and my steak was raw.  I showed the manager and he took it off the check.  The entire incident could have been handled better.  For instance, why didn't they put our orders to the top of the list when she realized we'd been sitting there for 30 minutes?

To recover from a cold and rainy weekend we decided to have a light dinner. After sitting at our booth without acknowledgement from any waitstaff someone finally approached out table. We finally ordered. He ordered the above with a Coke, I ordered a bowl of Loaded Potato Soup with a Mango Iced Tea. Our son ordered the kids Cheeseburger Bites with a bottle of root beer. Drinks took another 10 minutes and were delivered with our chips. Food came out about 10 after that. 

My rating isn't based on the food, it was tasty  as always, and on par with your average Chili's. The 2 stars is based on service. After dropping off our drinks we never saw our waitress again. A random server brought out our food, which had already started to cool. Another minute and our soups would have been cold. Our waitress never returned to give us drink refills, never returned to see if our food was ok, never returned to see if we needed anything else. We saw her twice. Once when she finally initially greeted us and took our order since after sitting 15 minutes. Once when she dropped off our drinks and bottomless chips. (good thing we didn't need more chips. $7.99 for a basket of chips and a small cup of salsa)

I know we only ordered soup but our bill was still $29 without the tip. 

Thank goodness for the check yourself out kiosk on the table or we probably would still be waiting for our waitress to find her way back to our table.

Got there 10 minutes early and we wait for 10 before anyone spoke to us. Then we were told to pay at the bar. I had an old gift card with 25 dollars and it came out to 24.90. So I just put 25 dollars.

As a former pizza delivery person I don't tip on pick up because they aren't using gas, their own car and are not serving me like a waitress. I always tip 15% minimum and not until I get my food. We sat and waited for awhile then a man on drugs dirtyish as if he was homeless start talking to us in the waiting area. Trying to sell me supplements or join his pyramid scheme I couldn't tell.

I was desperate to get out of there. My food was suppose to be ready at 9:20 and was ready at 9:35. The lady came out while he was mid speech. I took my food and left.

I got home starving, just wanting to eat and touched my 1st tortilla. Cold. Okay don't panic cold tortillas aren't bad. Meat. Cold. Quesadilla, onion rings, everything is cold. I am very angry at this point. I look at my sides my cilantro isn't even enough to be a side and has a black thing in it that resembles a booger.

None of the sauces even touch the halfway mark. So I go online and fill out a complaint form. I wait a day for a reply. None.

I post @chilis on Twitter with photos of my food they tell me to fill out a online complaint form. I reply I did already. I am ignored. When I was stationed in Japan I ate at the base chilis all the time and it was great.

I lived in flagstaff and that chilis was great. The chilis at metro center in Arizona is horrible.

4407	UqhVZYUeoBGroYpZB-9jlQ	0.0	0.0	1.0	A few months ago my son and I went to this location and enjoyed a marvelous experience with great food, and a brilliantly wonderful waitress that I left a 50% tip.  Believe me, she was amazing!  This time we were so excited as it would be our second visit and let me tell you, I left the waitress a 0% tip.  This is something I never did before.  After we put our order in we noticed people coming in after us, getting their food, paying, and leaving.  I kept looking for our waitress while trying to keep my son entertained, but she forgot we were even there.  Then she came and told us that the kitchen was backed up.  Yes, she lied.  If she had been honest and said she forgot to place the order I would have understood as we all make mistakes.  She chose to lie, when we had eyes to see others eating.  Then we waited even longer.  Like, really long considering I got a very simple salad, and my son got the fajitas.  Nothing that should take so long.  Well, it was my son's first experience with fajitas, and I explained to him how they come out sizzling in the pan, and the smell is incredible.  Luckily, the table next to us, which came in 30 minutes after we placed our order had also ordered the fajitas and my son was able to experience that excitement vicariously.  It would still be 45 minutes before his showed up.  No sizzle, no smell, and a bit on the cooled off side.  My salad was soggy from sitting around so long, and drizzled in queso fresco, which I asked to be left off because I'm vegan.  Oh, and thanks for the burnt flatbread, that just made it all so much better.  And I'm talking about the bottom and edges being charcoal black and disintegrated.  Trying to get her back again after she threw our plates in front of us and ran off was ridiculous.  There was no point because she was done.  So she forgot to place our order, forgot to pick it up when it came out, ignored us until another worker (twice) sent her to our table, lied to us, didn't offer a dessert or a drink refill for myself.  Thankfully she did refill my son's lemonade while looking me in the eye and lying about the kitchen staff.  The vast contrast of service we received during those two visits was off the charts.

I never tried the food because in the hour I was there, the hummus I ordered never came.  The burgers we were going to order also didn't come because the server barely came back enough times for us to place that order.  It took OVER 45 minutes to get one beer.  The best part is after I told the server to cancel our next round, the manager came over to apologize and said he wanted to make it right.

The food was not very good and small portions. They ""ran out"" of their ingredients to the drink I ordered - one that was highlighted on their menu. And most frustratingly- they somehow put my son's' order on a separate ticket and it took 20 minutes AFTER the rest of the food arrived and no attempt to make it right by comping, or offering a dessert for the wait. We barely saw out waitress. For a new business to mess up and not ever try to apologize to customers doesn't bode well.

Terrific concept-neighborhood hangout/sports bar-with fun front yard of artificial grass, retro-y red & white outdoor furniture & lawn games. Lots of tvs that hubby will like. D, a vegetarian, said she was starving and ordered 2 kinds of bruschetta & a side salad. I ordered the fig and goat cheese salad. While the plump burrata w/ pesto bruschetta looked amazing, D couldn't get a knife through the rock-hard bread part. As the other bruschetta was scorched black, she didn't even try to tackle it so asked the very nice waitress to send it back. Another order came back quickly, this time not so blackened but the crust was just as impossible to bite that D was afraid she'd crack a tooth. Thankfully, that was taken off our bill. Her dinky side house salad for $5 was served in such a small little bowl that made it awkward to eat. Meanwhile, my salad had beautiful little fresh figs on a bed of greens with pickled red onions and little pea-sized lumps of white cheese that really tasted like bland feta rather than ""goat cheese."" Guess I was expecting larger clumps of creamy, tangy goat cheese. I know feta sometimes is made with sheep's and goat's milk, but it's not the same as ""goat cheese."" Size of salad & ingredients not worth the $12. Felt bad that D went away still hungry, but I'm willing to try again in the future."	2.0

I arrived around noon last Sunday the 3rd, I had trouble finding the NFL game I wanted to view, I did find a small vignette sitting area with two TV's, a gentleman that I assumed was in management, was kind and courteous and quick to switch one of the two TVs to my game. Shortly there-after, I was approached by a second gentleman, I assume another manager, he ask if I would relocate to the bar, he would then turn my game on one of the many TV's in that area, because he mentioned he had a large party that was waiting to be seated and he could put them in the area where I once was, I noticed 10 minutes later it was actually 2 people, and remain 2 people for the remainder of the time I was in the establishment, which was about an hour and a half. In this area there were two flat-panel TVs and enough space for 6 individuals, I easily could've stayed where I was, and the couple that replaced me at this location would've had adequate privacy.
I ordered a bloody mary from one of the female bartenders, a gentleman bartender asked me why I don't like bacon, not knowing what he was referring to, I replied, I love bacon, he said ""oh they forgot the most important garnish"" and he placed a nice strip of bacon in my beverage. I asked the same male bartender if he could describe the different wing sauces to me and he said he had not tried them and didn't really have enough understanding to give me a description, I went ahead and ordered wings with one of the different and unique sauces, it took about 45 minutes to receive my order and once I receive them, they were lukewarm at best. Once I received my guest check I noticed one of the bartenders had taken her discretion and given me Tito's for a $2.00 up charge, which I did not request Tito's, The bill was adjusted.
By the way, Windsor, St. Francis The Vig, & many establishments on Sundays do some great bloody Mary specials and even have bloody mary garnish bars, food for thought!
I understand you're new, I've owned two businesses, but I always looked at my business in this scenario, if I were a hospital, I couldn't merely say ""oh we're new, sorry we killed the first 30 people, give us a few weeks and will get it right"".

I went last night with my husband, sister and bro-in-law, and was truly disappointed.  Granted, this is their ""soft opening weekend,"" but you'd think they would strive even more to make a good impression.  We were all truly disappointed in this place.  First off, the service was super slow (our server was very friendly) but overall the service was slow, they take an order and disappear for 20 minutes, ask for more water and wait another 20 minutes.  Our table ordered two cocktails, an old fashioned and a manhattan, both were pretty bad.  The Manhattan was sent back and a beer ordered in its place because clearly this is more of a beer hangout place than a place to order cocktails.  My sister asked if they could make a hot toddy and the server said that the bartenders could make one as long as she found hot water for them.  The server asked the kitchen if they could get her some hot water and the answer of course was NO.  What the heck!? How hard is it to get someone some hot water??  Again, i know this is just he first few ""soft opening"" days but still; come on!  Nothing about this place made a good impression.  Oh, and the cocktails are all priced at $11-$13, no thank you considering the cocktails we had were pretty terrible.     My disappointment with this is that on their street sign it says ""food, cocktails, games, sports,"" so don't advertise yourself as a ""cocktails"" place if you can't deliver.  The whole concept is cool, a place to hang out, games etc, but not impressed with the slow service, poor drinks at high prices for a place like this (the Vig next door is a very similar spot and you can count on yummy drinks at lower prices) and the kitchen not being at all accommodating.  Coincidentally we ended up going to the Vig afterward and they were able to get my sister a pot of hot tea, honey and bourbon=hot toddy.

They do serve a mean corona light, though. Hoping this is just early opening issues, may try again in half a year if they are still open. On a positive note, Santa showed up!	3.0

I understand that they are new and need to work out some issues but when the wait is over 30 minutes for some eggs and toast, well, that's too long.  They had a menu which looked very good only to find out you can't order from that menu until 1pm. Then why put that menu out on the tables? Oh for the drinks on the back? Poor excuse, get a separate menu. Oh and how about having some salt and pepper at the table? Pitchers of water at the table would have solved our 10 person table water problem, rather than bringing one glass at a time. As it was we ate in shifts as the plates came out one by one with a waiter walking around trying to find out who on the patio the meal was for. So disorganized!

For the last few months I have been passing by it on my way to a local school to work as a Student Teacher. Today was the last day I needed to complete before I graduated. My husband wanted to celebrate and take me somewhere nice to celebrate. I requested The Porch thinking it would be a perfect fit. 
Upon we put in our name with the hostess. She warned us it would be a 30 minuet wait. It was a little chilly outside but we thought 30 minutes wouldn't be to bad. She took our name and phone number and told us there were games outside to play. We walked around looking for the games but they were awkwardly placed near diners and it didn't feel comfortable to step up. We looked around inside and saw a good number of open tables meant for small groups so I figured the 30 minuet wait would be accurate.
We sat outside on cute lawn chairs and waited for the Text for our table. After 45 minuets my husband went to check on the wait time, he was told 6 couples were still ahead of us. I looked around the dinner and outside area and still saw open tables. After an hour and a half wait my husband went up agin and asked. We were told the only way we could be seated was if we shared a picnic bench with strangers outside. I was hungry and agreed. As we passed by their were still available tables inside that apparently we were not good enough for. The people next to us acted surprised that we were seated and while I didn't ask them I assume they were not asked if they would share they way they reacted. 
So we sit outside looking at menus, no space heaters, no fire in the fire place. 15 minuets go by and no one comes. Finally a guy named Jeff stops by asking us if the food he has is our order. We tell him now and inform him that nobody has been by to check on us. He tells us very friendly that he will find her server and leaves. We wait some more and decided has finally been enough and agree that we will leave to go celebrate somewhere else. Jeff meet us as were leaving And informs us that he is been trying to look for server I can't find them. We tell him everything that went down and that Larios ready to leave. Jeff was very friendly and I bet if he Had been helping us in the first place the situation may have been different but it wasn't enough. I can't even write a review about the food or drinks or anything else because the whole experience was so bad I'm not sure what to even say more but avoid this place.
I hope that management repress and correct the situation so that this can be the new addition to the community that I hoped it would be."	6.0

The hostess tried to put us at some ridiculous little table by the bathroom right underneath the speaker.  I refused the table and she said I couldn't  give us Any of the vacant four tops.  Best option we settled for outside. They gave us two chairs with a little rickety IKEA low table. It about fell over at least three times. We complained, but our drink girl said ....that's what we do here and didn't even offer to get us a better table. It was cold outside but there were only three heaters. Took twenty minute to get someone to take a drink order, then another 20 to get the drinks. We have still not been offered food service. Finally got our drinks......my wine was a 3 oz pour for $12. My guy got a Manhattan for $12 it was not good and only about 3 oz. Food menu is nothing special .....Salads, burgers , wings, and pork bellies. I got a burger...it was slimy...full of sauce....every time took a bite of it everything squished out. My fries were cold when I got them, But nobody ever came back to check on us so that I could send them back. When she finally came back 30 minutes later she said she would give me some new hot fries but I told her I was done eating.  She did apologize or seem to care much at all. 
We just opted for our tab and left.  When we went to retrieve our car at valet they were so busy that they brought our car up and took off to retrieve other cars. They didn't even wait for their tip.  Weird!!  The service was off the chart horrible. The menu is weird and the drink prices are ridiculous.  Even though it looks like a cool place music was ridiculously loud and there was no variety. They played a very consistent old , loud rock 'n' roll genre. I would not go back And give this place a second chance. The food was bad but the service was worse."	0.0

Completely unacceptable. 
There is nothing special about this place which is just too bad. Just basic. 
Drinks are served in plastic glasses which in itself is not necessarily a problem, the the dirty water spots are. Also, please use short straws in short glasses. I saw them on the other side of the bar but got a super awkward long straw in my drink. Water was served in a rocks glass not a normal water glass like everyone else at the bar. 
I do like the bars stools and that they are not crammed together giving people some space.

4434	2W7ATgSmo2hnTM3e8081VA	0.0	1.0	1.0	"OK/average food but the worst service (breakfast) I may have ever had! It was a Sunday morning at the resort, so they should have expected a lot of people. We arrived at 8am, so it was not yet full. We waited ten minutes to tell the hostess we had a party of 2. Then, she says she needs to have us wait for ten minutes because she just gave a new table to each of her servers and wanted to give them time to catch up. ...ok, we wanted to sit but that seems fair. 

We walked the Lobby for 5 minutes and come back to see she has seated EVERY party behind us... Most 3-5 people per party. What?!? So, we finally sit down and wait about 5 minutes for our server. Still, the restaurant is not full and most are eating at the buffet so her job should be super easy. We order off the menu and she brings a cup of coffee, waters and never-ever returns! Someone else brought our food. We waited 15+ AFTER we were done eating. NOBODY came... We had to leave; we were in a hurry. She was checking on other tables (literally right next to us) and just never came to us. I had to go into the kitchen to get her. Seriously, if tried being patient, tried to flag her down... Terrible terrible service, as this is not what you'd expect from a resort like this.

I was beyond frustrated because we'd been done eating for at least 15 minutes and throughout breakfast I was dying for a coffee refill - which I never got. I have no idea why she was so out of it or seemed so ""in the weeds."" As a former waitress, I feel I'm allowed to make the judgement that she was a terrible server. Net, the food was good, but the staff from the hostess to the waitress were bizarrely terrible!

So... Do NOT go here. Get your car from valet, drive to eat elsewhere, and you'll still be back before you would be if you are here. Plus... It was overpriced. I rate it a half-star, but Yelp only gives solid stars so I'll do them a solid and round up."	4.0

Coffee and a fork to stir for me. We placed our food order. Then waited. And waited. Finished our drinks. No refills. When the food finally arrived I figured out why it took so long:  they were blackening the bacon. Yep, they served us totally black bacon!  Yuck!  No apologies for the wait or anything. My son was still hungry after his kids pancake. (He wouldn't eat the bacon.). So we bought him a pastry in the gift shop after our $50 family breakfast. Will not return.	1.0

But last night was just terrible!
We went to the hostess to request a table for two, the restaurant wasn't even that packed..there were so many seats open. 
But it took them 10min to ""clear our table"" which was already clear (we could see it from the entrance).
We got seated and waited at least 10min for someone to come. The waiter asked for our drink order and told him we were ready to order our dinner. He goes ""I'm just here for drinks..let me check with the other tables and will come back for your order"". We didn't understand why he couldn't just take our order and put it in...he was gone for 15min and he finally came back to take our orders and brought our drinks. My friend had asked for a straw and he said okay, walked away.. We asked another waitstaff for a straw, they said okay and walked away...then the manager comes up and we asked her for a straw but again she said I'll be back and never came back. It's a straw, how hard is it to get one???

Food came 30min later..and the food was great. I ordered the grilled corn and quinoa salad. Once they took our plates away, we asked for the check..and my friend ordered another beer. It took them another 20min just to bring the check and they forgot about the beer. 

All I can say was that service was SLOW!!!!! 
They didn't come back to check on us to see how we were doing, no refresh on drinks...they weren't friendly either!

The service was amazing, our server was very charismatic, extremely helpful and was punctual with the drinks and food.  I've ordered the bloody Mary with Kettle one vodka (not up to part),  We started with the grill artichokes,  although it was our first time trying it, it really was not the best, or met our standards.  I ordered the NY strip medium rare with a side of garlic mashed potatoes and she ordered the Rotisserie Chicken.  The New York strip ($33) was a little bit undercooked, and it still had all the fat around it.  Clearly could had gone to texas roadhouse for a better steak and cheaper and for a bigger portion.  The mashed potatoes were not buttery or seasoned correctly and there was no gravy.  The Rotisserie Chicken was pretty good but again it only came with a side of teaser salad for starters.   To culminate this, $160 it is really not worth this place, don't get me wrong the view is extremely nice, and the service great but the food mhmm so not worth it.	1.0

In a word: disappointing. the eggs, bacon and sausage were fairly good but the pastries at costco were better and the french toast was completely inedible - worst I have ever had in my life. Ever. Extremely overpriced and the service was slow and way below average. For a quality resort, you would think they would at least serve filtered water; nope, tap water. Which in Phoenix, is awful.

It is honestly surprising to me that this place still stays in business. I don't say this because of one bad experience, I have been to Sandbar at least 10+ times and each experience is worse than the last. 

Imagine a staff that is completely all in training and seems like they've all been fired from every last job they had. This is the staff at Sandbar. They are all unorganized, rude, and do not know what customer service is. The bartenders don't know any drinks. One time I ordered 4 Washington Apples and the bartender made some sort of Pineapple drink and when I brought up it was the wrong drink, she said ""well I thought what your ordered was gross, so I made you this instead."" 

Management is even worse. For my brother's birthday we bought a $500 cabana. My brother was kicked out because ""he was drunk."" I'm sorry but I don't know very many people who go to a bar and stay sober. My brother was perfectly fine, wasn't rude to anybody, wasn't mean to staff or was an unpleasant presence at Sandbar.

Also my friend got sick from the food and then we were asked to leave. Just because she had a drink does not justify  that she was drunk. I spoke to the manager to explain my issues he was very rude and disrespectful. I think the only thing he should be managing is the BATHROOMS!!!!!

Once our entrees arrived the server never came to our table to ensure our orders were correct or inquire if we needed anything. Our lunch was about 70% complete when she finally appeared at our table reeking of cigarette smoke and inquired if my husband would like another glass of wine.  She ignored the fact my drink was completely empty and turned to leave. We had to stop her and request a refill of my Diet Coke.

This place was wall to wall people.  There was an overabundance of girls with the same ""edgy"" hair cuts/colors, who looked like they had the same tattoo artist.  That comment actually holds true for the guys as well.  I lost count of how many Ramones t-shirts I saw, and then there were the ""Keep calm and carry on"" t-shirts some guys were sporting.  I see that saying on mugs a lot, so I was entertained that it was the shirt of choice for picking up chicks on a Saturday night, and was left wondering if these guys even knew the origin of that saying.

Tonight I had one of the worst customer service experience at this place . It was a kick back night for me and my roommates. Our 1st round of drinks consisted of one bartender asking repetitive idiotic questions about our drink order.Although baffled by her stupidity, I continued to be polite. The 2nd round consisted of pricey and  watered down don Julio shots in which the bartender claimed the shots were bigger than we thought because the glasses were ""big"". Trust when I say these were shots were watered down. This is not my first Rodeo folks. the next round consisted of the same round of shots for even more $ with no rhyme or reason. My roommates brushed it off.  
Shortly after, a bouncer proclaimed that he needed to see my ID for a 2nd time. And after asking him what the purpose was, he responded with ""there's a state law that requires you to furnish your idea when asked"". After I asked him exactly which law he is referring to and to see if he could show me HIS id, his response was ""I don't know which law but it's a statute and now you have to go. "" - dumbass.
The manager who we spoke with ending up being douchier than the rest and was very unhelpful. 
WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. It doesn't take a lawyer to recognize when someone is a liar with no ambition and nothing better to do with their sorry, unfulfilled, and meaningless lives.

I paid $20 dollars to get us both in as a cover charge and then ordered an overpriced $10 cocktail. After about 10 minutes I noticed my psycho ex girlfriend was also there. She soon noticed me and started following me around the bar grabbing on to my waist as I was walking. I told her to get off me and repeatedly pushed her off as she kept on trying to grab me. I immediately went to security and told them that the girl was harassing me and for them to watch her. About 5 minutes later some overweight bald bouncer asked me to step outside while they investigated the situation. I explained what was going on and I was very frustrated as I was the one who initially reported the incident to security. Instead of investigating the situation with both parties or viewing the security cameras they kicked me out because I asked to talk to someone in charge (The security guard didn't like that I wanted to talk to someone who actually had some intelligence). Worst bar experience ever! I couldn't even have security's help when I specifically asked for it. It's not always the females getting harassed in the bars fellas.

Two of us are vegan which we told the waitress so she could assist us in ordering items that do not have meat or dairy products in them.  She told us that both the black beans and refried beans had meat but the rice was completely vegan.  We ordered veggie items with rice as our side dish.  The food was average and the server was friendly but very slow.  We asked for drink refills on two separate occasions and they arrived 20 minutes later each time.  It was not busy in the restaurant so it is puzzling that it took so long to refill water and ice tea.  The manager came by to ask how our food was and I made the suggestion that they offer beans made without meat for vegan and vegetarian diners.  She explained that they are in the process of changing their menu to include gluten free items and more vegetarian dishes.  She told us that currently the beans and the rice are all made with meat (chicken stock is used to prepare the rice) but they were working on changing this.  I told her that the waitress assured us that the rice was vegan and she said that the waitress didn't know.  I told her that the servers should know specifically as customers have dietary needs.  She apologized and gave us vouchers for a return trip.  I understand she was doing her best to make us happy and she was very apologetic.  It is very frustrating to eat in restaurants that do not teach their servers what is in the food or at least to make sure servers ask before guessing and bringing it out after the customer has made it clear what their needs are.

That you can't use for flying and such. But I'm sure everyone's knows this, with the exception for the bouncer that is supposed to be his main role, to check ID's and be knowledgeable about it.  This Guy took my license away and went to a group a people where everyone was just checking my ID. This is ridiculous. Exposing my personal info to random people!! I'm just blown away by the lack of training of these guys. Even when I asked to speak to their supervisor these processes to tell me that they don't have one manager on duty! Really?

I have lived in Desert Ridge for about 5 years now and I finally gave up.  The food is underwhelming, drinks are expensive, and the staff doesn't really seem to care much because heck, it's always busy.  There are a lot of X-factors that bring people here like DJ's at night, lots of TV's for sports, and unique atmosphere.

We were sitting at a table with 4 other friends conversing and security just randomly came up to my buddy and said ""you need to leave right now you are too intoxicated."" He didn't even get to finish his second drink. I think it was because we were taking up a table and not spending a lot of money on drinks or food right away. Not quite sure. When I respectfully asked the security what happened and what my friend did to get kicked out he was disrespectful and brushed me off like he was too cool. He just said ""intoxicated"" and walked away. We went over to City North after and had no problems the rest of the night.

We all know what busy and short staff is...and there was no way she should of been overwhelmed to serve us or even greet us. We actually had to wave her down the second time for drinks.

CHECK PLEASE! we sat back down, to try to finish our tacos.....and a different waiter comes up with a rude face and says, ""are you done???"" I smiled and said no not yet, as I had a taco in my hand eating it. He looked upset with this face ,almost like the other man waitress, ( ANNOYED LOOK) young kid, so rude, came back twice to interrupt us in less than 5 minutes,  I think just to purposely to be rude.

The major problem was our lack of service, and the service we did get was horrible. We were given one waitress for our large party. She might have been able to keep up if she remembered she was a waitress and not a socialite. It would take over a half an hour for her to come get our orders, and once she did, she would take another half hour to deliver them and sometimes she would just straight up forget your order all together. We also noticed we had drinks added to our order that we didn't order. The only time the waitress had a smile was when we were closing our tab and she tried to give her meager attempt at an apology for being a crappy waitress. I am always a big tipper since I worked in the service industry, but this time I just couldn't give her a tip, the service was so horrible that it was the first time in years I gave no tip. But that didn't stop her from getting one. She felt she would add a tip herself. We didn't realize this until we saw our bank statement and she added a $14 tip for herself. We are currently in the process of disputing the charge. Also we found out from several of the other people that went that they double charged anyone who paid cash. They charged the card used to hold the tab and then took the cash they used to actually pay it. My family and friends will never recommend or go to this joke of an establishment ever again!	1.0

She finally comes back to our table to check on everyone and I am able to tell her I would like to order a drink. She didn't ask me what I would like she just stood there and stared at me....okay? I told her which drink I would like and she asked for my I.D.....okay? But she didn't ask for anyone else's I.D at our table? But sure fine maybe I look a little young. I give her my I.D and she switches back and forth looking at the I.D and me for a couple minutes before just setting it down on the table and walking away.

The food was so overpriced for the looks of the quality that we didn't even bother ordering food, not that our waitress gave us that choice or opportunity. Then she closed out one of our friends tabs before he was ready, without asking and just brought him his check.

I ordered a burger and a water. The food took quite a while (around 40 minutes), even though it was very slow. I was fine with that but then the burger was very dry and sort of flat tasting.

I really liked the beach vibe it had and the large outdoor area covered in sand really emphasized that. There was good music playing, lots of people dancing outside and overall the vibe was pretty fun. Now fast forward 2 years and I'm wondering what happened to this place. There is no more sand in the outdoor area! How is it called SANDbar when there is no sand? Sadness and sorrow. Also, there seems to be no more dancing outside, and instead is relegated to the tiny dance floor inside. Not many people like to dance here, which would be great for me except the music is not that great. There was a string of slow, not fun songs playing when finally one great song comes on! The DJ then proceeds to cut it off and continue playing bad music. 

I don't know what has happened in two years but the Sandbar I went to recently was not how I remembered it. To top it all off, there is a cover charge and the drinks get fairly pricy. Not worth it if the vibe of the bar isn't the greatest. I don't think I will be back anytime soon."	3.0

I don't know if this is a new thing or of they've always done this but I don't think it's right. I went in here 3 days ago to have a couple beers with a friend. So I ordered a beer and had them keep my tab open. They took my card and then returned it to me with a receipt they make you sign to keep you open. All it had said is that by signing this your card will be held and that they don't need a signature if you were to walk out on your tab. What they DONT tell you is that they put a 50$ hold on your card that will take up to 3 business days to return to your account. So my 9$ tab was showing 50$ in my account and I had no clue why. I called and talked to manager Alecia and she explained to me why it was showing 50$. They don't tell you any of this when you start a tab and I don't think that's right at all.

It just sucks that the security guard who I thought was nice who saw me limping my way up the ramp holding the rail and he heard me say while he was checking my ID that I just wanted to order some tacos and get the hell out of there. Which would have been the perfect time to tell me to limp back to my car and go elsewhere but no he let me limp to the bar only to be told the kitchen is closed and that a man will have some tacos that I guess he brings from home at 11:00 or so and basically I would have to wait an hour for some tacos on taco tuesday and shit it would be damn near wed before I could get some tacos???  Hahaha The bartender was ok i guess but the security guard who I thought had a cool vibe dropped the ball. My foot is killing me I know it's not the Sandbars fault but it just sucks that businesses don't take pride in basic fundamental customer service like they used to anymore. No one is perfect but with my basic common sense as soon as the customer states they want something that is unavailable everyone from the top down should be on the same page in order to keep the customer happy and be able to explain what the situation is. In short the damn security guard should have not let me walk extra in agony when he could have just told me the kitchen is closed at 10:00pm sorry no tacos for you buddy.

A few years ago my (then) friend stole my ID since she was underage and I had just turned 21. I found out from mutual friends that she went to Sandbar at Desert Ridge on a Friday night and used my ID. The ID was confiscated because she apparently couldn't recall what the address was. 

When I found out about the incident, I figured Sandbar would do the responsible thing and turn it over to the authorities, contact me or shred it. 

Turns out, the security guard that took the ID had pocketed it and SOLD MY ID to one of their under aged friends!!!!! 

I contacted Sandbar with all the evidence and proof and they gave me the run around. I had been calling the manager daily for almost two weeks. I left voicemails and never received a call back or apology, they never owned up to selling my ID. I even came in with my father one morning 15 minutes before opening and was told the manager was ""unavailable"" to speak with me.

I reserved a table for Super Bowl Sunday which was my Birthday on 02/01/15. My first issue was walking up to the door of Sandbar and the lady saying that there was a $5 cover charge. I tell her that I have a reserved table and wasn't told that I have to have a $300 minimum on top of a $5 PER PERSON cover charge. She says we just decided to charge a cover charge BUT it will be deducted from your tab. I say ok since it will be deducted. (Issue #1)

When I called and talked to Justin the ""VIP Host"" over a week prior to my Birthday he asked me how many people am I expecting...I said probably 8-10 and he said ok. He never mentioned the amount of chairs allotted per table. I get there as planned at 2pm on Sunday and the table is all the way in the corner in the back. Barely no one was at the other reserved tables yet so I ask to move tables. I guess the waitress felt like she needed Justin ""The VIP Host"" and he comes over and doesn't say hello or nothing just goes into NO YOU CANT MOVE TABLES and I told you over the phone that the tables seat 6. I said No, you didn't and he proceeds to say yes he did. (Issue #2) So, I notice my attitude turning the wrong direction on my birthday so I decide to let it go. Also, had we left he would have still charged me for the $300 minimum on my credit card. I was pretty much stuck between a rock and a hard place. So, I let it go and proceed to enjoy my Birthday. The staff was super slow. Justin the ""VIP Host"" was super rude. Oh yea, so as I am leaving to my car the waitress runs me down talking about I have a tab for $50 and we didn't meet the $300 minimum. Now, between 12 people everyone's tab was well over $55 EACH how did we NOT hit the minimum? Plus, my guests bought my drinks so how did I have a $50 tab? Oh yea, the waitress once again ran and got Justin when she chased me outside and brought him to my car because I told her once again that the lady at the door said that all of the cover charges would b deducted from the tab. Justin told me that I wasn't told that and he is not talking to me anymore and turned his back to me. (Issue #3) My friend just ended up paying for it but I will be calling today to talk to a Manager about all the discrepancies.

Whenever my in-laws visit town, they always wind up at the Sandbar and tell us how great it is. Except for that one time - you know, the time they got food poisoning. Despite this, my in-laws have been back several times and recently invited my husband and myself to join them. To put it mildly, I was a little hesitant.

First and foremost, Sandbar gets its name from the outside bar they have with actual sand and cabanas. Some of the bar top tables are surf boards and everything is extremely colorful and tropical seeming. Not relaxing tropical, but party tropical with loud music blaring. When I had to go inside to the restroom, I gagged on the sewage smell and almost passed out from the color scheme. Everything is multicolored - the tables, the chairs, the walls. Oh god. So colorful. 

The actual food was decent but I'll admit, I didn't eat much. The group ordered two of their triple dip - which is some white queso dip (tastes like melted down Cheetos and not in a good way), a refried bean dip (meh), and some guacamole (eh-okay). The chips come in a metal beer bucket which is supposedly bottomless. Now, I'm not sure if we ordered salsa or if it was free, but it was just mediocre as well. Someone was crazy enough to order the coconut shrimp, the ancho ribs, and the honey jalapeno chicken wings. You can order the wings boneless, which we did, but those just turned out to be popcorn chicken drenched in sauce. Not a winner-winner, chicken-dinner. As for the ribs, they were okay - again heavy on the sauce.
 
I was hesitant to order a drink, since I'm more of a mixed cocktail sort of girl and nothing looked amazing. (What can I say, I'm really picky when it comes to liquor.) My in-laws and other relatives ordered beer and wine, which seemed great to them. The waiter was quick to fill up a glass and bring out fresh bottles. 

Overall, it wasn't terrible but I won't be back on my own volition. I'm sure there are plenty of people that love the Sandbar (especially my in-laws) but it is definitely not my kind of restaurant or bar."	5.0

The second (and final) time we went, we were told we would have to wait 40 mins for a table unless we found a bar table. We found one, then were told we couldn't sit there because some people were on their way to claim it. We sat there dumbfounded for a few minutes, then left.
Maybe all of this is excusable if the hostesses and servers were at least polite about it. But to be honest, almost everyone working here is the rudest individual anyone would ever hope to meet. Idk.

   We are hungry and have to wait for her to come back on the side were on so we can grab a menu. I have to call her over and ask for menus.

   We decided it would be better to sit at a table since we had people joining us. Our friends come and we go to wait at the table to order drinks (by this time our beers are empty too). We wait for 15 minutes before I start to wonder if they have servers, or if the servers come over here. I go up to the bar and ask if there is a server. She says yes and sends her over.

    I order the mac and cheese. Late night menu- it says ""mac and cheese, with jalapenos and toasted breadcrumbs."" I get my small $8 bowl of mac and cheese which had NO jalapenos and NO breadcrumbs. The server said the breadcrumbs were mixed in and that's why I couldnt see them (That was a lie). I didnt notice that there were also NO jalepenos until I actually started eating it. I have never been so disappointed about bar food before! And the server didnt care at all.

   From then on we got served drinks in a timely manner, but our dirty dishes stayed on the tiny table the whole night until we requested the check.  There were four of us, who came in at 2 separate times,  and the server had us all on one check! Pain in my ass. You should know that people always want seperate checks when drinking at the bar and keep it seperate from the beginning.  

This Is a description of my last visit to sandbar,  but the rest of my visits are just as bad. 

The good: (and the only reason I am giving two stars)
-$2 dos xx drafts on Tuesdays.
- DJ on tuesdays. Impressive. Nice music selection.
-Corn hole, if it isnt being hogged all night by the same two people.
 -Taco bar outside on weekends.

The bad:
-Service
-Prices (except dos xx on tues!)
-Food 
-How am I supposed to dance in sand?
-Rude bartenders
-Management (because clearly this is all a result of poor management)"	7.0

I talked to a manager and didn't even offer to buy a round of drinks or take care of us at all. It's like they don't care and all that takes to serving is to look pretty.

The margaritas were amazing (try the prickly pear). Caveats-traffic. LOUD traffic. Server was completely lacking a personality. Some of the worst ""Mexican"" food I have ever had. Excessive cilantro on everything. Cold queso dip appetizer that we sent back, only to get more cold queso dip with disgusting lumps of burned cheese in it. Spanish rice tasted like some ""minute rice"" 50's mom nonsense, and the beans could have been spackle for all the flavor they had.

The service is terrible, I had the most ditzy girl ever, she was not friendly and was spending her time flirting with other guys. I can see management only hired her for her looks obviously... I ordered a chicken burrito, came back with a steak burrito. She took too long to check back on us so I ended up starting to eat it simply because I was too hungry to wait 30 minutes for her to stop talking to the guys she was eating food off of. Then I mentioned that I asked for a chicken burrito, and she said she could only give me 15% off when there was clearly over half the plate still full. Then we asked to split the check in half because we shared an appetizer(which was full because it tasted poorly also) and she was unable to do it. I've been to many places and they are able to split the check in half.

We noticed that one said reserved at 6pm so when 7pm came around we asked if we could take that table....nope shot down real quick. So we waited a little longer still no table available but there were 5-6 tables empty around us. The staff did inform us if we wanted to order food at the bar we could hold our plates.....so we ordered some food and took our plates to the table reserved that said 6pm. We order just about $100 worth of food and the waitress said when the party arrives we need to leave it is the owners table Let just say the party never arrived and I will never give them my business again.

Today, when I arrived with a group for a business meeting, we found ourselves waiting for a long time for anyone to come over, we eventually had to flag someone over to us.

The kicker was, we had to do it many times before the ""hostess"" (don't say waitress,  it seems they get offended by it) came over.

Once there, she lied to us. Saying, that we needed to wait to get seated, and that the place we had decided to seat our ourselves at, is a $200 reserved table. Yeah, I did not buy that. Especially seeing that this place is not exactly a high end restaurant and the table was located outside in the baking Sun.

My boss decided what the hell, he will pay the $200 and it should not be a issue, since nobody is using this table anyway. Instead of accepting the money, the awful and very rude waitress... Sorry I mean hostess, made it clear she's not accepting our money and walked away. And there we sat.

After, a few minutes we decided we're just gonna leave, seeing that we're not getting any service. 

However, before we did, my boss and a fellow co worker went to talk with the manager and found out, that they do not reserve those tables and that we are allowed to see ourselves wherever we want.

I can only assume she had some kind of personal issue with us.

Today we walked in and a nice lady asked where we wanted to sit while a lady next to her was on the phone, the lady got off the phone and stated that there is a $300 per table today. I informed her that I called earlier (for this exact reason) and asked if their was going to be a cover or additional cost today because it was Super Bowl and I was informed that their was not. She stated with a additude that they had just decided it because they are getting so many reservations. $300 for a small round table that fits 2 people smh... we are getting ready to spend about $300 on food and drinks the entire time.

After waiting for about 20 minutes we finally received the salad,  oh and really with cheese. So I sent it back and they made me another great it came about 10min later and all that was on it this time was some chicken roasted corn lettuce tomato.  The food server asked if it was good this time.  I politely let them know that it was missing a few things like, avocado, jicama and bacons his time so back it went. It's just a simple salad. So it came back again , all almost there. It was missing this time chicken , and roasted corn but, they put all these big carrot slices that was not supposed to be on this salad. They brought the chicken no corn. So finally 
Came the corn not roasted but cold out of a can. What a lasting impression. a manager came over apologized and offered a Dessert.

But I AM happy, usually...until I come here. Literally, every time I've been to Sandbar, I've made the kind of promise to myself to never return that I actually intend to keep. I've personally witnessed hyper-aggressive bouncers use criminal levels of violence on non-violent patrons. You won't care about that because you're coming here anyway. You have no choice. Sandbar choke-slammed every other bar in Desert Ridge face-first into a fence and beat them into unconsciousness. 

So get ready to rub elbows with assholes, the kind who think that drive WAY out east to Tatum is close enough to be Scottsdale. They have two kinds of music at Sandbar, loud hip-hop and loud ""club"" hip-hop. I'm talking about that kind of experimentation where the DJ has to prove he can mix two songs on top of one another, with some repeating sirens, whistles and air horns to show you he's serious about his craft. If you're over 16, you'll hate it too. But you're going to Sandbar anyway, right?

Where else can drunk teachers and drunker students scream their incomprehensible drink orders at incomprehensible bartenders together? If this were a beach bar in Amity, I'd rather hit the water and take my chances with a certain great white. You can explain that reference to the other 98% of Sandbar's clientele when you get here. They won't get it even if they could hear you. 

You could always rent a cabana. That is, if you don't have actual rent or a mortgage to be concerned about. In those, I've been told the ""music"" is even louder. I've been here when it's packed and I've been here when it's empty, but the decibel level is like the blind lady of justice: she ruins it for everyone, equally and harshly.

I'd rather hit Omaha Beach on June 6th, 1944 than Sandbar on any given night.

I understand that bars stop serving at 2 AM.  It's not right that the security guards here rudely yelled at all their paying patrons on a Saturday night  ""everyone get out!! we want to go home!!""  

I quickly pay, leave and find out there's a 20 min wait to get an uber. I go back to the entrance and ask the 3 security guards sitting in chairs in the front if I could quickly use the restroom before my uber gets there.  I was rudely denied. One security guard asked "" how long will it take"" I respond by saying less than a minute. The Security guard said ""that's too long sorry"".  4 security guards sitting nearby laughed and made a joke out of. Pretty unreal that grown men would act that way.  

Fast forward 2 months and Myself and 6 colleagues come here for happy hour. Two belligerently drunken bro-type dudes ask if they can sit at the end of our 8 person table.  We politely tell them it's cool, no ones sitting there.  There were plenty of open seats everywhere in the bar so we found it a bit weird that they would want to sit with us. 

To keep it short, they were a nuisance and were being provocative to us. 

I see a security guard come to the table to talk to them and I'm thinking great they are getting kicking out for being obviously too intoxicated.   Nope!  The security guard gave them hugs and they knew each other.  Figures!

We all left shortly after and took our business somewhere else."	2.0

We were there for 10 minutes, I couldn't even finish one drink, that's how quickly this happened. All of the sudden the bouncers approached my friend who was standing directly next to me and watching the tvs and doing nothing. They asked him to follow them out and walked him to the parking lot and said he was acting like he was overserved.He was sober. He was doing nothing. He is, however, brown. An MIT and Stanford educated Doctor, who happens to be Indian, and sober, but he got kicked out. This is the most disgusting display of racism. This bar is awful. Meanwhile, I'm a blonde girl who was actually less sober than I should have been and proceeded to yell at them, all the way out the bar. I didn't get kicked out. L	3.0

The mango margarita I ordered tasted like a regular margarita from a big frozen mixer and was pretty damn small for $8 bucks. Enjoyed the queso and my meal, however I was pretty turned off by the service. Unfortunately you're not being waited on by experienced customer service oriented waiters. You're being waited on by a cute little twenty-something in a pair of skimpy shorts who runs by your table asking ""how is everything"" and doesn't stop or slow down to hear your answer. So am I going there for the ""five star"" service? No. But if you want a busy hang out where you can get some over priced drinks and a decent tex-mex meal, Sandbar will work."	1.0

The drunk patron next to us was so loud I couldn't even hear myself talk. The food was sub-par at best and the portions were extremely small. The waitress, while friendly, was almost non-existent. Other than taking our order, she stopped back one other time, we asked for an additional condiment, and it took several more minutes before she meandered back to us.

I joined staff from the company I work for at an End of Summer Celebration on 9/6/13 from 3-6PM.  The food was excellent, the atmosphere on the patio was acceptable.  It was still a tad too warm out to be on the patio IMHO.  I asked our very inattentive server for an ice water with my beer when I first got there.  They brought the beer pretty quickly but I had to ask again almost 45 minutes later for the water.  When I ordered a second frothy beverage shortly after finally getting my glass of water, it took forever and they brought me the wrong brand.  (The place wasn't that busy) By that time I was hot, tired, and pissed, so I decided to take the opportunity to go home just before 5PM.  The company was good, but the service sucked beyond words.

The place is spacious so regardless of what time you arrive you usually are  able to find a seat. The problem I had is that I was nickeled and dimed for everything without them even mentioning that there was a charge. For example if you want to add a flavor in your margarita it's a whole dollar extra it is not stated anywhere on the menu nor did the server care to tell me. We also got fajitas and were served three tiny tortillas with it and when I asked for just a couple more tortillas we were brought them but not told that we were going to be charged for them we only ate one of the second amount of tortillas they brought us yet we were charged $1.50 extra. If you want to charge for every little thing and every added thing that is fine but either your menu needs to state it or the server needs to tell you I spent almost $10 additional and little extra fees at this place tonight. Oh I almost forgot I got the guacamole to start it was pretty much flavorless and despite me letting my server know that I didn't care for it not only was I not offered a replacement I was still charged for it. I will be pretty hard-pressed to return to this location	0.0

This was a different kind of loud. I could not hear my husband sitting 12 inches away from me. Even my teen kids were holding their ears. It was seriously WAY TOO LOUD. My ears were ringing when I left. I ordered the mexican pizza that cost me $10 and was literally a burned tortilla with beans, meat and lettuce. That was it.

My $10 cheese enchiladas were terrible. They were tiny. The cheese was obviously frozen grated because it didn't melt as much as flatten.  Chewy, icky. The red sauce was really odd, sweet. The black beans were slipped on the plate and thrown into the salamander. The juice was cooked all over the side of the plate.  The margarita was ok, but for $7 I expect something more than a plastic glass with a rough edge.  We had $3 iced tea and were never offered refills.  And it was empty within 10 mins of it being sat on the table it was so small. $36 for this meal was painful to pay.  Never again.	1.0

I then had to wait for close to 20 minutes as bartenders walked by and ignored me before I finally was able to exchange my drink for a beer- which by the way I was charged the full price of the margarita ($8) because the bartenders were too lazy to fix my order. Oh and I didn't even get an apology and the bartender seemed burdened that I was asking for a replacement. The crowed was a odd bunch off people and I could tell that most of them were not from Desert Ridge but probably from the west side. A lot of older douchey guys who think their still 19.

Our choices are limited so I'm usually stuck with here or Salty's in Glendale, which is just a blast from my high school past that I'd like to ignore. Believe me, the choice makes me want to gauge my eyes out too.

It was packed because of the UFC game when I went and you could hardly get around the sausage fest with everyone awkwardly standing and roaring, let alone try to wave down a bartender to get you a drink. When you did though, I will say that the girls are extremely nice, attentive, and quick. Does it overcome the horror when I see how much it costs for just a couple of drinks? Unfortunately not. Definitely a place where you'll have to get a little skeezy if you want something other than H20. Friends were telling me that it gets better when the music turns because everyone actually starts moving around, but the UFC fight had just barely started and I was dreading standing around in heels in the cold with the outdoor heaters not doing any favors for me. 

As if on cue though, someone from above felt the pain in my calves and SIlva's career died in front of my very eyes. The UFC crowd left and music began. Crowd consists mostly of MILFS and ordinary looking guys who come alone dancing by themselves hoping for something, if anything. Definitely an extremely milder version of Mill with a male to female ratio of 3:1. Good dance music though, played a lot of 2000's hip hop. 

Can't judge on food as I didn't get any, but I'd say that it's worth the extra money and time to go somewhere else or end up awkwardly standing next to a Mexican statue trying to get a drink for the next 15 minutes."	1.0

Great chips and salsa, glad they finally expanded the beer selection to add some decent craft brews, and the patio is nice as long as it isn't wall to wall and that crappy DJ doesn't have his less than desirable music to loud.

The rest, I could take or leave. The food is very average, bordering on poor, compared to other Mexican places. Based on that point, very over priced for the quality. When they first got the craft brews, the good Happy Hour prices applied, now they don't. What gives? Every other place in town will honor Happy Hour prices for all drinks, including crafts.  Weekend evenings are way to crowded, for my taste.

12:10: arrived and ordered drinks
12:18: received drinks 
12:19: ordered food
12:49: appetizer #1 (wings) delivered, also told by wait staff that they only had 1 burger patty left (the place was completely empty, it was not busy at all) and that they also did not have ""beef"" for the gyro

12:58: person #3 food delivered ""just kidding, we have beef for the gyro""
13:00: person #4 food delivered (pizza special)
13:25: check received

I had a burger, it was awful. The worst symphony of flavors I have ever tasted masked by spice. I was hungry and couldn't even eat more than half of my food. The fries were good though...

The gyro meat, looked like a shoe tonque that was lit on fire and not meat.

The pizza looked like Red Baron, for being a ""special"" I'm not sure why it took 40 minutes to be served... I think we all know how they get away with the price for all you can eat. It would take 3 hours to eat 6 pieces of pizza and no one would want to be sitting in this place for that long.

I don't know what the appeal is... this is supposed to be a bar. NOTHING to look at. Even if I drank enough to have beer goggles.. I would struggle in finding anything even remotely appealing. What I am saying is, this is the worst restaurant I have ever been to that is still open."	4.0

It wasn't very busy and the servicewas very slow. Waiting 10+minutes for drinks and 30+minutes for 2 slices of pizza. I can clearly see that this is old pizza. There was a layer of old cheese, topped with a small layer of fresh cheese to make it look good. As a server myself, there is no way in hell I would let this go out to my tables.

We literally had to ask for everything, lemon and salt for our beers, etc. We eventually ordered a white pizza. Ok, not better than zellas $5 cheesy bread! Once he brought our bill, i asked if they offered military discounts, but perhaps he didn't hear us, even when i yelled it over the bar. Once he returned with our CC, i asked again.

They tasted like cough syrup ewwww, well the manager came over and got those drinks fixed which it was kudos but why would we pay for them if in the first place they where nasty, the ones that he fixed should of been a complimentary after all we where going to spend more money. Well My friend and i order vodka with redbull which guess what they ran out of redbull (fkn bs) well after that i order another drink as my friends and i walked out to the patio i saw the manager and just making simple convo i asked him about being out of redbull and he answer me back with an attitude which wasnt cool on top of that he told my friend that if she wanted whipcream and a cherry on her piña colada she should of order (like wtf other bars they give it to you or asked you,  which none of those happen)....Well as we went outside and the manager saw that my friends took their drinks with them to the patio meaning that we weren't leaving just yet, which he thought we where gonna leave without paying, because after we where outside he send the waitress to check up on us and how do I know, because she was in front of my friends and I telling him over the headset""yes they are out here"" like are you fucken kidding you fucken douche bag......To me that's what killed the whole thing, I was gonna give you good ratings but because you couldn't tell your employee to be more freaken discreet killed the hole fucken thing......So if you guys want to be treated like your not going to pay, because your out in the patio just hanging out don't go to this pleace.

We had the sample platter (app) A supreme pizza & honey hot wings. All typical bar food material.  This place is in a strip mall & is very dark inside.

In the words of the late, great, Rick James, ""I wish I had two more hands so I could give this restaurant four thumbs down!""

It all began with a trip to the neighboring Vietnamese restaurant which a friend noted had decent food. Of course, this place was randomly closed on a Wednesday in the summer. I am not in tune with Vietnamese culture, but I can only imagine that something more important than running your business is happening on a Wednesday, in the summer, in order to be closed. We decide to wander over to Gus's Pizza, complete with the unnecessary ""s"". We take our seats right around noon. About five minutes later we are asked if we want a soda, no option for Iced Tea or water at the time, just simply, soda. Two Iced Tea's, a Coke, and a ""Cherry"" Coke later, we decide to order appetizers. It's roughly 12:19pm when we place our order as follows:

-One 10 piece order of 'hot' wings
-One Special (all you can eat pizza, single topping slices, $4.95)
-One Fire Burger, Medium, with Fries.
-One Fire Burger, Medium, with Onion Rings.
-One Chicken Gyro, with Fries.

Ten minutes pass before the waitress informs us that they only have one patty and two burger orders. I forfeit my burger and choose the Beef Gyro. Five minutes later, I hear an ""Oh shit"" in the background. The waitress returns informing me there is not any beef for the beef gyro and suggests a chicken gyro, I pass. 

12:40pm 

-First drink refill received

12:49pm

-Hot wings order received

12:54pm

-One Fire Burger Received

12:58pm

-Chicken Gyro Received
-Side of Onion Rings Received

1:03pm

-Magically, some beef gyro meat was found. My gyro was delivered and I was informed that I would not be charged for the gyro or onion rings.

1:07pm

-Two slices, one pepperoni, one sausage, received.

I'll point out a couple of things if they weren't already obvious.

A pizza joint, which has pizza in the title of the business, should probably have pizza ready during lunch hour, especially when offering an ""all-you-can-eat"" special. I found it strange that the pizza was delivered last.

As far as the missing beef, it brings me back to the Burger King commercials from the 1980's, ""Where's the beef??"" - well, had I known it would taste as it did, I'd be asking, ""Where's the door?"" To their defense, the place was not known as Gus's Pizza, Burgers, and Gyros. 

With the exception of the wings, which were fairly decent, the gyro meat looked and tasted microwaved. The burger, which I tried a small sample of, reminded me of reheated cafeteria food - the kind you would get from public grade schools. 

The onion rings were over fried and the fries were showered in salt (not the quick shower, better related to the long showers where your mom questions why the water bill was so high last month.)

Our bill, less the comped gyro and onion rings was just shy of $39. We split it four ways. I tipped a hair over 20%, mainly because the waitress was polite, despite the quality of the food or slow service. Also because it is the first and last bit of money they will ever receive from me. 

Thanks for the experience."	8.0

I was told the driver couldn't find my apartment so he had left?? So I told them again where my apartment was. About 8 pm, I get another call saying the delivery man can't find my apartment, and the manager promises to take 25% off my bill. Finally the delivery guy calls me, and I have to walk out and guide him to my apartment, which is located in the building number I gave them when I ordered. He offers some lame excuse about looking at every other building in the complex, then assures me that his boss will take care of me regarding the bill. I give him a generous tip for his trouble and he leaves. The Pizza is so-so, the wings are lukewarm. The manager never takes anything off the bill and the full amount is charged. I don't even like waiting two hours for excellent pizza, so this was just depressing, and then we had to pay the full amount anyways. So yeah, I'll never order from here again. The dumbest part of the whole experience is this: we called this pizza place because they left a flyer on the door of our apartment. I just figured if they could find it once, they could find it again to deliver our pizza. Boy, was I wrong!! You can get far better pizza with much less drama. Might as well pass on this place.	0.0

We couldn't believe that we were overlooked because there was only one person seated at the bar and 2 tables outside. We ordered Applebees online,waited left $10 with a 50 cent tip for the waitress.

I'd like to start off by saying I have had a long day at work and didn't want to cook dinner this evening. Seeing posts all day on my Facebook about how gus's had tacos for taco Tuesday made my husband and my choice easy. We placed an order for delivery for 16 tacos and a 2 liter of soda, totalling $30, still worth not having to cook.
Placing the order I was told it would be 45 mins to an hr, after an hour and 10 minutes I received a phone call from gus's stating that I had not answered the door and the delivery guy had left already, I told her I have some very loud dogs who freak out every time anyone even walks up to our door and they had not moved a muscle. She said she would call the delivery guy and tell him to try to redeliver. When he finally showed up he told my husband that his GPS had taken him to a different street. 
When we opened up our boxes of tacos the tortillas were hard and cold, the meat was ice cold also and the tacos were tossed around inside the box, far from the delicious pictures I'd seen on Facebook earlier. So I called the store and was given a manager who agreed to replace our order this time with pizza and wings and apologized for the inconvenience. However I'd have to wait 45 mins to an hr again for delivery. This time the food showed up an 45 minutes later, hot. Yay! But forgot my 2 liter, I again had to call the store. Now, 30 minutes later I've finally been given my missing soda. I'm exhausted and going to bed. I wouldn't recommend ordering tacos from here especially for delivery, there's tons of options for taco Tuesday and I think I've learnt my lesson and will venture out instead of getting delivery."	5.0

Since it was still morning in Phoenix and would be dinner whenever we arrived at our destination I figured that taking lunch onto the plane would be prudent.  Since we were leaving out of C7 we perused the options near our gate and ultimately settled on Los Taquitos.  Since it is in located in an airport there isn't much to say about it other than the it has a place to order as well as a decent amount of seating.  I decided to head to the restaurant about 35 minutes before our flight giving myself plenty of time.  It took a little less that 10 minutes to get through the line and I ended up ordering two chicken burritos and gave them my name.  Then we stood and waited and waited some more.  While I can't fault the people behind the counter, all of whom were hustling, I saw quite a few people on my flight leave without getting their food.  Thankfully I was in the B boarding group and 27 minutes after ordering received my food.  That is criminal for an airport and it gave me just enough time to get into line at the gate.  So now you are probably wondering whether the food was worth the wait.  I can certainly tell you it was not.  Both of the burritos came with refried beans and some rice on the side.  They were both ok but I think the most disappointing part about my meal was the burrito itself.  While I had ordered a chicken burrito I didn't actually get much chicken in it.  It was more refried bean than anything else and so perhaps they were rationing the chicken to push out more orders?  The only part of the meal that I enjoyed was the green salsa which had a good flavor.

The bottom line for me is that I wouldn't head back here again in the future.  Not only was the wait horrible, especially for an airport, but the food was incredibly disappointing as well."	0.0

I'm a card carrying, verified Los Taquitos addict, and know they've been here for a while. Decided to grab a bite on my way out to Albuquerque this afternoon to see how it compared to their Ahwatukee and Phoenix locations. 

If you're going to take anything way from my review, let it be this: This location is absolutely NOTHING like the flagship (if you don't count the food truck) locations.

Sure, the menu looks almost identical: Breakfast Burritos and Tortas, the infamous Street Tacos and Quesadillas. 

The food even looks the same. 

Yes, I realize this is airport food, but the only thing from a quality control standpoint that tastes the same are the roja y verde salsas. 

I went with the 3 Street Tacos Combo and a Large Water Bottle for a total of $12.13. 

The tortillas were sad and cold. 

The beans were playdoh-esque, cold and the rice had way way WAY too much seasoning. 

All of the meats were lukewarm. The Pollo was dry and crumbly, the Carne Asada lacked that vibrant spice we all know LT by, and the Carnitas were also missing that unique spice. 

I will say though, the Carnitas was the most moist of the three. 

Sad, wilted cilantro and onions were scattered on haphazardly. 

What a disappointment. This is one of my favorite taco places in town, and it's a shame they're misrepresenting their product here. 

This would have been a one star review if we're going off food quality only; however, the team was really hustling, the gal was taking orders was cheery, and the manager took time to chat with me.

If a Taco Bell and Del Taco burrito taste around the same for about half the price you know there's a problem. There's much much better options at Sky Harbor

I was able to order quickly but it took a long time for my food to come up which consistence of a steak quesadilla and some hot sauce.  Some vegetables with this would have been awesome.  I think it was supposed to come with pico de gallo.  Also, a smear of guac could have really livened this dish up.  Heck, some lettuce and tomatoes inside the quesadilla would have been good too.

Outside of that, the line was an absolute mess.  The way food was being served across the line there was cross contamination of ingredients everywhere.  For example, I can't do cheese but there was literally cheese everywhere, in everything.

Too bad I was craving a chicken burrito with almost no chicken. It was more like a refried bean and cheese burrito. All I tasted was tortilla with their watery tasting beans.

My friends and I weren't PLANNING on finishing the boxed wine but hey, these things just happen right?

Expensive small tea that's over filled with ice and they don't do refills, salsa had no flavor, and the little soup cup they bring tastes like watered down canned tomato soup with some hot sauce dumped in it. Camarones ahogados were overbearing in seasoning and it looked like they had dumped half a bottle of salsa on it, couldn't even taste the shrimp, not to mention all the seafood was room temperature, Gross! The rice tastes like a box Parmesan rice mix and the molcajete was twice the price and half the size (no exaggeration) from every other place Ive ever had it.  No greeting when you enter, and staff looked like they hated being there. Left my empty drink on the edge of the table and waitress acted like it wasn't there for half the visit.

Got a steak and cheese.Paid extra for more mushrooms and got 1 sliver and a half of a mushroom, two slivers of a pepper, and a few slivers of onions. Peppers and mushrooms  were razor thin. When I saw how stingy they were with the vegetables I asked them politely if they could put extra.With the look of disgust,they replied 50 Cent,50cent.For a second I thought the rapper 50 Cent had walked into the food court, but then realized they were just trying to get $.50 more out of me for something I had already paid for.
I then told him I had already paid extra and he replied,that's the recipe I can't change it!
That's when I looked at him with the same disgusted face that he gave me, and said quite loudly, you are ripping me off, and I want my money back.It was only then, in embarrassment, that he added a slightly bit more of the vegetables that I had already paid for.
Is this what it takes to get good service these days?

This is the third time now that I've gone to this Burger King and ordered a croissant breakfast sandwich with sausage and this is the third time I have gotten ham instead. It's not a very big deal since I do like ham and it tastes all the same anyway when I'm eating quick fast food on my way to work, but it does get annoying after a while. The first time it happened, I looked at the wrapping around the sandwich after I'd realized it was ham and it was labeled ham. So the second time I made sure to look at the wrapping when they gave me my food and it was marked sausage so I thought I was good and it turned out to be ham anyway. This third time I asked when they gave me to the food to make sure it was sausage because the past two times it's been ham, and sure enough they said it was my correct order and that they checked it and I received ham again.

I called this location to let them know that this is the third time... Not to complain to them, but to at least let them know that this is happening in their drive-thru and if it's happened to me 3 times, I'm sure it's happened to many other customers. I talked to the manager and was put on hold and then the call disconnected... Or else they hung up on me.

To start with, the ""seasoned"" burger resembled a thick piece of cardboard in both taste and texture. This was topped with soggy shredded lettuce, a flaccid slice of tomato, and a barely detectable dab of buffalo sauce. The creamy ranch dressing and shaved red onion? Non-existent.  Supposedly coupling this culinary disaster were ""seasoned"" fries (when I asked what they were seasoned with, the response was salt and pepper), and a pickle spear (also forgotten).

We seated ourselves on the patio area and it would be several minutes before our server Josh appeared. I told him that we were celebrating my brother and his new wife married that afternoon.  Josh responded rather sarcastically  ""Good luck"". We were all a little stunned by this remark. I don't remember my exact response but it was something like ""at least pretend to be happy for them"". Josh held up his left hand to show his wedding band and told us ""I'm married ... Good luck"".  Wow. What a crappy server. You have marriage troubles? So sorry, but don't project your negativity and sarcasm on someone else's happy day. Fake it till you make it, buddy. 
We ordered drinks but never got a glass of water as you would receive in every other American restaurant. 
We ordered our food and I think ended up putting for a second round of drinks at the same time. It was at this point hat Josh seemed to try to turn it around. All of the sudden he was trying to be friendly - saying he would ensure our drinks were perfect blah blah. 
Food comes along....Ho hum. My brother had the salmon with veggies. You know those frozen mixed vegetables that come in the microwaveable steamer bags by Green Giant? Yeah, he got those. At least that's what the side looked like to me. I had tomato, onion and green pepper fajitas with some shrimp- oh wait, sorry, ""Shrimp fajitas"" is how they were advertised on the menu. With Mission brand flour tortillas. My boyfriend's Cuban sandwich looked good but he only shrugged when I asked how it tasted. That was the general consensus amongst all of us: the food was ""Meh"". My boyfriend quipped ""Coco's by any other name..."" 
So We brought in a little cake and Josh is trying to be ""Super Friendly Helpful Server"" now and offered to bring us plates and even offered to cut the cake for us. I guess he finally realized his tip was on the line. I recognize that he did try salvage his service but it was too little too late. 
In the end we had a $200 bill, half was drinks. The drinks were good. The food was overpriced,  bland fare comparable to Coco's. The service was a little slow. It was a Sunday afternoon, no Big Game was on, not crowded. We weren't in a rush or anything, but it just added to the poor experience. 
Hope Josh gets some job and marriage counseling to help with his attitude. As for us, we will never, ever return to JD's."	1.0

 To our disappointment there was really nothing to choose from. 2 slices of pepperoni pizza, a taco bar, a full salad bar, a couple pieces of meat loaf and some old fried chicken. They were not busy when we arrived either and there were just a few people dining at the time. 

 They call themselves the Old Country Buffet but, nothing country about it. Mashed potatoes were instant, no fried okra, no bbq the list goes on. Everything they had was old and cold sitting in the window for who knows how long? We were there for an hour and the only thing that came out fresh was a pan of orange chicken. That whole pan of fresh orange chicken was then taken  by the family at the table in front of ours. Yes, literally the entire pan of it. The staff that pick up your old plates were very friendly though.  
  
 We will never eat here again due to lack of selection and poor food quality. It was a rip off at $42.39 for 2 adults and 2 children. Very disappointed in the selection of menu items! We will be way better off going to the Golden Corral from now on. The Golden Corral has a much better selection of menu items to choose from!

If you plan to go there and check it out for yourself, I highly recommend that you take your own plates, silverware and glasses. I searched for a very long time, for a clean plate and silverware.  It's like they must be using cheap dish washer detergent that doesn't quite rinse from items and leaves streaks, smears and dirt. 

I was also surprised to find that the food was cold, despite being under hot lights.  This almost killed my appetite and I found myself looking for a microwave, to no avail.  The macaroni and cheese was watery and reminded me of Kraft boxed macaroni, along with being possibly mixed with cheese soup.  The pizza was bland, and the fat hadn't been pulled from the fried chicken.  The cantaloupe tasted bland, although the nachos were crisp and you were offered a variety of fillings, i.e. refried beans, hamburger, cheese, etc. The chicken nuggets were ok, if that's your thing.  The short ribs, while seasoned nicely, had very little meat.  It was like eating neckbones.  The best thing that I ate were the beef stew and a side serving of strawberry covered bananas.  The meat was tender, not too stringy and tasted marvelous. I was disappointed with the cheese cake, as it reminded me of jello.  I would've tried something else, but was stuffed after sampling a little bit of everything.  Overall, I was surprised there weren't better and more plentiful choices. I expect a restaurant's food to taste better than what I make at home.  Sadly, this was not the case and I felt that the price paid $11.29@ was exorbitant. Thank God I didn't opt for the soda (an additional fee), as I've grown tired of sugary replicas. 

The waitress was courteous and overwhelmingly helpful, although since I fixed my own plate, what else did she have to do other than clear empty plates? I didn't expect to have to tip for that.  The bathroom was clean and no lingering odors were prevalent.

By that time, the ""Dinner"" prices replaced ""Breakfast"" prices, increasing by almost $4.00 a person, bringing our bill up by over $24 more than had she simply rang us up.

When I got to the drinks bar, there were no coffee mugs whatsoever. I called an attendant and they immediately brought some from the back, but when I picked one up to use, I found old drink residue left within, along with lipstick marks. My next two cups fared the same. 

Finally, they replaced the cups with clean ones, but when I reached the coffee machines, they were all empty. FOUR COFFEE BREWERS IN A BUFFET WERE EMPTY. 
So, I went over to the iced tea brewers, and poured myself a glass. To my surprise, i found coffee mixed with the tea! When I told the manager of all my troubles, he assured me I must be mistaken. I poured out my cup and showed him the bottom where both coffee grounds and tea leaves could be found, to which he scoffed and said I must have mixed them myself. He called me a liar in front of my own family! 

After I calmed down, I went to get another plate of food and found there were no forks left in the holding cups, just spoons and knives. I figured it was understandable, since the place was a bit packed. The same manager was there, refilling the plate trays, and I addressed my concern. He went on a short rant about how they were full that day and couldn't keep up, it was hard to focus on any one task needed, and he'd send somebody over later on.

As we tried to gather our lunch the coffee cups were all beat up and had a weird white film on them.  They had plates (took 4 to find a clean one) but only a few folks were left and most were dirty.  Nothing was equipped any where. Desert area had no ice cream bowls or spoons on either side.  Many of the food bins had no food in them, or just a dried up dab in the corner.  None of the food was really hot, and chicken bin had 3 dried up pieces laying there.  Salad dressings were that weird slimy consistency.  Lots of dirty tables, and lots of junk on the floors. Some of the deserts had been sitting a long time and were dried up or weeping......     We sort of nibbled a little this or that (what was at the right temp) and left.  Won't be going back again.	1.0

They have changed their pricing structure so dinner for 2 was almost $30. For that amount of money I expect a positive dining experience. Not so here. They do have a new pot pie on the menu, and it was really good, but they never replenished it in the 60 minutes we sat inside the restaurant. They also added a cheeseburger to their menu that no one even touched. There was no one behind the meat-cutting counter, the deserts were incomplete, the front of the restaurant was messy and Jason, the manager, was texting the entire time we were there. The restaurant is cold (so cold we went out to the car to get our heavy coats) and it's no fun any more. Thinking about taking your family out to dinner at Old Country Buffet? Think again.	0.0

I went right back up to the counter and asked to speak to the manager, who was sitting at a table eating. I told him I wanted a refund because I would be taking my business elsewhere: the bathrooms were disgusting, and if the bathrooms were that bad, I couldn't imagine how bad the kitchen must be! Without a word, he refunded my money with no apology, no promise to check out the problem, nothing. Terrible! 

I have worked in food service and I know how difficult it can be to keep up on everything, and I know everyone has off-days, but the type of filth I saw and smelled was the kind that were indicative of an ongoing problem.

It was a Friday night I'm thinking it would have been packed like it was before but I notice the parking was not full hmmm...so we walked in and I looked around and it was not busy and it was about 7pm. I notice the price when up $13+ but I figure eh no biggie.  So we went to grab our food and the first thing I usually grab was there steak, umm they don't make steak?? They had roast beef instead umm okay :/ so they usually make great pot roast, what no pot roast either?? The food looked pathetic on the buffet lines, the labels for food on the top didn't even match the food wtf??? I walked over to grab some rice and it was low and I saw the worker bringing more rice, so I was like great right? He dumped it in and mixed the rice that has been in there for awhile which I don't have a problem but the old rice in there was freaking crunchy like old stale rice!! I was embarrassed because my family was not impress! The only good thing came out of this was there dessert, well except the yogurt ice cream! What happen to the real ice cream that was there before?? The waitress said, ""how's everything""? and I said, what happened here it was good before? She just apologized and didn't want to say to much but you could tell she knew a lot of customers wasn't that happy. I will never eat here again unless they bring the food quality back like it was before! Do the business not know they are declining? Hopefully you are reading this OCB and do something about it!

Went tonight for the first time in a while. Drinks are no longer included in the price. It was the one advantage they had over Golden Corral. But not anymore. Golden Corral's hot food is fresher and much better tasting. Old Country has a slightly better salad bar. 

The worst offender is the carving station. The roast beef is usually a dried out husk. Once or twice in the last decade was it actually pink in the middle. I guess the chef doesn't know roast beef shouldn't be well done. 

Tonight I had a coke, a small salad, some dried out roast beef with mashed potatoes, a piece of fried chicken, some zucchini, some acorn squash, and a piece of pecan pie. Not worth $16.

This should have been a sign to not go inside but we went in anyway.  Yep, big mistake!  We paid $14 each to get the buffet, and let's just say we should have taken that money straight to the homeless couple outside and said ""here feed me whatever you got in that fancy cart.""  Of course, they probably would have whipped up something better than what we found inside at the buffet.  

Food selection was all over the map, and everything had the lovely after-taste of stomach acid.  For being called ""Old Country Buffet"" there was a complete lack of ""country food"" options.  Most of the food bins were empty and at the carving station it looked like they were cutting up something that could only be found in small third world countries.  

I thought to myself, ""well the food is bad, but I'll fill up and get my moneys worth form the dessert bar.""  Wrong again!  The ice-cream machines were empty and the slice of carrot cake that I got had the texture of shag carpet ripped out of an old porn store from the 1970's.

The service was the worst I have seen - the waitress who seemed highly angry with the fact that we came in to the restaurant literally slammed down menus, water glasses (mine had a bug in it), and the yogurt/bagel that we ordered out of fear (after reading Yelp reviews once seated) that the service would be so slow we'd miss our plane. 
Everything seemed dirty, and the servers all seemed to have no concept of how to treat customers or take pride in anything they were doing. 
This was the first time in my life that I was tempted to not leave any tip at all (my conscience got the best of me), but in hindsight, I shouldn't have.

Before I start, I tend to give restaurant employees the benefit of the doubt and leniency when they are busy, as I worked in this industry for 10+ years. But this was unacceptable and must at least be known to you.

My boyfriend and I showed up right around 11am at sat at an empty table (no host staff at podium, no signage on whether to sit or wait to be seated). They were very busy, but we sat at a clean, empty table, and looked at the menu already there. The menu said breakfast ended at 11am, so we decided to order lunch. At around 11:07am, a server (Barbara) came up to us and asked how we were. We said, fine, and asked her the same. She said, ""wherever you're going, take me with you."" We nervously chuckled, and said we were ready to order. My boyfriend ordered an iced tea and a burger. As he ordered the burger, she said it was still breakfast and he couldn't order it. We informed her it was after 11. She got her phone out, looked at the time, and said, ""I have to ask,"" and walked away. We were a little confused, but figured she was coming right back after asking another employee. She didn't come back for another 6 minutes, and we watched her wandering around doing other things. I finally caught her eye and said excuse me. She looked at me and said, ""it is lunch time,"" and walked away. I was then getting annoyed. She finally came back at 11:15, grabbed the menu from the table, and started to walk away. Both my boyfriend and I said, we haven't ordered lunch yet. She then said, oh yes, what would you like? He again ordered a burger and iced tea, I then ordered the chicken strips and fries with a Diet Coke. She didn't write anything down, and asked what we wanted to drink. 

At this point I was very frustrated. It only got worse when about 5 minutes later, she walked up to me (way past when she should have had the order in, and frankly the food should have been about to come out of the kitchen), and said, you ordered chicken strips, right? I said yes, and she walked away. At this point it was approximately 11:35. Five or so minutes later, she came back out with one food basket...the burger. She said to me, ""the chicken strips take a little longer."" And, my boyfriend's burger had clearly been sitting in the window as the burger and fries were cold and the bun was as hard as a rock. That is when I went up to her at the register where she was and told her to forget the chicken strips and just give me the check for the burger and drinks. We paid $15.24 without eating any food, and left.

I would understand if the kitchen or the entire restaurant were having troubles this morning, but they weren't. There was another server there that waited on a table which sat down 30 seconds in front of us in her station. They had beers, food, and more beers by the time we ordered our lunch. The service we received was terrible, and on top of it, this was at an airport, where you do have an expectation that the staff understands you are under time constraints.

The waitress explained that they were backed up - so I waited a long time for a menu, for my food and for the correct bill. While waiting the waitress charged one table for their meal and the strangers beside them.  When I finally got my bill ($10 approx) I was instead handed a bill for 31$. She corrected it but that was pretty typical for the experience of everyone there. The bartender charged one woman 9$ for a white wine glass and then gave the next woman who came the exact same glass for 8$ and told her not to tell anyone about the ""inside price"". 
So basically it was not a place for a relaxing easy meal that day. The food was nothing to write home about.

Had one hour left so I decided to eat something at the Copper Plate grill. It was seat yourself - but apparently that also means you need to find your own menu? Took waitresses three go arounds to get me one.

First attempt to deliver me my food went wrong...but getting a waitress attention to get it resolved took some time.
Second attempt was still wrong, but given the fact that I was 50 minutes into the hour I had I gave up and decided to eat it.

Not great - lower end greasy and too much salt.

Service was horrible, no one came to check coals, the one girl (who has only been smoking hookah for a month tried to tell us it was us who were hitting wrong....like no, I've been smoking longer than you knew hookah even existed), hose was never replaced, still made us but drinks despite everything. Not to mention after the new management change everything is overpriced. Every party member ""must order or drink or everyone in your party is charged $2 each"" this didn't happen a year ago. Not sure why this is a new ""rule"" all of a sudden. But to be
 honest it's a waste of money especially because of the bad/trashy music. The ""music video"" in the VIP is a video of a CHURCH sermon. I simply do not recommend this place to anyone because of the new management. Should have gone to King Tut where they actually remember their guests and cater to them.

Only thing i dislike is that they use wood coals instead of standard coconut coals. One MAJOR problem is the service. They take forever to come around for new coals. Also they don't give you tongs to fix the coals yourself. So hopefully they dont burn out you hookah in 20 minutes like they did mine. But i have to say the environment is good.

Located at the Hilton Resort in Scottsdale, this alcove just off the main lobby suffers from a combination of overly ambitious menus and underwhelming service. Dinner, even at 7pm with just one other table seated, can be an ordeal. A harried looking waiter was pleasant, if distracted. The menu was scattered, covering salads to duck to fish. 

An intriguing starter dubbed 'Scorpion Prawns' were described as U-10 prawns (big suckers) tempura coated and served with a chipotle cream cheese. The prawns were much smaller, but quite tasty. Looking for something lighter, I went with the duck salad: slices of duck on top mixed greens with sliced green apples, crumbled Gorgonzola, and candied pecans, all tossed in lemon-champagne dressing. A good mix of flavoura and textures, though the duck was just south of room temperature and verging on 'cool'.

Breakfast the next morning wasn't a much better experience, with a larger crowd leading to a few errors in service. An order of a pomegranate smoothie arrived at the table as a fruit oatmeal and grapefruit juice was forgotten. What did land at the table was, however, a satisfying meal to start the day."	9.0

Perhaps they believe that Hilton guests are a captive audience, a serious miscalculation with so many good restaurants within walking distance.

Service, even with a near-empty dining room, is unbearably slow, while at the same time presenting themselves as being under enormous pressure.  Of the 6 breakfast items ordered by the four of us, one was incorrect (not even close) and a second was completely overlooked.  What was brought to our table was prepared without passion, and struggled to reach the level of ""eatable.""  

Yet, the breakfast problems paled in comparison to the dinner service.  As the only diners in the restaurant, being seated should not have taken anywhere as long as it did.  Once seated, the ""10 count"" prawn appetizer (i.e.- shrimp of approximately 2 oz. each) came to the table as shrimp of less than half that size, clumsily wrapped in eggroll wrappers and fried.  Aside from the fact that 3 different wrapping techniques were employed, this misrepresentation is clearly fraudulent.  My crab salad entrée wasn't bad, but family members who chose the duck and apple salad were considerably less positive in their assessments.

The Bluefire Grille presents itself as an eatery blessed by a good location, but with no serious intention of remaining in business.  Regrettably, and IMRHO, The Bluefire Grille thoroughly denigrates the guest experience of the Scottsdale Hilton Resort."	17.0

I asked if I could sit out there anyways, and I will go to the bar place my order, and the food runner can just bring out our food.

No servers, No Bussers, No Food Runner either, lack of complete staff. They had a new bartender who had completely screwed up making their new Mango Jalapeno Margarita I had ordered. Over doing it on the mango puree making it a smoothie and you couldn't taste anything else in it. It had to be remade. Our appetizers took 20 minutes. Our waiter was very attentive and apologetic.

The first indication that this wouldn't be the best lunch was that every single location had less than three stars...uh oh.  Well, somebody spent the $$ on the gift card, so I guess we might as well use it, right?

We were seated right away and our server was friendly.  I ordered an unsweetened raspberry iced tea and it was pretty good.  We checked out the lunch menu and the prices were decent; $6.99, $7.99, or $8.99, depending on what you ordered.  The hubs and I both ordered the Caesar salad with the new ""spicy"" fire roasted chicken salad wrap.  Big mistake.

First of all, the salad was basically like one of those prepackaged salads that has been sitting out for awhile.  The lettuce was soggy and warm.  Now here's the menu description of the wrap, ""Grilled diced chicken, creamy sriracha sauce, fire roasted vegetables, lettuce and a squeeze of fresh lime juice served in a grilled Italian Flatbread"" and there was a spicy sign next to it.  There was nothing spicy about this wrap.  In fact, there was no flavor whatsoever.  Fire roasted vegetables?  How about more wilted lettuce?

We both decided that the reason all locations had such low ratings is because they just don't care what they are serving their customers.  Based on the food, they barely deserve one star but I'll add another for the low prices and good service.  Luckily, our gift card covered both of our meals and the tip.

We planned on sitting at the bar and eating but that didn't happen cause it took 5 minutes to get me my beer and her water and it wasn't busy. Then we sat there for another 15 minutes without either bartender asking us if we were going to order food. The guy was to busy watching the soccer game and the girl was to busy talking. So we asked for a table and asked to speak to a manager and told her what happened. She said she talked to the bartenders and that the guy said he asked us if we wanted menus but he never did, he just didn't want to get in trouble. The servers and bartenders are very unprofessional and I don't think that place will be there long. Chili's will hopefully be better but I think the Texas Roadhouse down the street will still be the best place in the area. The only reason I gave two stars is because our food was good but we will not be going back there. We will go to the one on Northern or Bell.	3.0

Sometimes I wish I really could rate with negative stars, because one Star is too generous. I've been to many Applebees but this one is by far the worst experience. I ordered 10 boneless wings  (5 Buffalo and 5 spicy Asian) and got 5 cold Buffalo and I'm not sure if they tried to compensate their mess up by giving me 10 Asian... So I let it slide. My wife got a salad with meat (which the meat also happened to be cold)... Still let that slide. But then we ordered a blondie which took forever, but that wasn't much of a problem... The problem is that after waiting for the blondie for so long, the cake was cold, there was absolutely no reason to bring it out on a skillet, because even the skillet cold. What I like the most about the blondie is the warm cake with cold ice cream, it's like warm apple pie and ice cream, they go together...

The staff is very inattentive because you'll order I've tea but they won't bring you any sugar and when you finally catch them and ask for sugar they bring you a small tray full of sweet and low only. Not sugar. Next, the music. We're talking full on norteñas and duranguense music. To clarify, I am of Latin origin, my family is from Mexico more specifically so I would know what that type of music is or even what is sounds like. And I was born here In Phoenix mind you. HOWEVER.. The other 50 people in the building probably don't share my same ethnic background much less know what is being said in these songs that are blasting and blaring! I would expect this from macayos but not Applebee's. Overall very unimpressed or even comfortable with the atmosphere. So the only thing that was ok was the food. Just ok though.

Totally disgusted.Ordered the Family Fill-up Bucket and Tender Fill-up box. Had to throw most of it out. I would have returned it, but it's Christmas Eve and stopped because I was busy and no time to cook with everything going on. 6:30 pm and it appears all I got was leftovers. The bucket of chicken was heavily breaded and soaked in grease, nothing crispy about it. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was like rubber, thick skim on top of dried out, pasty potatoes. Hockey pucks for biscuits and 3 rock hard chicken nuggets passed off as chicken tenders. Seriously they were no bigger than a 50 cent piece. All 3 laid next to each other didn't even add up to what one tender should be. Not to mention they were mostly all breading. So I ended up spending $28.00 for a drink and side of coleslaw (which was good). Buyer beware, you've been warned.	0.0

Last time I went here they wasted our time and had us pull up to the window only to tell us that the cook was apparently out sick and they had no chicken and only popcorn chicken. They had nothing on the board or anywhere to signify this, nor did the person working immediately tell us while we were trying to place our order. I get really tired of coming here only for them to be consistently out of food. It's not even that I come before close. I'll come anywhere between 4-6 pm and they'll still be out of stuff! I love their food but it's just getting really old that they never seem to have enough food to meet daily demand which is ridiculous to me. Especially since I drive to this location instead of the one right by our house because the chicken is far better at this location. But what's the point if they don't even have chicken?

I called tonight to finally get an explanation on this and I'm told that on the pan pizza it's not possible!! They put less cheese on the pan crust and by asking for extra it's still not the extra that you would get on a regular crust pizza! Wtf!! Where does it say this!!?? Will no longer order from them. Not really because of the lack of extra cheese but now because of deceit.	0.0

I asked if there was any further eta on the delivery and he just said he COULD call, not that he would call.

I ordered my drink, which was supposed to be a normal size, not the world's largest margarita. Oh well, what's a few more dollars, right?
We sat without chips/salsa for quite sometime. 
Our lunch took forever and when it finally came, I wasn't impressed. It was probably the worst taco salad I've ever had. The chicken was luke warm at best. It lacked flavor.

The real reason to choose Arriba however, was their terrific Tortilla Soup.  When in the mood for homey, satisfying soup, it was the place to go! By far and away, offering the best homemade Tortilla Soup in the entire Phoenix Valley.

The Bad:  On last visit, the price on a bowl of tortilla soup hadn't changed but, the portion certainly had!! When soup arrived we were in disbelief. Barely a large cup, much less than a ""bowl"" of soup.  I asked our attentive waitress what had happened to the size of their portion?  She could only nod her head in silent understanding. While Arriba's was always a little pricey for local Mexican food, it now appears, instead of raising their prices, they chose to cut back on portion size. Duping the customer into thinking nothing has changed, does not promote loyalty. I gave two stars because the recipes are still very good, but they have lost our loyal business, skimping on a $7.00 bowl of broth!"	2.0

It's Cinco de mayo and this is a Mexican food restaurant.  I've been here before for this particular celebration and had a really good time so this review I'm writing is was really disappointing.  My friends got there ahead of me about thirty minutes and had not been approached by any wait staff to order drinks, or offered salsa and chips.  My tip meter immediately starts the calculation down.  After having to go and ask for someone to bring us chips for a table of 5 they brought us one bowl of chips, one small container of salsa and one small container of been dip.  Ok no big deal at least we go something.  Finally the waiter comes over and says oh I'm sorry, I just got into work can I get your drink order.  Had we really been waiting an hour for a waiter to be called in to serve our table?  The restaurant at this point is packed and as I look around there is a table of about 15 ladies who look really restless.  I'll get to them in a minute.  Our waiter takes our drink orders and we wait again at least another 30 minutes for drinks.  He finally comes back and only has two of the five drinks we ordered.  He asks us what were the other drinks we ordered. Seriously, you wrote this stuff down and you don't know.  Ok, we tell him and he promises to come back.  He did come back about 20 minutes later with a small margarita which looked watered down in a plastic cup, another margarita which was supposed to be large in a small glass and he had a plastic glass in which he filled with the rest of the large margarita that my friend had ordered.  I'm thinking at this point someone is punking us because the service can't really be this bad on Cinco de Mayo.  Side note the manager came to our table and said that we wouldn't have to pay for the drinks since it had taken so long.  Ok.  I agree with that because honestly the drink was not good.  Who was tending the bar???? 

We finally get our food order in and actually that didn't take too much time but I'm sorry the food really wasn't that good.  To say I was disappointed in you Arriba for your service, food and drinks was an understatement.  Let me make a couple of suggestions my friends and I came up with for an occasion as big as Cinco de Mayo.  First, make sure you have adequate wait staff to wait the crowd that you know you are expecting.  Second have more than one bartender working that day. Better yet have one that can actually make a decent margaritas. make sure you have more than just one manager on duty because with the amount of people there you are going to need more presence.  I believe there was only one manager on duty.  Oh and when you bring out food, could it be hot?  Nothing worse than waiting almost two hours with extremely bad service and getting lukewarm food.

Oh let me not forget about the table of ladies that was sitting about 5 feet from our table.  After being ignored for almost as long as our table was they all, not one or two, all of them left.  All I could do was shake my head and wonder how much money you just let walk out of the door and no one tried to make it right for them.

I will never go back to this Arriba's ever.  Here it is Cinco de Mayo and all I really wanted was a margarita and I was disappointed.  Let me suggest you take a page from Maggiano's customer service book."	4.0

We only stayed because we really had no choice. Who else was going to accommodate 15 people at 5:00 on cinco de mayo? Finally, at 5:20, I asked to speak to the manager. We still hadn't received a single drink, our chips and water had gone dry. I explained the situation, she explained to us that they were ""Very busy and what, exactly, would I like her to do?"" Well, we asked for a free round. She told us they would arrive right away and then never returned. At that point, no longer in the holiday spirit, I called the nearby pub, Skeptical Chymist, and asked if they could accommodate 15 very hungry and thirsty people.

How about the worst we have ever had??  So, now to the food.  Our waitress brought us chips, salsa and bean dip.  The chips were so stale, we could bend them in half and they wouldn't snap!  The salsa tasted like someone dumped a ton of salt in it.  The bean dip was the only thing that was eatable.  I ordered chicken enchiladas with black beans.  My husband ordered the carnitas with black beans.  After what seemed like forever, we were brought two plates of food, and you guessed it...with refried beans practically spilling off the plate.  The waitress offered to take the food back and or get black beans, but we just kept the plates.  No room on these tables for any more plates (and no leg room under the tables either!).  My husband's carnitas had large slices of red cabbage and red onion in it.  What?  Cabbage in carnitas?  Needless to say, it was bland and simply awful.  The only way he could eat it was with some of the over salted salsa.  My enchiladas were the worst I have ever had!  Bland, no flavor.  I had to add some of the bean dip just to eat about half of one of them.  Then we asked for a to go container for the rest of my food and the bill.  Fifteen minutes later the waitress came back.  By this time, my food started to look like something found on the side of the road.  I left it there and thought I should call the hazmat department for disposal.

The food is okay, and the Margaritas are surprisingly inconsistent - sometimes great, sometimes tasting of strong sours mix.

I really wish hygiene were more of a priority. On my last visit, we were greeted by a courteous young lady who sat us down at a booth. That booth, however, had sticky seats and table. And it wasn't the type of stickiness that comes from forgetting to clean a table... nay, it was that stickiness of a table, seat and menus diligently wiped down with a dubious rag, thus homogenizing the film of subtle but persistent stick factor over all these things. Perhaps I was being too squeamish. I wanted to like this place, to reassure myself that it was still okay to eat here: I put the menu down and picked up the plates in the table setting to inspect them... and there was stickiness on those too, along with dried food stuck on one of them. At that point, my wife and I decided to not eat here, and started heading out. The hostess asked us why we wouldn't stay and I discreetly told her and showed her. She agreed that it was terrible and sought to make things better, even offered to give us a soft drink on the house to go, but we declined and thanked her.

Since I am the king of not letting go, I will probably give Arriba's another try in the future. I urge you to give them another chance as well, although it's hard to justify with so many interesting places to eat in the area.

And sadly, I must say that the same pervasive stickiness was found in all my visits, but I kept overlooking it, and I kept coming back to meet up with friends. Well, now I suggest an alternate spot.

Stopped by for their reverse happy hour.

Salsa was good. Kind of spicy for mild which I liked.

Disappointed that the bean dip AND the queso had chorizo. 

We split the Mexican pizza subbing the meat for beans. Greasy but satisfying. It's good if you put tons of salsa on it. About halfway through eating it however, I detected something meaty in their beans. Now, I am not a super strict vegetarian. I will eat refried beans at most Mexican places as long as there is not an overwhelming lard or meaty taste. (On a side note though- I feel it is completely unnecessary to use lard or meat products in beans. My favorite Mexican food place- Mi Pueblo- makes excellent beans with no lard. When beans are a vegetarian staple, why would a restaurant be inconsiderate and make it non-vegetarian? Okay- end rant.) So back to Arriba's beans... It tasted something a bit porkish. It kind of killed my appetite so I was done after two pieces.

My husband also ordered pork taquitos which he was underwhelmed by. Although a big chorizo fan, he said the queso it came with wasn't great.

Our server was good. Charming and accommodating.

But what really turned me off was the bill. My husband didn't tell me until we were in the car, so I didn't have a chance to fight it. $31 total. Hmmmm... happy hour prices on the Mexican pizza should have been $8 and $3. On top of that a draft Bud Light (also on special) and a Corona. $31 does NOT make sense. Our server didn't seem so charming and accommodating anymore.

We asked for the check and after waiting a good amount of time the server came up to ask us at least twice what each of us had to eat then disappeared confused. He even went to the table next to us who had already paid and picked up their checks to look through it seeing if he gave them ours.

Not sure that the on line ordering is working well, or maybe some more time or experience will help. Had to wait about 20 minutes for a pizza to be cooked because the order did not go through properly. Staff was apologetic. Food was decent and reasonably priced using the on line coupons.
     I would go there again, but I would not be surprised if I had to wait. The on line ordering is really being pushed by the corporate, but I did not think the ordering process went very well' it's not user friendly. Perhaps some web magic can fix this problem, but in the mean time I will probably call it in and hope for the best."	0.0

Used iPhone app for a repeat order which included a room number at a local college where this store delivers daily. Bottom line, the delivery guy never delivered because he ""did not"" have the room number, (which he did,) and HE NEVER ENTERED THE BUILDING(!!!) Manager was even worse blaming it on me for not answering my phone. I took it up with corporate, Robin Mc Intrye who fobbed me off with an e-mail ... ""contact manager."" I responded that I had and it was no help. One month later I again complained to corporate and Robin Mc Intyre called me and basically read from a corporate script. Could not, would not explain to me how a pizza delivery guy would not ""ring the doorbell"" saying that it was for security reasons(?) Really? At a well lit college campus with security running around late night on golf carts, security at the front door, with students all around and I can see the Dominos sign from classrooms? When I pressed for a basic explanation and told him his offer of free pizza was not buying me and reminded him that the college, corporately, orders from this store frequently, he told me I was ""being hostile."" Just FYI corporate ""customer service"" folk. Never tell an unhappy customer they are hostile and then threaten them with a suggestion that you would close their account. Well, at least he didn't give me the ""F-U"" that the Michigan Dominos manager did as seen in the news this month. Advice: Stand up for the consumer and boycott Dominos.

I asked for a pepperoni pizza with heavy sauce and when I got home from picking it up the pizza had little to no sauce on it at all, less than you would find on a normal pizza. So I gave them a call thinking they just mixed it up and we could replace it, apparently not. They were very rude and said they used a ton of sauce and they can't do anything. I'm upset because I wasted my money and couldn't even get it fixed, at no point in time was I rude to them either, they just have zero sense of customer service. I wouldn't recommend coming to this location because if something gets messed up, they basically tell you to just deal with it.	0.0

Our last TWO orders have BOTH been wrong and when we called to complain the service has not been stellar.  First they forgot the pizza toppings we ordered and paid for and told us we'd get a free pizza next time but hung up without telling us how to redeem it - we had to call back to find out!  Then we called because they forgot the sauces (that they charge for) to go with our cheesy bread and got nothing but attitude. Small mistakes but not handled poorly.

Now there are times when they got my order right, but the times that they got my order wrong was more then enough for me to just pay a little more for delivery from papa john's.

Multiple times they got my order for a pasta bread bowl wrong. I order chicken Alfredo bread bowls from them a lot because when I was enlisted they always made that just as I had asked. But for some reason this dominos doesn't seem to know how to make them. Multiple times they undercooked it, I sometimes got a big bread bowl and other times I got a bread bowl that was tiny. Just recently I ordered a bread bowl with extra chicken, what I got was a 1 chicken, and a lot of alfredo. I am by no means a vegan, so why do I get 1 piece of chicken when I ordered extra chicken?

Their pizza is also greasy like a mofo. When you order wings that are not spicy, you get mild wings ( for some, people don't care but you ordered it a specific way).

Overall, if you want pizza, order elsewhere. They give you what they want to give you, not what you ordered."	0.0

We sat outside in the lovely and peaceful courtyard by the fountain. The waitress was very earnest and sweet. I ordered a Tuna MELT with sweet potato fries. Everything on the plate was cold, though the plate was warm. There was a sprinkle of cheese on the top that looked like it was broiled for 20 seconds to brown, but even that was cold. I asked the waitress to have them re-heat the sandwich, and maybe put a little more cheese on the top. She returned with the cold sandwich and cold fries. She told me that the chef said 'that's how the sandwich is supposed to be'. She even came out with another waitress that affirmed that the tuna melt is supposed to be cold: ""it's a tuna salad and comes cold"". I pointed out that my fries were cold. The waitress reached over and grabbed one from my plate and said ""yeah, it is cold! I'm sorry."" She came back later and said that the manager was running to a meeting but would take 10% off for me 'for the inconvenience.' I would have rather had some warm food! I tried to be a good sport and eat it, but it was unappetizing so I left it uneaten.

We took her recommendation and waited about 5 minutes. We were then informed they didn't have any so we went with the guacamole and salsa. The salsa was tangy and smelled like it was made with bad tomatoes. We moved to the restaurant and ordered the ribeye medium rare. It came out so over cooked it was hard to eat. The macaroni was literally Kraft Mac. The Ahi tuna was horrible. To make up for it we were served rock hard bread that could be used as a blunt object to knock someone out.

The waitress was less than helpful and seemed a little annoyed to even be there.

My wife ordered the pulpo mojo de ajo which had decent flavor but was swimming in oil and was too salty.

One complaint I will share is that we asked to replace fries with onion rings on one of the burger plates.  We were told that it would cost .99 cents extra, which was fine (usually there is a cost to ""upgrade"" to onion rings).  So was very surprised with the burger came with four (4)...yes, four small onion rings.  Stick with fries next time!  

The huge eclair caught our eye when we went by the bakery case and we were excited to splurge with one.  Skip it, folks.  It was very dry and the filling was skimpy (actually it was thicker in the dead center of this huge eclair but overall, the experience was not worth the cost.

Got the fish ""special"" for $15.50 and got 3 tiny pieces of soggy beer battered fish that tasted spoiled, along with soggy burnt oil tasting French fries, and it came with hush puppies, supposed to be plural, but the cook made one big flattened lemon size one instead and dipped it in the same burnt oil for probably 5 seconds, it too was soggy and no where near cooked inside, a shame if you know real hush puppies. To top it off, it came with a side of again, soggy and no crunch cole slaw that was so bad I spit it out on top of my nasty fries. This all came with a blonde, obviously drinking on the job waitress/bartender, who was completely unprofessional and even slightly louder and more annoying than the drunk customers that she was enjoying the company of. Don't waist you money in this joint, you don't even want to know what the bar area smells like, horrible and unkempt.

The young Mexican chick behind the counter did not acknowledge us. I had to ask if she could wipe the counter down. She stood around talking to the other Mexican customers. It took for another waitress to walk up and assist us, but not before her asking the young girl did she take care of us. Our waitress was nice she only got lost for a little while when we told her we needed a few minutes to look over the menu. The food was great as it always is, but she forgot my syrup when she brought out my pancakes and that only took her a few minutes to bring back as well. Once we were done and went to pay the manager was in a full conversation with another customer and once he finished he hello took the receipt and payment, but never once asked how was everything!!! Bad customer service goes a long way and I have no patience to eat at an establishment that makes me fill like I'm not wanted or where the workers don't want to work...

I'm not sure if they were short-staffed, but we had the following very disappointing issues, and management did not seem particularly concerned when I reported them:

1) Our private party room's tables were all dirty.  Hair, lettuce, frosting, pizza sauce, etc.  Literally on every table.
2) Our ""party host"" took so long to give us our package's tokens that our guests began buying them themselves.
3) When we did get the tokens (super tokens worth 20 tokens that work in the machines), the party host told us we could use them in the token changer's 25 cent slot.  They did not, and our guests spent several frustrating minutes figuring out that they only worked in the other machine.
4) The party host didn't take our pizza order until nearly 45 minutes after we arrived.
5) The bathroom's toilets were clogged with toilet paper (in one) and tampons (in another).  The other toilet had no toilet paper.
6) Our package included fountain drinks.  The guests wanted lemonade.  Guess which fountain drink was out?
7) We ordered 15 waters for the adults.  They only had 10.  4 were cold; the remaining six were warm (not even room temperature).
8)  The package included a separate mini-pizza for the birthday child.  The party host brought the pizza a half hour after the rest of the kids' food--long after my kid was done eating.
9) There was a mistake on the bill--not in my favor, obviously (but it was quickly corrected).
10) The package included a t-shirt for the birthday child.  It was not given to us until I asked.
11) This is probably a very finicky complaint, but the lighting in the party room was so dim.  All of the pictures looked like the party was in a dank basement.
12)  There were two other parties (at least) going on at the same time, and the crowdedness and volume were both intense.

He apologized, asked if I wanted him to send another sandwich out, it was already around 8pm so I told him no I was just going to eat it and he said he would put a note in my order so the next time I ordered I wouldn't have to pay for the spread which was fine, I just didn't want to pay for something I didn't get. I called in today to order another sandwich and explained to the girl Lizz who took my order the situation and she assured me it would be no problem she would tell her manager and they would take care of it. Well,  I hour my sandwich with no spread so I called back and spoke to the manager Kelsey who told me there were no notes in my order and obviously Devlin did not do his job and there was nothing she could do to right their mistake.

  Our pizza came out and it tasted like water from the fountain with out lemon, it had this really weird taste. maybe it was the sauce mixed with sink water. the cheese was good so we ate the top of the pizza.
   Games broke. picture taking one was out of paper! the car picture didn't work but took tokens. the car game by the front shut off while playing. just really bad service.
  the hand stamp is why I loved going here, great security feature and the 25 cent per game is really fun and ideal.

They took away the little kids slide so toddlers have nothing to play on since they can't go up the big slide. A quarter of the games are broken and eat your tokens.  Most don't give tickets. If you mention this to the staff they just say ok but don't put up a sign and continue on their way. If the staff was more engaged, the games were maintained and their was a toddlers slide/play area my rating would be much higher. The kids generally have a good time because they are easy going and ignore all the nonsense adults get irritated about.

1. Food 
     It's sub-par. (Then again, it's Chuck-E-Cheese's.)
  - Salad Bar was not kept up or maintained. I noticed how toppings were falling into other toppings, looked like a mess. Wife received food poisoning from the Salad Bar. It's also not all you can eat Salad bar, (maybe that was for the best)

2. Games
    - Your typical arcade, ticket - winning games. Although, less than half of them are working when you go there, while the rest either eat your tokens or are out of order. 

3. Chuck-E-Cheese Mascot
  - When you go to take your kids here, you want them to get the full experience don't you? Well don't hold your breath or you will turn red & blue in the face.

   Unless you are willing to wait until almost closing time for Chuck-E-Cheese to make one SINGLE appearance and settle for the robotic version/on the screen tv's (Sorry, but its NOT the same thing) 

If they DO have the Chuck-Cheese Mascot walk out... Expect for a Chuck-E-Cheese Employee to dress up in the costume and walk around aimlessly, while distracting the kids with ""free-tickets""...MAYBE. when I say ""free tickets"" I have it in quotations for a reason, and use those words loosely. Because your kid may not get anything at all when you have other kids scrambling for a mere few tickets. So Chuck-E will come out for 5 minute walk with some high-fives..Donald Trump would call it Low-Energy, so would I.

Almost immediately after opening a single homeless man came in wearing gloves and sat next to the emergency exit watching the kids. The front entrance has the hand stamper to discourage child abductors but the emergency exit must be unlocked & accessible in the event of an emergency. It made me really nervous. I alerted management who said the ""homeless"" guy frequents the place regularly but they won't deny him service because he pays. As our time wore on the man became more agitated walking around the games talking to himself pretending to put in and remove imaginary glasses and sitting down to play a driving game every time a child sat in the adjoining seat. It was pretty clear that he is mentally disturbed and made me extremely anxious. While I'm compassionate toward his circumstances I can't ignore the fact that I had very real concern of his intentions &  am worried about Chuck E Cheese's nonchalant attitude toward the matter.

My take... food is pretty bad, wings are well, let me put it this way, imagine you microwave a handful of Dyno-bites chicken nuggets, toss it in some sauce and try to pass that as boneless wings...yeah, that bad.
Everytime we go, I swear it's the last time.  The machines work about half the time, whether they are out of tickets, swallow tokens, etc.  Trying to find an employee to fix it, is next to impossible, by the time they show up, kids have forgotten about it so their tickets are lost and so is the token.  
The hand stamping at the entrance is a double edge sword. On one side, kids can't leave, but on the other... parents DO!  This last time we went, there were these kids basically stealing tickets, tokens, etc from other kids, climbing on the equipment (cheating), they were told I don't know how many times to stop.  Myself and another parent got fed up with these little punks, frustrated unable to find these kids parents... We complained about it, we were told... ""oh yeah, those kids have been here for a while, they won't stop or listen, I think they were dropped off"", so, why don't you call the cops??? You can't just drop off your kids and leave!  

I wouldn't say it's ""dirty"" in the sense of being neglected.  That is one thing I do see, is somewhere always walking around wiping things down, but still doesn't fix the fact some people are just gross, walking around with food and greasy hands, leaving it everywhere sometimes it falls in the games... kids walking around with food in their mouths (taking big bites and realize it's too big of a bite while playing a game and spitting out), again, comes down to lack of oversight by parents...  

Employees are polite and patient (you have to be to work here), I would say is bad customers who ruin the experience... One group of them is enough to ruin many other family's experience.  Maybe asking people causing trouble to leave??? I mean they do it in bars and restaurants, why not a kids play place??? Just a thought."	1.0

When he finally delivered our check, I asked if he was going to say anything or do anything about the bug in my soup. He just looked at me, still not saying anything, took the check back and comped my meal. After 10 minutes of him blatantly walking past our table a dozen times to help other diners, we had to walk up and insist he finalize our bill, STILL NOT SAYING ONE SINGLE WORD to us. Between the questionable food preparation practices and the absolute lack of customer service, I cannot believe this place is still open. DO NOT GO HERE!"	2.0

Nothing has changed. Rude lady took my order, seriously sounded like the ""....and then ....person"" and  she wanted .75 cents to upgrade to brown/fried rice on the kids meal.  No biggie, no problem. However the guy behind me orders white rice and he gets told they have no more white rice but they will give him fried... ok whatever.  She never left the register and we were standing next to each other. Did she telepathically know the rice was gone? Weird.
I get my food and the Mongolian beef was all onions, maybe 5 small pieces of meat.
The orange chicken was sweet and sour at best and the hot and sour soup was some lukewarm broth with some vegetables... ew!  Sorry but I can't come back.   Just upsetting to spend 47 dollars and not eat."	2.0

Most of the food seemed disgusting, with a waiter basically bringing out a noodle soup that consisted of a bowl of warm water, and a block of dry, packaged noodles. The waiter then just placed the block of dry noodles in, and left, without stirring or anything. The chicken was decent though, and I think it was the Kung-Pao chicken that was the best.

The service was adequate, but truthfully, hard to judge, since they did what was necessary to get out food, pay the bills, etc. but never had a conversation with us. I wouldn't say they were rude, or distant, but they weren't that friendly with the customers.

I have never written a review before but I am abolutely compelled to write this one.  After about six or seven people warned me that Panera Bread is not the caliber of Paradise Bakery, I decided to try it myself.  Well, they were right. First off, one person is at the register and there are many people in line. I guess not everyone want to order off a kiosk. I ordered two chicken walnut sandwiches to go (thinking it would be like Paradise Bakery)  NOT SO AT ALL.  First off, when you order a full sandwich you really don't want a side of  dinner roll or baguette.  That is what they offered me.  I declined - I asked if I could order one chocolate chip cookie and one oatmeal cookie. They added it to the bill (no more cookies added to the order free of charge).  She then came back and said ""we are out of chocolate chip cookies"" - How does a restaurant run out of cookies?  I took another oatmeal cookie.  I waited approx 15 minutes to get my sandwiches. I finally was able to leave and take them home. There is no way this sandwich comes close to the chicken walnut sandwich from Paradise Bakery.  I actually is about 1/2 to 3/4 in size, bland in taste both the chicken salad and the bread.  I feel very badly that this company took over Paradise Bakery and the service and the quality had gone down so dramatically.  I guess you should listen to your friends.

Had my heart set on asiago and everything bagels to share with company the following morning. I tried out their rapid pick-up order on my way home, normally I pick bagels from Chompy's but this sounded better.

I was called to be advised neither of my bagel flavors were available. Almost all the available bagels were sweet, which I'm not a huge fan of. I asked if they had any bagels that were not sweet and advised only the sprouted grain was available. I hesitantly asked for the 6 sprouted grains, and ended up getting only 5. The rest of my bagels were made up of french toast, cinnamon raisin, and cinnamon crunch. I also had to change one of my cream cheese tubs over the phone to honey walnut to match the bagels, which would have been great if they didn't give ones that expired in four days. Also they don't give you tubs, they give you four individual packets instead which was a bit of a surprise.

The bagels were not great, most were pretty hard and stale, I would be surprised if they weren't baked a day go. The sprouted grain bagel ended up being half the size (apparently a flat bagel, this was never communicated to me by the employee) of the other bagels and hard. Not exactly the type of bagel you want for straight cream cheese for a bagel breakfast. 

I can say the best part of the experience was that the order was ready quickly without a line up. I will never order bagels this way again though, and will just go to Chompy's. They always have tons of bagels in stock no matter what time you go and they taste a lot more fresh!

Paradise had a great grilled cheese sandwich. Good quality, healthy bread and multiple cheeses. Panera has an aggressively disgusting version with a huge glop of American cheese (barely melted all the way) between two pieces of limp, non-crispy/soggy WHITE bread. It is horrendous and offensive on every level imaginable. My two year old nephew could slap together a more appetizing sandwich!

Today I tried the tomato mozzarella flatbread and it was pretty much ALL tomato & greens with literally NO mozzarella! Ugh! Terrible. The vegetarian tomato soup that came with it? Also terrible- flavorless and more of a thick pudding-like consistency than soup!

Luckily the cookies seem to taste the same, but they don't have all the options they used to. I haven't seen a delicious molasses cookie or a fab lemon zester cookie since Paradise Bakery cleared out of this place. What a shame. Definite downgrade. End of an era.

I retract my statement regarding food being essentially the same. Paradise had an outstanding club sandwich on a croissant roll that Panera has not continued. Also, the cookies are not as good.

I think Panera should migrate the other way to Paradise but Panera is the bigger gorilla so this is the way it is. I have been to this Paradise location hundreds of times. The first time I went into the new Panera I was greeted by ""The Wall"". I thought they had changed the entrances and I had come in a back door. Nope. Welcome to The Wall and the iPads that they apparently want you to order on. I went looking for real people and gave my order to them. The new design does not flow well and feels closed in compared to the old design. There is a bottleneck where the food pick-up point is close to the drink machines. The Wall really closes in the space and makes it feel fast food-ish. I did not get that feeling before. I come to Paradise for the chicken walnut sandwiches and cookies. They still have the chicken walnut but now you get chips instead of a cookie. What?? No cookie?? Push the eject button. I'm outa here. Now this feels like just another sandwich shop to me. You may feel differently but my experience is not the same.

This Panera is the worse, from the horrendous service to the subpar food.  In general ordering takes forever and they try to push you to use the iPads.  I'm comfortable using technology but their system makes it challenging when you are trying to make modifications.  The iPads will also charge you for some add ons or substitutions that you wouldn't be charged for at the register.  I could be wrong (or maybe it has changed) but there is no way to put in your rewards number or redeem rewards on the iPads.  

We go in on Sunday and it's slow.  They are busiest M-F with local businesses in the area.  My order is quick today but never efficient.  I will admit my order was a PITA...I wanted tuna and cheese on white - that's it.  Not TU-day!  My sandwich came on wheat with lettuce, tomato and onion.  I also got a watermelon feta salad.  I requested no arugula/sub fields greens and it came full of arugula.  Now - I only ordered the salad this way because last time I ordered it they were out of arugula and asked if they could sub the field greens and I actually really liked it this way.  

I can honestly say I can't remember a time I went to this location and our entire order was correct.  They advertise that if you experience an issue they will correct it and offer a complimentary pastry.  Well that never happens.  I never ask either because I just want my order to be correct.  I'm not looking for something free.  

We only continue going to this location because it's close to home and it's one of my daughter's favorite places.  I have been repeatedly annoyed by simply ordering a grilled cheese for my daughter.  I literally tell them to charge me twice $$ for extra cheese because they only put one slice on their kids grilled cheese sandwich.  Really?  That doesn't even count as a sandwich.  Although I think their pricing is fair (in general) they can splurge for 2 slices of cheese!  

My biggest pet peeve at this place is the design.  They have the tiniest drink station and it's right next to the expediting line.  So all the food is coming out and people are trying to collect their food and get drinks all in one small contested area.  They hide the napkins and drink lids under the counter of the drink station.  Every single time I am there someone is asking the expediter for the lids.  My toddler could have come up with a better design.  It was clearly an afterthought.  

Customer service is dreadful.  I have had rude experiences with two of the female managers that expedite the kitchen when simply asking them to correct their mistakes.  There is a very nice young man named Chris that has worked there since the transition from Paradise (I believe).  He is always hustling and asking people if he can help or how things are.  The people at the register are pretty friendly as well.  This place needs new management!  It's a far cry from what Paradise used to be."	0.0

We had used it a few times in the past and never had any problem.  In fact, for previous meetings, the staff couldn't have been nicer, friendlier or more professional.

Although we called to confirm the room in the afternoon and were told that everything was on track, when we arrived, the so-called manager, Judy, had no idea we were coming and told us that, unless she was told about it by the catering department, there was nothing she could do.  No empathy, no customer service - just ""sorry, you're out of luck.""

So, we went into the room and attempted to setup for our meeting.  That is when Judy and another manager, who was equally as untrained in working with the public, came in and explained that we were not entitled to the private room.  In fact, they chastised us (THE CUSTOMERS) for trying to use the room.  They claim that the private room is no longer a private room and ""corporate"" has told them they are no longer allowed to reserve it.  We were being lectured for trying to give them our money.  We found that very difficult to believe as we were confirmed in the room THAT AFTERNOON.

If the restaurant was packed and they had more business than they knew what to do with, I can see some justification for this pathetic level of customer service.  However, it wasn't.  The place was quite empty.  It seems to me that, on the traditionally slowest night of the week in the restaurant industry (Monday), a savvy restaurant would try to get as many customers as they could.  We are not a huge group, but we usually have around 20 people that ALWAYS order dinner.    

Before posting here, I wrote to their customer service department and my email was ignored.  I have been in the restaurant industry for over 20 years and have never seen such poor customer service.

Fortunately, they have a dining room in addition to a drive through, so I didn't have to make a forced decision to keep the drive through line moving.  I went for the dining room.  One thing that encouraged me to try this place was the big sign on the outside that says ""Licuados"" which is something I don't see on too many menus and which I absolutely love (it's kind of like a milk shake but I think the primary ingredients are milk and ice, not ice cream).

I ordered a milanesa torta (a sandwich with breaded skirt steak), a chicken gordita (sort of like a grilled sandwich bun stuffed kind of like a pita pocket with meat and other fillings), and, of course, a licuado....banana flavored, my favorite.  Size large of course lol.  The torta normally comes with chips and I ordered fries instead.  According to the menu, there was a $1.00 upcharge for the fries, and I was fine with that....until I glanced at my receipt and saw that I'd been charged $1.50.

The total price for my two sandwiches, fries, and licuado was something like $22.50.  I thought that was a bit high.  I can go to McDonald's and get a couple of plus-sized deluxe burgers, large fries, and a drink for about $16 bucks.

How was the food?  Well, the torta was somewhere between okay and not great.  The guacamole they put on it (comes with) had that chalky taste that guacamole gets...I'm not sure how, but it gets.  Not that it's spoiled, it just tastes chalky.  Not pleasant.  And the meat was inconsistent.....tender and delicious in some spots, rubber-band-gristly that I literally had to tear apart with my teeth in others.  The gordita was delicious; I have no complaints about that.  The fries were the skinny McDonald's kind, which I love, but about half of them were a little hard.  The licuado was heaven....and for $4.50, it should have been.  Probably a good thing, though, or I'd be buying them 2 or 3 times a day and be lactating in no time.

Will I go back?  Yeah.  They have a pretty extensive menu.  I want to try the chimichanga and the shrimp fajitas.  And more licuados.  I just probably won't go very often.

The pros:  The licuados, the gordita

We understand that it was pretty late, but we were assured that it would be okay. So we placed our order, and 40 minutes later our pizza arrived. We stood outside and we noticed a car that kept driving up and down the street, going pretty fast, then realized it was the delivery driver. So we walked up to help him locate our home. The driver pulled up, rolled down his window, and handed us the pizza and liter of soda through his window. Then he said, and I quote, ""I won't bother you to sign your receipt, but if you were to tip me, how much do you want to give me?"" I wanted to not tip him all together, but my fiancee decided to tip him $6, which he clearly did not deserve.I understand it was late and we were probably the last delivery of the night, but come on. That was just lazy and so incredibly unprofessional. The pizza itself was delicious, hence the two starts, but I would rather order from a different location to assure I don't have to deal with that particular driver again."	0.0

My husband and I made a reservation for 8pm on 12/23. Our party of two got seated within 10 minutes and our server was prompt to take our drink order. We ordered onion rings for an appetizer, and it took 20 min. And came out cold.

At that point our server disappeared for about 30 min. We still had no entrees. When the server stopped by after another 15 min. (That's a total of 45 min. after getting our appetizer) he said that he confirmed our order was back there but there was another large party ahead of us. He had no estimate on when we would be getting our food.

Well, after another 10 min., we overhead that the big group next to us had been sitting there for over 2 hrs and still didn't have their entrees. They got up and left without paying. 

At that point we flagged down our server and told him to cancel our order and get us our check for the drinks and appetizer. We had a $5 off coupon which he said he would have to have the manager bring by in cash because their computer system could not handle it. The manager came by and gave us $5 cash. Then when the server brought back our receipt, he showed us that he was able to take the $5 off the check so he needed the $5 cash back!

We were at our table for a total of 1 1/2 hours. We have never had such a poor experience at a restaurant that we left without ever getting our entrees.

The hostess started walking us into the saloon and I asked if we could sit in the restaurant because they had live music that night. She told us that only people with reservations can sit in the dining room. She sat us in the saloon and we waited for over 10 minutes for a server to even acknowledge us. Servers walked by our table several times, but no one even asked if we had been taken care of. 

Finally, a woman in jeans and a tank top came and took our order. When we ordered my daughter's kids meal, I asked for milk with it. I was informed that milk has to be purchased separately and that only soft drinks come with the kids meal. I told her that was ridiculous and opted to purchase milk rather than give my one year-old soda. 

Then the server walked away without asking for my husband's and my beverage orders. Our appetizer and my daughter's meal came out at the same time. I then had to flag the server down to get silverware and napkins. We were not offered side plates. Then our meals came out about three minutes later! We ended up eating our appetizer as a side dish. My husband also received the wrong steak and rather than automatically fixing the situation, the food runner asked if that was fine with him anyway. He said it was fine for the sake of convenience. When the food runner gave me my plate, she put it down in front of my daughter and shoved it across the table to me, pulling half of the table cloth along with the plate. Then she said ""ow ow ow"" as if the plate was hot. It most definitely was not hot. 

All of our condiments and side dishes came in plastic take-out ramekins - with lids on them as if we were going to take them home instead of eating there. The food itself was decent - my husband ended up with the New York strip (not what he ordered) and I had the prime rib. The kids Mac and cheese, however, was greasy, globby and it came with a fair amount of pepper on top. She barely ate any of it so I asked our server for a to-go box. She came back with a styrofoam cup and shoved it into the cup, writing ""Mac n cheese"" in purple pen on the side. 

She did offer us a free dessert for the mistake with the steak order. However, she just brought out an apple crisp in a disposable tin baking pan- we didn't get to choose or to indicate a food allergy if that had been the case. 

I also never saw a full dining room or even heard live music anyway. I'll also add that the bathroom was less than clean. Made me cringe to have my toddler in there with me. This place has absolutely zero ambience. Servers from the forbidden dining room had western wear on, but they were hanging out in the saloon to watch the sports scores on the TVs. Kind of killed the mood.

Another 45 minutes later I asked our server where was our dinners? She told us they would be out in 5 minutes. After waiting 15 minutes longer, we asked for our check which was comped by the manager.

However this started when we even tried to make a reservation. Over the phone it seemed as though the restaurant would be packed all night long because we were told ""you can't add anymore guests to your reservation or else we won't be able to accommodate them."" Fine, fair enough we figured they were very busy.

We were shocked upon walking in and counting DOZENS of empty tables. We had a reservation for 8 PM, and arrived promptly at 8. We were told we had to wait to set up the table (isn't that a point of a reservation?) we ended up waiting almost 20 minutes just to be sat at the same table we stared at from the waiting area that was already set up. 

Then comes the service (or lack there of) 10 minutes to take drink orders, 10 minutes to take appetizer orders, about 40 minutes to even take our dinner order, another 40 minutes just for dinner to come out.... etc etc my prime rib wasn't medium like I ordered it was actually more rare than medium rare. However terrified I would have to wait another hour to get a properly cooked piece of meat I said nothing. Meals are ridiculously overpriced for what you get in both quality and portion.

We had to ask for a to go box 3 times, finally someone else brought one out. Checks were a hot mess, and then the mandatory gratuity added on was icing on the cake. Our waitress made bank in tips off our table for really not doing a damn thing when the restaurant wasn't even half full.

The smoked chicken was bone dry, the pulled pork was rubbery, ribs were burnt and our kids hamburgers were hockey pucks. The kids mac and cheese was one huge glob of grease and noodles!

The restaurant did not open until 5 so everyone had to wait in a line until the hostess turned a sign around stating they were open. Once seated we ordered our dinners. Then a magician came right over. This was great as it kept my 5 and 2 year olds busy until dinner arrived. He finished up as dinner arrived and then stood there awkwardly waiting for a tip. We don't carry much cash on us so we put together a couple bucks and when he saw it was ones said ""nevermind, just keep it"". 
When we ordered dinner my husband ordered a beer, he never received it. Our kids ordered cheeseburgers. When they started to eat them both girls took the meat out and just ate the buns. When we tried the meat it tasted lime freezer burned hamburger. No wonder they would not eat it. They tasted awful. 
We finished dinner and asked about ice cream. We were told they had cinnamon but there were other flavors in the general store. They never mentioned my mothers birthday even thought we told them when we made the reservation and they asked again when we were seated.

Baked potato was cold as were the mashed potatoes on our other order.  They gave one small piece of chicken.  When we order the chicken before, they gave 2 large, thick pieces.  When asked what happened, we were told, it was the chiefs decision to cut down the portion to be more profitable.  Poor, poor decision as they just lost two good customers.  I also would not recommend the steakhouse to any one nor will I bring my out-of-town guest there.  We did speak to the manager and he told us the same thing.  Bad decisions by the chief, because if they keep cutting the portions down, they won't have to worry about being profitable, there will no customers and they will be out of business.

I finally went online and made the stupid reservation, not that you need one anyway. Anyway, food was pretty gross. Salad bar looked like the selections were at least one week old.

The waitresses and hostess' were rude and couldn't care less weather we ate or not, it seemed as if this was normal! We finally got a manager to let us order take out from the bar but they didn't want to give us silverware to eat with WTF? portion sizes were very small and not worth the price at all maybe if we got to experience the ambiance and the actual restaurant then it could have been worth it but over all the whole experience sucked. Plus we had to pay $10 to park and there was not forewarning for that either."	3.0

I ordered the filet mignon & let me tell ya'll- no amount of A1 was going to help make it taste better. My husband ordered the beef ribs- honey, all I saw was a lot of ribs & no meat on them!  So, what management can do is thank Cali & give her a raise because she is the only reason why I did not give this here eatery 1 star.	1.0

My Grandchildren came away thrilled.  The room they seated us in did not seem to be that busy but they had a great crowd.  The band playing was great.  Sadly the service and the food left something to be desired.  The children's meals seemed to be eaten but the meals for the five adults left something to be desired.  My Filet was cold and very dry, the baked potato was small and also cold.   Maybe just an off night?  Don't see us going back for the lack of service and the quality of the food.  I certainly did not get my money's worth $250.00 bill.	2.0

We arrived at Rawhide around 3 p.m. and did a tour of the town. The place was more ghost town then western town. We saw at most two dozen other patrons walking about, and the parking lot in front of Rawhide was nearly empty, at less than 1% capacity filled. By 4:30 p.m. we were hungry and decided to go to the Steakhouse and see about getting seated early. We walked in and saw that the dining room was about 5% full, and the bar was completely empty with no one in there and several more large round tables available. Great! Shouldn't be a problem. We informed the hostess we had reservations for 5:30 p.m. but hoped we might be seated an hour early, seeing as the place was practically empty. We were told by the hostess that they would not seat us early, we would have to wait until 5:30 p.m. We pointed out the fact that the dining room was nearly empty and there was no one at any of the tables in the bar. This didn't matter to her one bit, she was adamant, with all the  empathy and compassion of a robot, they were unable to seat us for another hour. We stepped away in disgust, used the restrooms and then went into the bar to discuss our options. After about 15 minutes we informed the hostess we would not wait until 5:30, cancelled our reservation and left. We saw no evidence of any new customers entering Rawhide and we left Rawhide the ghost town that it is. I can only wonder how this place manages to stay in business treating their customers this way. We will never come back.	1.0

We arrived 10 minutes before 6p.m. that night. Even with lots of tables available, they made us wait until exactly 6p.m. before sitting us. Not a big deal. Then, we seat for another 10 minutes before anyone noticed us. Since they were so busy that night, our waiter wanted us to order our food right then and there. Not a problem. We understand. Needless to say, our main entrée did not arrive until an hour later. Yes, you heard me right. It was exactly an hour. What made me furious was this - I order a prime rib medium rare and it came in almost completely cooked. 

It clearly wasn't our water's fault that the kitchen wasn't doing their jobs. Even the manager came over to apologize and gave us a free appetizer. I notified the waiter that my steak was not to my liking, but I was too hungry to wait for another one. The only reason I didn't give it a 1 star is because the manager felt bad and comp us on my meal. The music was so loud we couldn't even talk to each other without screaming. Overall, it was a horrible experience. 

I will never come back here again. It literally ruined my Friday night."	9.0

We were celebrating my son's birthday and we decided to go to Rawhide since my great granddaughters (aged 1 and 3) were going also. We thought they would have fun at the attractions there with the petting zoo etc.  We were there at 5:30 and not many people there. We went to see what was in the petting zoo. All we could see was a Turkey, a chicken and a bird. It cost $5 for an adult and kids three and under free. We decided it wasn't worth it so we walked back towards the restaurant hoping there would be something for the kids to see on the way. Nothing was open. We finally decided we were just going to have dinner. The dining room was near empty. They told us the wait was two hours!!! There was hardly anyone there and maybe two couples behind us. They said the had people with reservations but the place was empty. Will never go back to Rawhide. It was a waste of time. We ended up going to Outback and had a great meal and a great time.	0.0

Menu stated, rattle snake,  Boa Constrictor, and Python,  all mixed together in metal bowl, with chips and sauce surrounding it.  Snake meat was no larger than a dime, and it was breaded, for 22 dollars it was a huge disappointment.  Ordered New York Strip Steak, 3 cheese macaroni, and garlic mashed potatoes.  Steak was good, side dishes were a joke.  Macaroni and mashed potatoes served in a cup, much smaller than a coffee cup.  Got to be kidding me, served on huge plate that was 70 % empty.   Side dishes got cold in 5 minutes, metal cup helped.  Mrs had 2 alcoholic beverages with dinner, cost 32 dollars, really  ?  Had extremely loud group of 20 two tables away from us, screaming and shouting for about 40 minutes while some man performed magic tricks for them.  I gave this place a one star, only for my steak, and the service was good.  Never again.	0.0

We ordered the fried pickles and the coconut shrimp for appetizers.   Pickles were great, and the shrimp was also good, but very greasy.   The salad was iceberg on a plate with 2 tomatoes, 2 cucumbers, and a ton of croutons.   Never got the dinner rolls, ok though since we really didn't need them.   We ordered two prime rib dinners (medium), one rib dinner, and a NY strip medium rare.   Both orders of prime rib were very well done, and the steak was very raw.  I wanted to ask for new prime rib, but my father insisted they would eat it anyway.  If you have nothing but very well done prime rib available, at least let your guests know and give the option to order something else.  After waiting about 15 minutes, my steak was cooked longer, and was actually very good.   While my partner thought his ribs were great,  I have had better at chain restaurants.   The ""fire roasted corn on the cob"" was boiled frozen corn, and tiny.   I know corn isn't in season, but when it's clearly frozen and boiled,  at least get some decent cobs!   Maybe throw them on the grill to ""fire roast"" then.   The other sides (baked beans, mashed potatoes, and loaded baked) were average.   The entire meal lasted about 30 minutes (15 minutes for appetizer, salad,  meals,  and 15 minutes to reheat my steak)...we were rushed quicker than a McDonalds.  Sad because there were only a few tables on a Thursday night.   This establishment is obviously overpriced and not worth the money if you only rely on the food, it's a tourist trap.   You need to pay the musician, the magician, and the 20 staff members in the restaurant somehow.   Speaking of the magician, that is why this place gets the stars.  After our lackluster meal and service, he amazed us with table side magic for 10 minutes.  Sad that an awesome magician is the star of a steakhouse, rather than the food."	4.0

It literally taints the whole park, which is really a shame. Just seemed really bad business practice. We were prepared to spend some real cash, too. The food might be great, for all I know, but the service is unbelievably poor. I don't like restaurants that treat their customers like replaceable objects. Wish I could give this place a zero for the same amount of service that I received. If I owned this place, I'd be REALLY upset! Table for seven, and you turn us away because you're full?

When she sat us down, our server came by and asked for drinks when we just barely sat down, haven't even looked at the menu yet so just ordered water.  

 During the time my mother and I waited for our meal, we could hear the female bartender having a conversation with one of the guests of how she loves to party, doesn't know who her daughters father is and how she hates getting low tips from customers.  Her and the guest were flirty and the entire conversation was entirely inappropriate. 

 Our meal finally came, by the manager himself, not our actual server.  The manager did NOT carry a tray for our food, he had each hand with a plate. As he was putting my mothers meal on the table, he stuck his thumb in her hamburger as he was setting the plate down.. EEEWWW!!!! Then he sat my plate down, all of my meal looked dried out, and it tasted like it too.  I asked the manager for lemon slices before he left so I can add it to my water (ended up using it on the food instead).

 A few minutes went by and the server came by and asked us how our meal was, I said ""It's just ok."" As it was. He didn't ask why it was just ok, he just walked away and left. Once our meals were done, he gave us a check, had the card sitting on it to have it taken and took forever to get out of there.  Then my mom asked about the hamburger she ordered to go, if we will be getting it anytime soon... he forgot it, figures. Will NEVER come back there and would never recommend.

My thought was manager needed to work with staff. However, we gave it a second chance and my opinion has changed.  I don't think the manager needs to work with staff.  I think the manager needs to be replaced with someone that will work with staff.

There's a reason there are so many negative views regarding service.  To begin with our server had no clue what was on the menu.  She didn't know where to find the side dishes on it or what or where the soup was listed.  We're guessing she was put on the floor not knowing what the restaurant served.  She wanted to take our order without us knowing what our choices were.  We were pretty frazzled just dealing with her.  Finally we suggested she get someone who did know.  So she finally ran off to find someone else to help (i.e. server #2).   

Order was finally taken as we had opted for the 2 for $25 choices.  This time the food was mostly good.  Most places you're offered dipping choices for onion rings, etc.  Not here.  We asked for ranch dressing to dip and was told we got BBQ sauce or they charged an extra 50 cents.  Not the idea so much of the amount but never have ever had an upcharge for a ranch dip replacement.

We waited for what seemed like a long time for our onion ring appetizer.  When it did come we were sure it had sat in the kitchen for a while.  Our meal arrived almost on top of the onion rings.  The meal was cooked perfectly but the service was so lousy it was hard to have a good attitude.

We were asked how it was by server #2 after we were finished.  Server #1  never stopped to check and the question by server #2 was as she was walking by.  I'd say it was a little late to do much about it if the steak wasn't cooked right.

Tracking down a server to get their attention so we could get our tab was another issue.

The manager, Jason I believe, came to the table. This is when the evening took a turn for the worse. He came over with an accusatory attitude, claiming he didn't know where the hair came from, as all the cooks are bald. We never once asked for anything free, simply the plate remade. As we have both worked food service, we both know the hair could have come from prep, or another waitress, such as the one who delivered the food. However, as he was on the opposite side of the table from me, and the hair was straight (my hair is naturally kinky curly), it was impossible to have been mine. The manager felt the need to state 'for all I know, the hair could have come from this table'. That was a direct quote. That was absolutely unacceptable. After telling him I didn't wish to speak to him anymore, and the number for his supervisor, he became very argumentative, and once again accusatory. I told him multiple times I didn't wish to speak with him, yet he insisted on standing right there yelling and speaking down to me and my family. My husband didn't even get a bite out of his steak, yet we were accused of putting hair in the food. That makes absolutely no sense. As we have both worked food service, we understood accidents happen. With a new plate of food, the issue would have been resolved. The manager coming over to blame us for the hair, was not ok.	1.0

My boyfriend and I had a new waitress who was the sweetest girl ever, she was no where near the problem. Our food took 35 minutes to come out and was cold, didn't have much sauce on top, and looked like it had been sitting for hours. We requested to leave but insisted to stay due to the manager. The manager came and didn't seem to care much at all. He said he would take down our check slightly due to inconvenience and assured us the food would be out in under 5 minutes. Around 18 minutes later our new wings had came out. They were the same exact wings, sauceless and looked as if they were thrown in the oven for 3 minutes if that. They still were cold so we requested the bill and to leave. We paid and shortly realized he didn't comp anything and in fact charged us for our drinks twice! Mine of which were free refills and my boyfriend finished his one and then requested water. It's a shame I've been coming here loyally since I was a little girl and it took this one unfair experience to change my outlook. They overcharged us, gave us cold/old food, and took over and hour for wings that were very poor looking. I've had nothing other than the boneless wings my entire life so I know how they normally look. This place doesn't honor the customer is always right policy most places do and could've cared less about us. The waitress felt so bad and did everything she could so we thank her! The manager didn't make anything right and never came back to check to see how it was the second go around. I highly don't recommend this location as the manager is terrible. My review is 0/5 stars for this visit.	0.0

They did not even make a brand new one. I had cut it in half and got the same one back on a new bun. Manager was just hanging out with current and ex employees who we're being loud and obnoxious burping and yelling.The glassware was dirty as well. I won't ever come back to this one.	2.0

I think today was my last time voluntarily eating at an Applebee's. I love you blondie but I just can't anymore.
My three cheese chicken pasta had lettuce in it. I'm not allergic to lettuce or anything but I don't like it. It is really gross biting into a crunchy piece of lettuce totally unexpected and it also doesn't mix well with pasta FYI. 
There were about 3 pieces. It just makes me wonder what the heck is going on in the kitchen ya know? 
I did eat a little over half of it when I came upon the lettuce pieces
I told my waitress and I would have liked another one made at the very least. At that point I was ready to leave so I didn't bother making a fuss over it. I really wasn't that surprised since it's not the first time my dish has been messed up at an Applebee's.   I didn't even take my leftovers because of the lettuce so I do feel a little gypped."	0.0

Ordered the appetizers ""Classic Combo"" which included mozzarella sticks, spinach/artichoke dip, nacho chips, cheese quesadillas.  It was a plentiful dish at happy hour pricing.  I found the dip to be a bit salty although I usually love salty things.  Another diner ordered the mozzarella sticks which were typical ""mozzarella"" sticks.  Nothing special, nothing bad.  They were, however, sizably portioned.  

Now comes the bad. 

I ordered the fried shrimp combo which comes with coleslaw and french fries.  I asked to get a baked potato instead of fries.  The platter arrived and the shrimp were small and chunky, meaning they were not butterflied.  The proportion of batter to shrimp was a little heavy.  The cole slaw tasted fresh.  The baked potato seemed to have something oily on the outside and salt.  I have had baked potatoes before at other restaurants (Red Lobster) which were salted on the outside, but that was not what looked strange.  The potato was yellowish on the inside and had some ""watery"" stuff inside.  It was not butter.  I tasted it and gave it a second and third tasting just to try to determine why it looked and tasted so differently (it almost didn't taste like a baked potato).  As an experienced cook, I figuered it out.  They used an eastern potato which is an inexpensive, high water content potato which should never be baked if indeed you want a great tasting baked potato.  Further, I think they boiled it first and then baked it which caused it to be even more watery.  A good idaho potato (which is what should have been used)  is a starchy potato which bakes beautifully and absorbs butter or sour cream whatever is your fancy.  They are also more expensive which is probably why it was not used.
I told the waitress about the ""baked"" potato and she had a gentleman come over and I explained the issue.  He asked me what I would like to substitute and I selected garlic mashed potatoes which BTW turned out to be delicious.   Later on another gentlemen came by to ask if everything had been resolved.  
The Triple Chocolate Melt came with Vanilla ice cream which was delicious and big enough to share. 

So I am giving one star for Courtney F. our server who was efficient and courteous, and one for the management for correcting the baked potato issue.  However, I was still very disappointed with the quality of the shrimp I was served as I was truly looking forward to a good shrimp platter."	1.0

I was waiting for my friend to arrive, but he still did not come back to even ask what I wanted to drink. I sat there for 20 minutes (my friend finally arrived by then) before he came over to see what we wanted. After being starving from not eating much all day, my patience was pretty thin. After waiting so long, what I wanted was a sincere apology, but instead he tried to brush it off with some humor instead. I never got a refill on my drink even once. The waiter also acted extremely unprofessional and talked to us like one of his ""buds."" I asked him if something on the menu was good and he even said ""I try not to eat where I work so I don't really know.""

They blamed everything on it being their $1.00 margaritas that were causing it to be extremely slow.

We ordered the chips and salsa for our appetizer, salad, and a burger.  It literally took them 25 min to bring out our chips and salsa and another 20 to bring out our entrees.  The salad looks like a salad on the Wendy's dollar menu and the burger was so plain it was unbelievable (see my photos).

My friends like to do happy hour and this place is by their work. They used to offer mudslides, sangria and other amazing drinks but now they have taken all that away. It's gotten to the point that there is pretty much nothing on happy hour anymore. I think they offered a margarita, two wines and a few straight liquors. 

The food is super salty and there is almost no flavor to it. I usually get an artichoke dip if that. Though recently they added pretzel rolls with beer cheese and that is actually pretty good. Though, how could you screw up cheese?! 

Last time we went, there was no hostess. My friend waited a solid five minutes before we asked a bartender for help. The only saving grace of this place is the wait staff.

Yelp Review 
Hooters 
455 N 3rd St #190
Phoenix, AZ 85004


I have always been a huge fan of Hooters wings, their drinks, and of course their fun exciting atmosphere. After a long day at work, my boyfriend and I went to grab our favorite wings, sliders, and refreshments. It was about 9 at night, the game just went off, so the restaurant was starting to calm down. So as my boyfriend and I walk into Hooters, we had to wait for about 10 minutes just to be seated, several employees pranced passed us, while not one even said a word to us. So eventually I just said ,let's seat ourselves. 
Now I am a firm believer that if a place of business does not greet you within the first 90 seconds then your business is unwanted.But since I had a long day at work, I was not in the mood to deal with the downtown traffic or find a new place to eat. So as soon as we seated ourselves , a girl came rushing out saying ""you usually have to wait and be seated by someone, your not suppose to seat yourself"" in a very negative tone. Then she walked away, and turned back and said ""I guess I'll find someone to service you"". 20 minutes went by, and no one has bothered to serve us. No water, a hello, or how are you doing this evening. My boyfriend became angry and whistled to the waiter at the table behind us outside on the patio, and asked for two glasses of water with lemon.  She came back and brought two cups of water, without lemon. I asked the waiter for lemon and she never came back. Another 10 minutes went by , so we have been sitting outside for about 30 minutes without being served or greeted properly.
 A girl finally came, and asked us for our drink order, then we both replied we just want food. As we ordered our food, the waiter was very rude, and was constantly rolling her eyes. After she went to put the order in, she came back in 4 minutes and handed my boyfriend and I our bill. Before even receiving our food. We instantly felt we were getting racially profiled, and treated unfairly because we looked young.So I instantly asked to speak with the manger. While waiting I got up, and asked every table surrounding us , did your waiter make you pre pay before receiving your meal? Every table responded with a no, and became frustrated because they saw how bad we were getting treated. So the manager walks out and I asked him, so is this your protocol for having customers pre pay before receiving their meal, because everyone around us did not have to prepay for their meals. He replied"" this is a new policy in place, please forgive me and my team because this is fairly new"". I said well sir, where is this written down at since this is your new policy? He responded it was just put in place last week, so the marketing material has not been sent in. I said well sir, then how is a rule going to be put in place if you have no formal documentation. He responded saying, well once it gets here I could email it. I instantly became angry because although this may be a ""policy"" then you should make sure you and your team should follow through, and treat every customer equal. He said I apologize could I get you something to drink, on the house.  
I am not sure why he asked because we already paid for our food and drinks, so what could you offer us in exchange for the poor service.  So our food came out and we took it to go. Once we got home, there was no dressing for the wings, we ordered all flats and got a mixture of all types of wings, our sliders did not have the proper toppings, and we were given fries instead of a salad as the side. 
Our experience, was definitely horrible, I would not recommend going to the Hooters on 455 N 3rd St #190, Phoenix, AZ 85004. The service is horrible, the employees are rude, and the manager has horrible customer service skills. They are in desperate need of a customer service training.  DO NOT GO THERE. TAKE YOUR SERVICE SOMEWHERE ELSE. I spent way too much money on food that was worth $5 or less. I would give them 1 star out of 5, just because the lemonade was very refreshing."	0.0

As we walked out he said we have insurance if you get sick. His whole attitude was an embarrassment to hooters. We did get sick, had to take the day off work. We called the manager and he just berated us for not going to the hospital. Well we knew what to do because we're adults. He said he would file a claim but nothing. We shouldn't have had to take a day off because of his mistake. Additionally his whole lack of concern and completely horrible attitude makes all of hooters look bad!	2.0

She gave me the check again no apology or thanks for coming or anything. The manager I think even came to apologize. He was nice about it and offered to box our food but we had to go.

Host then got us waters and said our waitress was talking with the manager and will be with us soon. Keep in mind, more than HALF THE PLACE WAS EMPTY!!! 10 minutes later we put in our beer and food order. 15 minutes later we were served the beers after having to make eye contact with Ciara (because she was too distracted talking to co-workers.) The food took forever to get to us and what do ya know? THE ORDER WAS WRONG. Asked for no meat on the nachos and there was meat so we had to wait longer. She completely forgot about the salad and said no worries I'll fix it... Well no kidding, am I suppose to go and fix your error?! 2 hours into this and we have the correct food and really just want to leave. Were told the nacho were going to be taken care of because of the mess up.. No, the receipts (all 4 for whatever reason) were all messed up. At this point, we asked for a manager and then had to wait about 10 minutes because he was no where to be found. After getting he charges fixed we sat for nearly 20 more minutes waiting to pay our tab. We took the tab to the bar where they said we couldn't pay there! Literally the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant in the 30 years I've been alive. Worst waitress. Don't waste your time unless you want to be pissed the hell off.

These were by far the smallest portions I've ever received in years. I'm dead serious 10 boneless wings (2 sauces) and 10 shrimp (Cajun) and these pictures are all I got. It feels like they cut the wings in half and then served them to me. These were appetizer portions for a full meal price? I'm extremely disappointed. So much so I asked the manager about it. All I'm getting is a shrug and a ""blame our distributor"" reason for why the portions are so small. I'm seriously feeling like I've been cheated. For the record he offered me another order but I felt so ripped off I didn't take him up on it. I wish I had. This was really disappointing.

Husband ordered the big fish sandwich blackened and friend ordered wings.

His was not breaded

The food came out and the fish on appearance looked fried.   The lady stated that it was breaded and grilled.

I have never heard of such and as stated I ate at quite a few locations.

Soon the manager came over and stated that she can show me where it states breaded.

When actually it states blacken season mix, not breaded.

It doesn't state it on the menu which is common if something is breaded.

Also she said that it was a new item at that location for about 6 months.

I had it other locations before just 6 mo ago (but it could be new for Arizona).

I ended up sending it back, because it was not what I anticipated and didn't want breaded or battered food.   

Also since then I have been to a couple other Hooters in Phoenix and Tempe and they did not bread or batter the ""blackened"" mahi.

I've done my fair time in restaurants and hospitality and the experience I had this evening truly made me reflect on all my past experiences; good and bad. I thought long and hard about all my guest interactions from serving, bartending, managing, and even from a guest perspective and could not find a time where I encountered such incompetence, not only from the bartender who could not ""dress"" a glass, but from the manager who tried to defend her lack of knowledge by saying, ""It's easier when you have a bottle."" I don't fault someone for training; after all we all had to learn a skill sometime, but you should have the staff there to support someone who is training. If the bartender couldn't dress the glass, maybe the lazy manager should have showed her, instead of cutting out letters for the ""theme party"" tomorrow. Wait, it gets even better... So after the 20 minute attempt at dressing a mug; we gave up and ordered a bottle. Well it didn't come in a bottle, it came in a pint glass that was haphazardly dressed and thrown into a glass(you know, so the head was all salt...MMMM). My wife was nice enough to scrape it off and move on. My server who was pleasant and helpful the whole time asked if I wanted something else to drink, so I ordered a malibu, pineapple, and splash of cranberry. Now I know this drink isn't going to be hard up on the rum, but I expected a hint of coconut as I passed the drink to my wife and asked her if my taste buds were off. I then thought to myself, well it did come in a tall glass, but after the years of bartending I did for Chili's I never tasted a 1.25 oz pour that weak. I of course brought this up with the manager; Shiela, and the reply will live with me forever. ""Well you should have let your server know you wanted it in a short glass or a heavier pour."" Really? I responded, ""That is the best answer you have for me? Your bartender can't do simple things and your response is that?"" This is when I clearly poked the angry bear inside of Shiela as she then became very defensive. Citing I do not need to be condescending and speak rudely of the bartender. Have we moved past the point of simple guest satisfaction? I didn't call the bartender a complete F*** up, but wish I would have considering how upset the manager got. My point is that there was many places I could have chose to spend my money this evening with my wife and son, I ended up making a horrible decision, not based upon the food(probably the best plates to come out of the hooters kitchen in a long while), not because of the great service Jovonne gave, but because of the lack of support from the manager who should have been there to support the failing bartender and her horrible attitude."	0.0

When we arrived to the location we were informed that franchise stores such as this one do not participate in the all you can eat promotion.  What a major let down, not to mention the false advertising on their website.  All of us are in the marketing industry and there was no fine print in the website ad explaining exclusions.  We were duped.
Instead of all you can eat wings they offered 10 wings and a beer for $12.99 - hardly a deal.  And the beer had to be draft Bud, Bud Light or Michelob Ultra.

It's clear that the customer satisfaction is declining because recently I've often see the manager walking around checking on the customers. If the manager has to patrol the restaurant to make sure everyone is happy, then clearly the employees aren't doing their jobs right.

The staff of friendly, reliable waitresses as Hooters has declined considerably. When I first started going here, the waitresses were fun, friendly, and fast. Now when the waitresses serve you, you can here in their tone and see in their body language that they don't want to be here. None of them seem enthusiastic about their jobs and their attitude projects onto the customers. The only waitress that's almost always happy is the bartender. But sitting at the bar gets boring, and can get annoying when some creepy middle-aged guy is sitting next to you. If you're a good waitress I will tip you at least 20%. But the past few times I've been here I remember tipping the waitress about 10%, which is what I give for C-rated service.

The food, including it's taste and preparation, has also drastically declined. Two years ago the chicken wings would be a home run. Now they're a double, at best. This Hooters doesn't serve their mild sauce anymore. Why is beyond me. My taste is very sensitive to spicy food. Even something with a little bit of spice will detract from the taste of the food. So without their mild sauce, their least spiciest sauce is their Medium sauce, which has a little kick of spice in it. So now I can't even fully enjoy my wings.

And about 50% of the time, my food comes out luke warm, or even cold, like it's been sitting for 10 minutes waiting to be served. Which is probably what happened since the waitresses hate their jobs.

Also, this Hooters doesn't give military discounts anymore. Really, how difficult is it to give a 10% discount for service members?

It really sucks that this restaurant has declined so much over the years. I used to love going here. Now, I try to give myself reasons NOT to go here. I don't know if because the management changed or if they just have a staff of really crappy employees or if they're using cheaper ways to prepare their food. Maybe all three. But this used to be one of the best restaurants in downtown Phoenix and is now one of the worst.

I can't believe I keep coming back here with all the comparable Happy Hour options in the area. Maybe because I am a college student living on a budget and the idea of getting their $6 wing special while watching sports seems too good a deal to pass up when it crosses my mind like once or twice a month. Usually, I am disappointed by my experience because the waitresses don't keep my water glass full and it takes too damn long for the kitchen to get the food out. But today definitely takes the cake for my worst experience ever at this restaurant. After sitting at the bar waiting about 30-40 minutes for my food I noticed a male employee bring food out to the gentlemen who ordered 10 minutes after I did. I was mildly fuming because it looked like he had ordered the same thing I did. When the bartender came over around to him and said ""Oh sorry I thought you had ordered bone in wings."" And she takes his plate and as she walks by reassures me that my food is coming. Girl: I am not an idiot, I can tell that your manager brought my food out to someone else and the kitchen staff would have to start over on my order. Own up to it: Get the manager over to apologize to me and offer me some kind of discount. She never even came over to explain to me the situation and offer to make up for it herself. Soon the guy who originally got my order received the food he ordered and I was sitting there at the bar with a phone that was now out of battery, pretending to watch the NFL Network. The waitress apologized again and I asked her point blank if the other guy had been given my food. She said yes but did not offer me anything to make up for the shitty experience. And how much longer it would take to get my retired order? After going to check with the kitchen she assured me it would only be 4 minutes. I waited for 8 minutes, watching as food came flying out of the kitchen. Not my order...

Eat some of the wings and do some squats. 2) They increased the price of the endless wings for the new year yet the wings got smaller. The manager said that it is because they are being charged more. They might want to think about changing suppliers then. 3) To charge for every ranch dressing is asinine. We asked for one ranch each and she brought us a ranch every time we got our next plate of six tiny wings. Never did our server Ashlea tell us we were going to have to pay for each ranch that we did not even ask for. At least the beer was good and at a decent price. I think we will stick to Zipps!	0.0

Knowing this, this time I ordered the buffalo chicken sammich and my friend ordered some cheese sticks. Now the sandwich only comes with beans or coleslaw, to add French fries is extra. So I scrapped the beans/slaw and got the fries. I'll address the cheese sticks first. My friend got the puniest, most pitiful looking cheese sticks I've ever seen. She said they weren't all that great (which is really sad cause its hard to mess us cheese sticks right?). My sandwich came with some curly fries that were horrible. They looked as if they hadn't been cooked long enough (they were white instead of that golden brown we all know and love), and some seasoning salt was sprinkled on top in an effort to distract me from how terrible they were. The sandwich though, was actually decent. There was a huge chicken breast patty dipped in buffalo sauce, sitting on top of a bun. So I enjoyed the sammich, but pretty much hated everything else. 

customer service was good, hence the two stars. If it wasn't for that, they wouldn't have gotten any. The beer was good and cold...like it was posed to be. The place was LOUD too...which actually worked in my favor and helped to distract my kid. Other than that, I don't really have many good things to say about this place. Umm...it was clean. Yup.

They bumped up the cost of meters, or you can park down the road in the expensive lot. Add to this the high cost of wings with NO MEAT on them. None, seriously, anorexic little chickens all wingless for this place. And I like smaller, less fatty wings. But I also like meat. And I do not want to spend $10 on an order of wings that result in one tablespoon of meat. Second issue is that the outdoor smoking section opens into the restaurant and stinks the place up.

My friend and I were super excited today for Wing Wednesday ($9.99 all you can eat wings). We walk in and are greeted instinctively but the female bartender who also tells us to sit wherever. I choose a table next to the double doors that leads to the outside seating area. For 10 minutes we sat there without even so much as eye contact or a smile from any of the waitresses. I see that there are two moderate groups outside (6-8 people each), but don't give it a second thought. Still no acknowledgment from anybody. After 15 minutes, my buddy walks up two managers who were fiddling with a tv monitor and 3 other waitresses surrounding them. My buddy goes, ""Umm, can we get some service??"" The female manager immediately appoints someone to go to our table. 

This blondie informs us that **Brittany** is our waitress, but she would take our first order. A few minutes after she takes our order, the lovely Brittany shows up. We had already watched this girl walk right past our table about 10 times back and forth prior to talking to the managers. She apologizes, like a child whose been forced to do so, for ""not seeing"" us. A) Simple acknowledgment would have sufficed. B) My buddy is a BIG tall guy with a mohawk wearing a bright red shirt. How the heck could she not have seen us? She then makes a pathetic attempt to explain that she got slammed, and says that she will now take our order. I tell her that our orders have already been taken. We get our first round of wings in a fair amount of time after the order was put in by Blondie. I asked for ranch and never got it. My buddy's cajun wings were too salty so he only ended up eating 6 wings. Brittany came back and only asked to refill my friend's drink. He told her Mr. Pibb, and she brought back coke. She took his plate away and didn't bother to ask if he wanted more wings since it was all you can eat. He's a big guy!!! Oh that's right. She didn't take our order so of course she didn't know. Shortly after I finished my own round of wings. Typically, the girls will see that you have finished your wings halfway and immediately ask you if you want the next round put it. No one asked us this. So I finished my wings and asked my friend if he wanted to go or keep hoping that the service will improve. BTW, those big tables were long gone by then. It was actually pretty empty by then. The whole time we just watched Brittany try to calculate her tabs and collect her tips. 

My friend wanted out, and he said he'll refuse to pay if they asked us. We head straight to the door and NO ONE bothered trying to stop us. Instead we heard Brittany,""Sorry guys."" as we left. They knew what was going on. This is the very worst service that I have ever had. I would have still tipped had we stayed til the end, but it was so terrible. My wings weren't even that great. 

If you come here, and you get a girl that is tan, has shoulder length curly hair, and is named Brittany, ask for another waitress."	4.0

I have been coming to this Hooters for years now. There hasn't been a time where I have had a bad experience here. The food has always been on point, customer service was not bad, and really nothing to complain about. I've always ordered the medium/hot wings along with the curly fries with cheese and a side salad. I've brought friends with me on several occasions, and they never had anything negative to say.

It's been a month or so that I've been here and decided to try the take out. Same order same expectations. Now I know every business will have their bad days but this is the first time here that has probably made me decide I will not return.
I open the to go boxes and let's just say I was surprised. The fries looked extremely dull and I picked one up to try it; cold. Cold, dull fries that had an old taste to them. Not like they were sitting around but old as if they were out for a long time. Super soggy and just absolutely terrible. The wings were undercooked and the hot sauce that I usually get tasted bland and cold. It was as if they just battered them up with canned sauce. No flavor, and not the amazing wings I usually get there. I am thinking is this really the place I talk so good about?
I read the negative reviews thinking this is not true. I now believe the ""hype"" regarding the issues they are having here. It's amazing how down under it has gotten since I've last been here. It's not like the food was waiting for a long time, I got there before it was even ready.

Honestly, I am extremely disappointed. The manager was not much help and that just comes to show how down under this business is heading to. I don't know what else to say, 30$ that has gone to waste. Ate a few of the fries and maybe half of a wing that was disgusting.

To simply put it, it is very unlikely that I will return anytime soon. The negative reviews didn't lie."	1.0

Now I have had taco salad all over the country.  This one was different. Maybe I did not read the entire explanation of what this dish was, but usually a taco salad is pretty basic and is composed with several basic items. This taco salad had a scant few. It was a pile of shredded lettuce over some cabbage, swimming in a vinaigrette dressing with a sprinkle of cheese, a small scoop of guacamole and sour cream and four taco chips. It was more like a mediocre dinner salad, overdressed with toppings that did not suit what a dinner salad should be....with a couple of taco chips.

We ordered the all-you-can-eat fish and chips with extra crispy fries.  What we got was VERY extra crispy fish with tarter sauce that was so thin it dripped off the fish when we dipped the fish in it.  The fries were limp and the coleslaw tasted old and somewhat rotten.  When the waitress came by we asked if the fish is usually this dark.  She said they were going to change the oil, which would take a while, but she would bring more out after the oil was changed.  She came back after speaking with the manager who said they will not be able to change the oil as quickly as they wanted, so they will not charge us for the fish and to choose another meal.  She did bring us two baskets of extra crispy fries.  We each ordered the Philly cheese steak sandwich, which turned out pretty good.

He said no because it was already on one TV, and pointed to the TV at the opposite end of the bar where the only other people in the place were sitting.  

We moved to a table that had a fair view of the TV and he took our order.  It appeared that the idea of having to wait on anybody was the most painful thing he had ever experienced.  We got our beer, which was not very cold and ordered food.  He was unfamiliar with menu, but our food came as ordered.  It was okay, typical bar food.  I finished my beer at the midpoint of the first half and it wasn't until half time that he asked if I would like another, by that point I had decided we would be moving to another establishment with far better service to spend our money. If the place was packed, I could understand it, but it was far from that.

Wings are baked and not fried, why bother offering them. The waitress brought the wrong style of wings after making the recommendation for said style and then acted like she did us a favor not charging us for the portion we returned (they charged us for the portion they did finally bring). The bbq pork sand wedge was pretty fantastic along with the sweet potato fries. The fish n chips would have been rejected by a McDonald's (huge chunk of cartilage or whatever in each piece) beer selection is made by someone who clearly prefers mixed drinks. Great place if you want to save money on a tip!	0.0

Today we had several bad experiences that resulted in is leaving before we were served our meal. First, we ordered an appetizer and it took 25 minutes to arrive. The appetizer. Second, we were given two different kids menus. When we ordered an item off the menu (kids pasta) we were told they didn't have it anymore. After a few minutes we ordered something different only to be told they didn't have the side we asked for (fruit! ON THE MENU) Settled on mashed potatoes... They think they have those! 5 minutes later the server came back and said they don't have those either. He said the menu has changed some! They took the firecracker burger off and people were mad about it, he said. I asked why they changed- new chef? New owner? No, I think the owner just wanted to shake things up, he said. He also said he heard not everything changed at all locations, just some! Whatever...
We were there after the lunch rush- one of only two tables the entire time. 
25 minutes after ordering our APPETIZER, it finally came. (Oh by the way- no Alfredo sauce anymore, only pizza sauce for the garlic knots. Menu changed, apparently)
40 minutes after ordering our ENTRÉES, my husband kindly told them we would pay for our appetizer and drinks but that we did not want the food and we would be leaving. They food just happened to be ready, so they boxed it up for us and sent it with us. 
The entire time we sat there we only saw our server when we ordered, when he came to tell us something we ordered was not on the menu, or when he brought drinks/appetizer. No checking on our drink refill status or apologizing for the ridiculously long wait.
The food was mediocre. My burger was not medium, nor was it hot. The garlic knots were smaller than they used to be and not soft (overlooked like the burger, maybe?)
I tend to give people the benefit of the doubt, and really hate to give a negative review to anyone, but this one got me fired up today. 
Hate that for ya, Fat Willy. We were big fans before today, but you lost our business and we will likely share our experience if your name ever comes up in conversation with our friends."	2.0

The other girl came by to say sorry and the manager said we can get an app on them. We got our food and the server asked if she could get me another beer. I said sure. 20 minutes later we were done eating and she said ohhhh u ordered another beer. I said just bring the check. She brought the check and never returned to collect payment. My boyfriend finally got up and ask someone to cash us out. The app was never taken off however that was the least of out worries. Bummed that the sucked.

Recently it seems to be getting worse.  Their system of ""anybody who is close is your wait staff"" just doesn't work.  We never feel like anyone really understands customer service.

My biggest issue is that when they brought my veggie plate, the baby carrots appeared to be AT LEAST 2 weeks old. They were completely soft and flexible and white.  I'm not exaggerating. It was disgusting. When the waitress came back I calmly asked her ""Excuse me, but I'm just wondering, do you think these are appropriate to serve?"". She was shocked and apologized and said she would talk to the manager.  A few minutes later another waitress brought out a plate with about 5 new baby carrots on it.  They never asked to clear the spoiled ones- leaving them on the table the entire meal, and the manager never came over at all to even check it out.  My real gripe is that obviously no one was paying attention to what they were serving, and more importantly, the manager didn't even care to come apologize for serving spoiled food.

My smaller issue was the timing of our food being served. I ordered the appetizer veggie plate and nachos and specifically said they would be my meal.  My son ordered a 9"" cheese pizza, which came out about 5 minutes after my food.  My husband ordered a burger which came out 5 minutes after my sons (10 minutes after mine).  It was not even remotely busy- there were maybe 2 other occupied tables in the restaurant section total.  It wasn't the end of the world, but definitely longer than it should have been.

My husband didn't like his Southwest burger at all. Said the flavor of the BBQ was too sweet and he said the patties were pre made {pet peeve for both of us} but edible.

However, its a convenient location and the beer is cold so I keep  coming back when in the area for beer... I met 2 friends here for Thursday night NFL Kickoff to watch some football and have some drinks. The bartender and the staff is always friendly and courteous, and the place has a pretty good vibe to it. 
After we had a couple brews my friends said they were hungry, and I also started getting a appetite. I had warned them that this place is notorious for having bad food from personal experiences... They said they wanted to get chow here. My buddy asked the waitress what was good, and of course she said ""everything"".... He got the fish and chips, and the waitress applauded his choice by saying its their best seller on Fridays. I got the French dip, and another friend got the Philly cheese steak. 
Best way to explain the fish and chips was **In Donald Trumps voice** ""SAD""... It joked with the waitress and asked if todays catch was bluegill since he got 3 tiny pieces of fish that looks like was flattened out before being battered.. It looked disgusting. The waitress apologized and said ""yeah, I saw that... Fridays we have better fish"". I asked her what that meant? Throughout the week they serve goldfish and on Fridays they sell the cod??? She took it as a joke and moved on..
My French dip looked **in Donald Trumps Voice** ""worst trade deal I ever made"". I could not believe I paid my hard earned money for this. There was barely any meat or fries. I swear I felt like they hired someone just to count the fries to make sure everyone gets just enough to be let down and disappointed... I have half the roll left over because it didn't have enough meat to reach the ends. 
My friend that got the Philly I think was trying to be nice. She said oh its good..... and only ate half. The waitress told her there is a white sauce that comes on it, and she didn't know if she would like it or not so she asked for it on the side. When it came out, it was clearly queso... I was like Whaaaa..... Why...... Again, on her plate she seemed to just have enough fries to think the plate came with a discount.

The food was barely mediocre. I got a turkey, bacon, and avocado wrap that was so salty it covered the taste of everything else. My husband got a French dip that was bland. My onion rings were also really salty and were soggy. I was kicking myself wishing we had gone to Wildflower or Paradise down the street for something lighter and fresher.

We went on Burger Monday so we weren't surprised that the place was full but we could see 2 empty tables going unbussed while we waited. They also apparently have a policy of quoting a half hour wait for a table on mondays even if they have several that just need cleared. This makes no sense to me. 

Once we were seated we quickly realized that the tables were not getting cleared because our waiter didn't really feel like working. He stood up near the door socializing for a good 10 minutes at a time until he eventually seated a girl near us so he could visit with her. We had to ask twice for condiments and drained our drinks completely and had a bit of a wait before we could get the waiter to refill for us. 

We also both thought the boothes were uncomfortable. We felt like we were a mile from the table but also the back of the booth tilts forward at the top and it pushes taller people the exact opposit of the normal, comfortable seating position where you're tilted back a bit. 

At least one of the tables that was empty when we arrived remained uncleared the entire time we were there. Thanks to the policy of telling people there's a 30 minute wait though, no one was waiting for tables anymore. I think they all left. I kind of wish I'd gone with them."	6.0

Then my husband went to pick up his drink, and the lid wasn't properly on the cup and it spilled all over him and his food. Lastly, not knowing that pretzel buns are only for hotdogs, I asked for one on my chicken sandwich and they used 2 hotdog buns and didn't even tell me they don't offer sandwich pretzel buns. Plus, they charged me 2 extra dollars for this creation. This isn't the first time I've had issues with this Sonic. Something is ALWAYS screwed up in the order or the location is out of ice cream.

The cheese enchiladas (my childhood favorite) taste the same.  The food has always been good.  I've watched this tiny family business grow across the valley into these big fancy places. I have always been a fan. 
Tonight...I was severely disappointed in the extremely poor service.  The margarita was weak, and far inferior to other Mexican restaurants. 
Hope they get their act together...because I would like to be a fan again...someday"	1.0

The fajitas had a fifth of the meat that Garcias usually serves to us.

The last time we went we ordered the green chili chimichanga and the chile relleno it was very good except for the canned refried beans. That said the cocktail server man in the bar is a jackass. On several occasions he's overcharged us and he's just downright rude. We decided to give it another try because my friend said he is no longer there. Mr. Jackass is still there we're done being treated poorly and won't be returning. Do yourself a favor and go somewhere else.	0.0

I thought that sounded good and from the description was expecting grilled and seasoned peppers and onions. What I got was not grilled or fajitas. It was literally just steamed broccoli, cauliflower, and carrots. They were completely unseasoned and legitimately looked like they were from a bag of frozen vegetables. My boyfriends non-vegetarian food was fine. I get that you can't expect a Mexican place to cater to vegetarians but selling frozen steamed veggies as ""fajitas"" is not acceptable."	1.0

I'll be honesty and say that I have never paid a cover charge to go in for happy hour, but it was a birthday party so we paid.  It was not crowded but it seemed noticeable that the one male server in the bar and the one bartender were overwhelmed.  In a short time it just got worse.  Understaffed on a Friday, and a holiday weekend not a great evening.  In a short time there were up to four people in the bar and still one male server on the floor.  One little girl was washing glasses, and two managers were trying to help and it look like even a chef came to help.  The fans were dirty and then they turned them on.

I was iffy about this place all together because I usually go to the original Garcia's on 35th ave in Encanto. Well, when we first got there, they sat us close to a whole bunch of people.. I'm sure that restaurant is bigger and they can spread us out a bit.. We gave him our order and what not and they brought the food back pretty fast. When I received my chimichanga enchilada style, they gave me like a teaspoon of sour cream and very little rice (which is my favorite :( ..) I'm used to restaurants giving a good heaping serving. Well not even halfway through my meal, I asked the man if he could give me a little more because they didn't give me much the first time. When I received my bill, he ended up charging me for more sour cream. I tried explaining to him that he gave me a tiny bit in the first place. He told me he needed to speak to his manager about it.. I'm like really dude, for some sour cream? Well he ended up taking 50 cents off the bill.. Seriously........50 cents? Would it really hurt the restaurant to give me more sour cream? This isn't a big issue because the food was okay.. The customer service just sucked and I won't be going back..	1.0

We entered the establishment only to find the lobby deserted.  We stood there for a couple of minutes, then I started down the hallway to where the hostess was having what must have been a very important conversation with another employee.  Body language says a lot and it was clear that I was interrupting her.  She told us it would be 10 minutes, at 3:30, on a Sunday.  
After a few minutes they led us to a half-table / half-booth.  I took the booth side.  While I was sitting, I noticed all of the crumbs, crayons, and crap along the edge of the cushion.  Once seated, my rear-end noticed how worn out the booth truly was.  I commented to my wife, who told me that her chair felt like it was going to fall apart.  
Then we both noticed the sticky table, and the fact that it wobbled with little provocation.  
I understand that things wear out.  I also understand that, when your business is in the restaurant industry, you must deal with that wear and tear, not just ignore it.  
Since it was impossible not to wonder about the condition of the kitchen, given the condition of what we could see (and feel), we were out the door before they could serve us chips and salsa."	1.0

Jen and I had a great experience at the Garcia's in the AZ Mills mall so after a long day of running around and checking out the home show at the stadium in Glendale, Jen, my brother Bill, and I, decided to eat at the Garcia's in Glendale.

I told Jen earlier in the day that some of the littler ""dive"" or ""mom and pop"" places have some of the best food.  First impression aside (mostly empty parking lot that needs an extreme makeover), we entered the lobby already occupied by a family of 7 seated and waiting. No hostess. Bartender in the other room looked at us then turned around and walked away.  We sat for about 2 minutes 2nd guessing ourselves wondering what time they opened. After another 2 minutes I walked into the bar area which had 4 people. 2 customers at the bar, the bartender, and another employee eating.  I stood there being ignored by the bartender and made eye contact with the hungry employee. I asked what time they opened they answered 11 am which spawned the question what we had to do to get seated. The bartender came out to the lobby and with a bewildered look counted out 2 menues.  We pointed at the family of 7 stating they were here first.  The bartender commented that he wasn't sure where to sit us.  I worked in restaurants for just over 21 years and if the bartender doesn't know how to seat a table then they are either a poor employee or the manager is poor employeeand didn't train them well enough. Most 14 or 15 year olds can handle that job we decided to just leave at that point.  I was pretty pissed off. 5 minutes may not seem like long time.  Well  it is.

Upon entering I decided to sit at the bar which was quite large however I was the only person sitting there which seemed a bit odd. The bartender was friendly enough however there seemed to be a lot of staff just milling around doing nothing.

After ordering a Sol I placed my order to have the Carnitas tacos served without onions. Chips, salsa and a bean dip were served prior to the meal coming out. The  salsa was amazing and some of the freshest I've had but the bean dip just basically tasted like refried beans.

The Carnitas tacos came out and looked nice on the plate however the plate felt like it was about 150° which likely means it was flash heated to melt cheese. The result was the rice was dried out and the tacos were lacking any real flavor."	2.0

She did bring out the hot salsa when I asked for it, and took our order. 

After our food hit the table, the next time we saw her was to drop off the check.  At this point, I guess that she didn't want any more of our money for desert.

Brought my family there for my son's 8th grade promotion. Not overly busy but obviously not staffed well. Was told 30 minute wait for my party of 9. 50 minutes later we were still patiently waiting when a party of 20 came in and asked to be seated. They were given an hour wait time, but was seated before us. We walked out. The hostess was immature and not one soul came to us to say how much longer we would wait. It was a slap in the face to be such gracious and patient guests, waiting to be treated to an average meal and then be passed for a larger party. Poor quality service.

The tacos hardly had any meat in it and when I asked about it a female manager couldn't explain if it was normal for them to put so little meat in the taco then she offered to bring me more meat instead of making me a fresh taco and when the meat came out in a bowl it was warm not hot and the shredded beef was flavorless and so was the chicken in the taco but I ate that anyway but  not flavorful at all it was like Denny's but Mexican style. Then my son orders Mac and she and a cup of fruit the fruit isn't fresh it's a pre packaged fruit cup you buy at the store with pears and peaches in it it reminded me of a packaged fruit cup they give kids at school not happy about that at all! So I told my waiter I didn't like my food and he offered me something else to eat and as he is picking up my plate he says "" I guess you weren't hungry ""I thought that was rude. Just because someone isn't happy with the food doesn't mean they weren't hungry it means they didn't like the food period. On the bright side the chips were good and the tortilla soup was good but sad to say we won't be back.

The floor was dirty with food under the tables etc.  the waitress was less than enthused to be serving us and as we had additional members presenting at our party she continually was irritated that she has to take additional drink orders from us bc more people showed up.  She would disappear for long periods of time and then when we stayed later to talk it was another irritation. The food was not that appealing and the side of black beans tasted bad and bitter.  The food was hot but felt like it was microwaved before coming out. For the money and the cost of the meal I would of rather gone to a fast food place like chipotle and had cleaner service better ingredients etc.  I will not be coming back. I'm not sure why phoenix has all these Mexican restaurants which are long term establishments that go bad.  Like at one time I'm sure it was a family run great place where people would go to enjoy a nice family restaurant meal. But over time they have fallen into disrepair/mis management/ bad staff and poor food quality.

First, it was too hot inside.  I am not one of those ladies that gets too hot or too cold and complains all the time; it was ridiculously hot at our booth.  Second, the waiter told me that he didn't know why they listed some of the wines on the wine list because they don't have them.  There were 6 chardonnays to choose from and then he said they had none.  The beer I settled for arrived in a glass that was not chilled and it was not cold enough to enjoy so I left half of it.  The chicken on the plate was tough and dry but smothered in cream cheese sauce.  My date ordered a side salad which arrived with no dressing.  He wanted a salad instead of rice and beans, but the waiter didn't quite understand and brought out one dry salad before his meal- he had to ask for dressing.  Finally, the prices are just too high!  Each of our meals was $11.99 and each beer was $4.25 on a Friday night at 5:30 pm-- come on!  How about a happy hour special for the regular diners who don't want to be in the loud cantina crowd?

I wanted to try something different this time, I normally do burritos or beef tacos, but I am trying to eat just a little bit healthier and lose some weight, so I decided to try the Grilled Fish Tacos

I told our waiter what I wanted, and on the menu it says your choice of beans, refried, churro, or black, our waiter didn't even ask, and to be honest I am ok with whatever showed up on my plate. Now the menu description was Two corn tortillas with grilled tilapia, tomatillo mayonnaise, shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, and cilantro. Served with a side of salsa de piña,  that right their got me craving the salsa of pina, which in my white girl head flipped it to pineapple salsa, man doesn't that sound delish and I was so sure that it would go so well with grilled tilapia, like how mango salsa is grilled chickens best friend. But guess what, I couldn't tell you, it never showed up, the one thing I was looking for and it didn't show up, was super bummed. The type beans I wound up were charro, like I said I was easy going on that part. The grilled talapia lacked flavor too, it was sort of bland.

I understand that it was a Sat night and we were a big group and the place was busy, but I had to flag out waiter down to even ask for our checks, he just kept disappearing, and wasn't very attentive, never once asked any of us if our meals were ok, just sort of gave us our plates and left and just ignored our table, so I never even got the chance to ask for the salsa de pina. Saw his tip was already included on the bill since we were a big party, which I expected, but I just don't like when the tip is already added and the server didn't really do anything to earn it, but its part of the going out and eating beast, sometimes service is spot on or better and sometimes we get treated like the red headed step child.  One of my friends even had food fall of the plate down her back when he was picking up our plates and never once did he say sorry.   Wouldn't blame her if she didn't want to go back."	3.0

It use to be a tradition to go to your Peoria location every Sunday night after dinner with my family and friends. We started noticing a pattern of rude service. We usually arrive around 9pm and the restaurant doesn't close til 10. It's like the waiters were annoyed that we were coming in. It has seriously been the last 5 or 6 times we visitied. We got the same 2 people a waiter and waitress and they were consistently rude. So over a period of time we've gone less. We usually decide to give it another chance and we're always disappointed. Tonight was so bad that we walked out before we were even seated. We arrived at 9 the restaurant was practically empty and we stood in the waiting area for 20 minutes waiting. A male waiter(one of the 2 rude ones) walked by where we were standing and looked at us. He walked back by us and said very loudly, ""I don't want any more people, I'm tired."" At that point we decided that's enough. Never have we felt like our business was unwanted. It was completely rude and uncalled for."	1.0

This location needs to be closed and remodeled. 
There are dusty dirty box fans on the ledges all over the restaurant.
Server uniform looked like he had been wearing it every day all week.
He was accommodating, but too busy to visit my table or stay long enough for me to finish a sentence.
The two things that really told me NEVER again was:
1. I chewed on a piece of plastic that was in my chimichanga. I brought it to my servers attention. He had it taken off the bill BUT the manager on duty ""Angela""  didn't even bother to come to my table until I specifically asked for management TWICE! 
Then all she had to say was excuses ""that she didn't come over because the restaurant had too many booths for her to visit"" and she asked what was the problem, that she took the item off my bill.
I HAD MORE THAN ENOUGH MONEY TO PAY FOR MY BILL. 
Not everyone wants a free meal, perhaps I just wanted an attentive management, an apology from management AND perhaps offered an item that did not have plastic in it.
2. I saw a huge roach in the bathroom.
I will not be visiting this location again!

I used to come all the time for happy hour and order off that section of the menu, but the chicken wings have gone down in quality and no longer hold the same taste. The same can be said about the quesadilla and burgers. The $5 burgers should be $5 as they are not of good quality anymore.

When we ordered dessert, I asked if the brownie had nuts, the server said ""I'm not sure, but I know for sure the blonde brownie doesn't"".  I said sure.  It came out with a scoop of ice cream covering the whole thing so I couldn't see that it was filled with huge walnut chunks.  I took one bite, started to react and went to the bar to get water.  As we are trying desperately to get out of there so I can get some benadryl, my dad has to stay behind to pay the bill.  They took off my dessert that I couldn't eat and my mom's dessert.

I really tried to like the place because frankly there's not much to chose from! Sadly, the servers there are always miserable and if anything goes wrong with the food the managers are defensive and are not equip to handle a customer complaint. My husband and I ordered 2 meals to share and after one bite of the wrap my husband said ""omg the tortilla tastes like fish"". I absolutely hate seafood so this smell is very pungent to me. I took one whiff and felt ill. We told the server something wasn't right with it and the manager came over and argued that there's no way that fish could get on the wrap. Unfortunately for him we have both been in the industry for over 17 years. I could see the whole thing play out in my mind.. Cook cuts up fish for a meal and then rolls up our wrap on the same board. So gross. Another day I ordered a salad that was listed to have 2 different fruits, crutons, cheese and dressing. I literally was served a plate of lettuce and cheese with no dressing and she walked away before I could stop laughing to ask where my salad was?? They ended up being out of all fruit and crutons and I paid full price for lettuce and cheese. I have had some good food here so I give 2 stars. My biggest issue is the unfriendly servers.

Tried it out again. I guess we are gluttons for punishment. Again with an unfriendly bartender. Seems the customers are an annoyance to your wait staff. The burger was pretty good actually but then we decided to try the new cheesecake crumbles dessert. We paid our tab while waiting on the dessert and after 15 mins I asked her to box it because we had to leave and she decided she would just bring it out not boxed. We asked for a box to do it ourselves and as I was boxing it there were approximately 6 full size stale as shit graham crackers with a tablespoon of what appeared to be a cheese flavored pudding with a crap ton of nasty raspberry syrup. We threw it right in the trash. My husband and I continue to leave 20% tips for the staff hoping we can brighten a servers day because it must suck to work there."	0.0

Still no responds from the neglectful parents. 2 men from other tables were getting mad and asked for the manager.

I gave him a signal I agreed with him which he pointed out to the manager. Still no response from the manager. The rowdy Yates of children continued their bad behavior. Here's the kicker they ordered pizza, why not go to PPP, this noise level is acceptable there. And not to mention at FW on Wednesday kids eat free. So on Wednesday it would be unreasonable to expect a lower noise level. But on Monday? Bad on the managers part to not compensate for the 15 screaming kids. I had to cover my ears! I won't be back.

About the best that can be said of it is that if you just want to get sloshed at happy hour with your friends while watching sports, it's probably cheap and easy to do so.

The beer selection is pretty poor, and it should be a crime to have Guinness on tap without the bartender knowing how to draw a proper pint. They come out with either 1/2 of head or 7 inches of head. Blech.

The biggest issue I noted is that everything is pretty dirty. They brought us to a table that hadn't been wiped down, and then pulled the trick where they ask you to sit down and then proceed to wipe all the debris off the table, half of which falls in your lap. The seats and other things in the bar are in dire need of a deep cleaning.

I was treated to a buffet of fly infested dessert cakes (no seriously I tried to swat a fly away and it was too busy munching on frosting to even fear the death of my hand swat). We also had some burgers and hot dogs with stale buns. A potato salad that still had freezer burn on it. Ok ill just stop there because you might ask why 2 stars?!? Well as we walk back from my second round of getting my money's worth of buffet ($21), me and my lady noticed people with better fresher food. Turns out the hostess didn't tell us it was buffet or you can order off the menu. The waitress was kind enough after hearing our tragic story to comp one buffet price and my lady got to order nice fresh food off the menu at 20% off. Too bad for me I was full off hardened stale bread, freezer burn ice potatoes, and chocolate cake with a side of fly. :-(	0.0

Great venue-outdoors and indoor seating-very open and airy.
Service-DREADFULLY SLOW.

Look I know people are working hard, but seriously. It's spring break, you know its spring break, YOU KNOW there are going to be completely booked but you still dont have enough servers or waitstaff?

There food is fantastic when you get it. The service is very slow...i mean should it take 15 minutes to get coffee? Even after I walked up to remind them I need coffee, it still took almost another 10 minutes.

Overall, you are somewhat held captive because of the location but service needs to be better.

Sitting outdoors, and location are phenomenal..but I would avoid this place until they figure out how to get their service to step up. I know its tough but do you want to be average and get an average tip or be AWESOME."	3.0

I found this place on the Phoenix's event calendar stating that they offer good mimosa and bloody mary deals on the weekends.  Honestly, I just thought the pictures looked fun and the over-sized Jenga needed to be played.  So, we used our Saturday morning to give this place a go.

When you walk up, it is fairly obvious that this place took over what used to be a lawn and garden center of a store.  Nothing wrong with that - it was funky and eclectic.  The entryway is neat and has fun touristy ""stick-your-face"" in the cutout and look like something else photo props out front.  We decided it was decent enough outside to sit in their porch area under one of the misters.  

The booths are two steps up and fun - but a touch awkward for our shorter waitress considering that the extra foot off the ground for the table didn't exactly extend her reach.  We got our drinks quickly and I order the pick 2 combo while my fiancee ordered the street tacos.  

My pick 2 - gringo rolls and mini tacos (fried mini tacos with shredded beef and avocado salsa) which came with a side of rice / beans - $10.  His meal was the shredded chicken mini tacos with jalapeno salsa (didn't include rice and beans) - $11.  

Gringo Rolls - decent.  Kinda bland.  It was simply mashed black beans and cheese wrapped in a tortilla.  They weren't bad, but weren't amazing.  Mini Tacos were my favorite, but just as the name implies they were definitely tiny and there were only 2 of them on the plate.  Surprisingly the rice and beans were totally bland and without flavor.  Boo.  I'll be honest, I was hungry about 2 hours later. 

The waitress was nice and got us refills and such in a timely manner.  No complaints there.

However, I find the prices here outside of happy hour to be outrageous for a dive bar. $17 for a pitcher? $17 for a fajita plate? No free chips and salsa? Those are almost Vegas strip caliber prices! I mean, if it was gourmet food ala Joyride, it'd be one thing, but it's typical bland Mexican bar food that you can get on every street corner in the Valley. Don't get me wrong, the food wasn't *bad*, but it was nothing special and certainly not for the extortional prices they charge.

I'm fine with an hour wait for food on a Friday night, but tell people it's going to be an hour wait.

I doubt I'll bother going back, it's not worth the aggravation and there are other Rosati's that hopefully have their act together."	4.0

I brought my family and then we ordered a pizza sides and drinks and when we receive the check we were told that they do not except any more certificates. About the food: The pizza is filling but left me a little underwhelmed. I ordered pepperoni sausage deep dish and it just wasn't as good as a lot of the other Chicago pizzas in town. Prices are decent but I would rather spend a couple dollars more somewhere else. Decor is very Chicago cool and the server was nice but not completely on the ball. If you're close by it might be worth dropping-in but I would not suggest driving 30 minutes out of your way like I did."	0.0

He was very apologetic and took it back and said he would be back as quick as he could. It took him roughly an hour and ten minutes to return. Not exactly how I would handle a mistake that is 100% their fault. 

Mind you 1/2 my food was left behind so dinner was split. 

Now on to the pizza, it was ok, I guess.  The thin crust was  good, sauce was heavy and inconsistent, cheese was good. I did not like the spices on top after cooking. Just my personal preference. 

Price was high. $29 (including tip) for 14"" cheese pizza, French fries (they were ok for delivery), and a 2L Coke.

Flavor: Surprisingly not there. There is so much grease that I'm sure that the flavor was grease flavor.
Cheese Pull: It didn't stick to the crust, instead, it all slid off when picking up a slice.
Crust: It acts like a sponge for the grease.
Price: Avg.
Cold Test: DO NOT EAT IT COLD, IT GOT WORSE.
Next day test: Each slice was glued to the box from the grease causing each slice to tear apart.

I inevitably order something gross from the menu with the hope that I might find something that I like. This has never happened in the last 2 years. Here is what I have had most recently: Chicken Caesar salad, Thai salad, Asian chicken salad, chicken soup, squash soup, and a chicken sandwich. My resounding feedback on all these items? Yuck. The chicken is poor quality and fatty, they use cheap iceberg lettuce on the salads which has almost zero nutritional value, the soups are bland/taste gross, and I didn't like any of it. I always throw away about half of my meal after picking out the majority of the fatty chicken. I feel sad because I am wasting food and my money. The small bread loaf that comes with the salads is pretty good. Hello carbs! Even the ice tea (all of them) taste weird. I know this because I tried them all searching for one I liked. They were weak and had a weird, chemical taste to them. I do agree with my daughter that the Mac n cheese is good, that's about it. Not 5 star good, more like good for a kid who doesn't eat any fancy food. It's not healthy either. I see grown adults in line at Panera and Paradise Bakery and truly don't get it.

We ordered 2 pick 2 meals and a cookie. We used the order kiosk. While waiting for our food we noticed the food was getting backed up because the person delivering food seemed confused and was moving very slow. I saw our order so I got up from our table and retrieved it. The cookie was missing so I asked for it. I was then told by a not so friendly worker they were out of the type of cookie we ordered and that I should pick a new kind. Then when I got to the table I noticed my sandwich was wrong. I ordered the vegetarian sandwich with no tomatoes, no lettuce and add spinach. I noticed it had lettuce so I brought it back and they informed me they were out of spinach and that's why it had lettuce. So I go back to my table and that's when I realized it was KALE not lettuce. I was so frustrated at this point that I brought it back and spoke to who I thought was a manager and shared my frustrations. She said she needed my card to give me a refund so I said I was going to eat my soup and then I would bring it to her. I went and sat down with my mom and as I put my spoon in my mouth Angel ran over saying ""I need your card"". I literally can't find the words to express how rude and inappropriate it was for her to do that. I told her I was going to finish my soup and then I would come get her. When I was done I went to get her and she couldn't be found so the actual manager helped me. I didn't feel like she really even cared or truly felt bad about my horrible experience. I will never return to this location. I honestly wish it was still paradise bakery.

Walking in the door: the flow of the restaurant is very congested. You have to struggle past the people ""avoiding the line"" by using kiosks just to get to the line. Then, after you place your order, you have to squeeze past them again to the beverage station. It's just a stupid design. 

The food:  I ordered a sandwich, which I have no complaints about, and when asked what side I wanted, I chose apples instead of chips. When my sandwich came, I was surprised and appalled to see an entire un-sliced apple on my plate next to my sandwich. Not only is this poor plate presentation, it just seems lazy.

She then told the girl next to her to change her sign as well, as breakfast was over. I ignored it and went to go pick up my order and I asked the other girl giving me my bagel what time is breakfast stop serving at? And she said we stopped at 10:30.

This is honestly my first time ever eating at a Panera Bread. This location used to be a Paradise Bakery and then recently changed this year I believe. So I thought I'd give it a try today.

I visited about 4:15p and it wasn't busy at all. A few people sitting and eating and a family not sure what they wanted to order. I went up to the cashier and inquired about what was on a particular sandwich and she seemed bothered that I asked her and didn't even know what was on it until she looked it up. She didn't seem like she wanted to be there, and it was a rather poor customer service experience. I don't really care that much about customer service as long as they're not being rude to me. So I ordered a half sandwich of Turkey-Apple-Cheddar and a cup of soup. I don't try to make my order complicated or ask for anything special about it. I ordered it exactly as it comes.

I was the ONLY person on the order preparation screen and my order came up rather quickly, which I thought was nice. I grabbed my order and and took it home. However, once I finally opened the bag and looked inside, I saw a rather pathetic looking half sandwich. Which honestly I think was over priced. I think it was almost $7 just for a half sandwich. Anyway, that didn't bother me too much as long as the food was good.

Well, it was mediocre tasting when I started eating it, but then I noticed something just wasn't right about it. No turkey! How do you forgot the most crucial and expensive part of the sandwich?!

I could maybe understand if I had tried to customize my sandwich in some way OR if maybe they were busy making other orders and mixed mine up. This was not the case though. This was a very poor experience with Panera Bread for me. Some of you out there may like Panera Bread, I personally prefer Wildflower, but do not visit this location if you do. This will be my first AND last time at a Panera Bread.

As we are putting in our order, about 7 other people walk in.  About 3 minutes later an employee comes to the counter and says ""I can help the next person in line""...REALLY??

Compared to those, this service is really not good.  The portions are small and the last meal I just ate seemed like something from my high school cafeteria.  Like the mystery meat we all have experienced.  And, like others, I did not realize I needed to cancel/skip my next delivery until it was too late.  I received my first order on a Saturday and as of Sunday night they had charged me again for the next week and also giving me the same meals.  I didn't even get a chance to try them.  I would not have ordered the second week's worth.  The only reason I give them 2 stars is because the chili was actually quite delicious.  The rest, bland and meh. Stouffers lasagna is better.

Prior to us leaving I put my weekly orders on hold.  They did not ship the food but they still charged my bank account.  I called customer service and was given one excuse after another. First they told me that I didn't put a hold on my deliveries.  I did.... and I printed it out so that I would have proof.  They even charged my bank account the $59.99 twice in one day. Then they told me they already credited the charges to me - they did not.  So how does that happen when the orders were put on hold?  Still waiting for a credit back to my bank account for their error.  I would NOT use their service again - not because the food was not good - only because of how they handled this situation.	0.0

The food is marketed as being healthy fresh eating. There is nothing healthy about it. some of the items have over 700 calories. The food sounds like it should be delicious but everything has MASSIVE amounts of pepper on it. I don't know if it's because the food is lacking flavor or something and they decided that massive amounts of pepper was a good idea, but there is WAY to much pepper on every dish i had. i could go into the details of how some of the dishes resemble baby food, but will leave it with this....if you want to eat the same type of food. buy a 99 cent frozen meal, pour a bunch of pepper on it and boom...pretty much the same thing.	4.0
5747	2aVQu4wnptrFM_kxDhhPIg	1.0	1.0	1.0	"Disclaimer: my family and I are recreational eaters, so we've tried just about everything on earth.  We ordered a 6-meal pack with the following to get a taste of the full spectrum of dish types:
--Peppercorn Steak
--Chicken Parmesan
--Sausage & Green Chile Frittata
--Quinoa Porridge
--Chicken with Asparagus Risotto
--Paleo Beef Chili

PROS:
--Beautiful website that's easy to manage without help
--Convenient and reliable shipping
--Stupid-proof reheating instructions
--Nice packaging/labeling

CONS:
--Of that list the only one we actually enjoyed was the sausage and green chile frittata.  Every other dish ranged from disgusting to mediocre.
--There is so much packing material.  Even though it's recyclable I can't help but feel it's a huge waste of money that could be put towards making the food better.
--Spices were nowhere near balanced.  
   *For the love of Pete, add some salt to these recipes
   *The paleo chili is so thick and over-spiced you could have cut it in half with water and it would still have been a pretty powerful stew.  
   *The other dishes just had no flavor whatsoever.
--Everything was way overcooked.
   *Chicken grill marks had an excessively burnt/carbon taste that destroyed the whole dish
   *All the chicken dishes were dry/stringy
   *All the proteins were huge slabs and were a pain to cut while in the tray
   *Every rice and pasta dish was just a hair away from turning into mush
   *Vegetables were flavorless and overcooked/mushy

VERDICT: 
Don't be fooled by the gorgeous packaging and website.  The food (which is really the only thing that matters in the end) is unacceptable and is not worth the wait or expense.  I'd rather double up on LeanCuisines at my local grocer, it would taste better and be cheaper and I get gas points.  Sorry Freshly :("	6.0

Placing an order was easy. Went online, placed the order on a Monday for Saturday delivery. FedEx shipping info was sent by email. Food started its journey to me on Thursday and delivered by end of day on Saturday as promised. 

Items were well packaged and remained cold but not frozen. Portions appeared substantial. I'm hopeful about the taste. Since this is a subscription service, I can't imagine having to send so much styrofoam, plastic bag and ice packs to landfills every week if I continued the service.

They got the order wrong and 3 of the 6 fish dishes were inedible. Fish smelled so bad we ended up throwing them away. The other 3 were bland and like any frozen food you can get at a supermarket, at 4x the cost.

Within 24 hours of receiving the first shipment, before I even had a chance to taste the food, I was charged $62 for the second shipment. They were also supposed to send an email notifying me of upcoming charges but I never received it. Immediately went online to cancel my subscription and contacted the company. 

Told the rep how bad the food was, not receiving an email notification of the charge, and that I do not want to continue the service. The rep rudely said ""you do realize we are a subscription based company"" and that they will not refund the 2nd shipment because I 'should've' received an email. I asked to speak to a manager to which she said ""fine, but the manager is not going to refund your money either."" After a 10 minute hold for the manager, she came back and said they're having internet problems so she is not able to transfer the call. Could this be why I never received the email from them??? If the manager ever calls back and doesn't correct the situation, I will be disputing the charge with my cc company.

Update:

1 1/2 day later - received a call from a supervisor. She actually stated that she also did not receive email notification of charges from the company when she first signed up for subscription... but that the problem had been resolved... obviously not. Bottom line, she refused any refund. Spoke to Toby, cust svc manager who was rude and arrogant. He also said he is not going to do anything about the problem... he's not going to issue a refund and that's that.... and that there's no one above him that I would be able to speak to.

After a few times eating the same meals, you just get kind of tired of it and at over $10/meal, you just would rather go eat at a fast food joint. Here are the meals I tried and my scores:

Grilled Flat Iron Steak: 4- tender and juicy, steak is somewhat slim but it was enough for me. 

Baked Penne Marinara: 3 - a little bland, but a generous portion. 

Chimichurri Salmon: 2.5 - to me, there's something wrong with eating a precooked salmon and microwaving it later. It's dry and doesn't taste fresh. 

Grilled herb chicken: 1 - I do not recommend. It was bland, boring and I threw most of it away. 

Garlic & Herb Shrimp: 2 - the shrimp is really small and the flavor wasn't that great. It looks better than it tastes.

Peruvian style stuffed peppers: 2 - I wasn't a big fan of this one either. I didn't like the taste and I only ate half of one pepper. The package comes with 2. 

Sweet & Spicy chicken: 3 - the flavor wasn't bad but the chicken was small!

Rather than rescheduling your delivery date, they opt to just cancel your delivery for holiday weeks like July 4th and Thanksgiving, etc. I would certainly look elsewhere is weekly meals are a necessity for you. Sure, they give you advanced notice which necessitates that you log onto their website for said notification -  God forbid that you be too busy to stay in constant contact.

With a name like ""Freshly"" you get the image in your head of freshly made meals delivered right to your door.  However, these are still frozen dinners that you have to microwave, which is not my idea of fresh food.  Some of the meals are great, but not all.  After only 2 weeks, I realized this was just not for me and that I'd much prefer truly fresh (and not frozen) meals that were cooked (and not microwaved).  

If you live a busy lifestyle with no time to make your own food, this might be a great option for you.  Or, you can go to the grocery store and buy (almost) the same frozen dinners at half the cost.  Otherwise, you can simply cook your own food to assure it's healthy, fresh, and delicious."	11.0

A company should be able to move faster than that. I then loved the meal arrival - simple packaging. Gel cold packs are a bit bulky and wasteful, but the rest is streamlined. My first salmon meal was okay -- because you have to reheat it, the salmon gets overcooked. The peppers meal was also okay but made me question if I would like the rest. Next meal of pecan pork was awful - weird texture to the pork; definitely not high quality meat. Final meal of herb chicken was very good. After the pork I canceled my service. I couldn't tell if it canceled the next week's delivery but assumed it did since not message came up saying it didn't. But they sent another set of meals, saying I had to cancel by 5 pm on Thursday - the day after I received my first shipment on Weds afternoon. Ridiculous. They could have easily canceled my service (I canceled on Friday for meals that wouldn't even be packed or shipped before Monday).

My first mistake: Dont assume that something called 'Freshly' is local. 
I didnt know they were going to cook it Wednesday, ship it on Thursday from Phx to SF to arrive on Saturday, to be eaten over the next 6 days. 'FRESH'? 
  My other mistake is having a busy week and 'missing' the warning email... I still can't find it, but it was supposed to give me the option of skipping a week. I thought the promo offer would allow me to try the food first, before I had to take measures to keep them from charging me for more. I was wrong again. 
  They refused to cancel or refund the second order. I have to pay $60 for 6 more wk-old airline meals to arrive next Saturday. I feel a little taken advantage of, scammed. I really wanted to try their food with a little time to decide if it was for me. A weeks worth of meals should be allowed to be eaten over the course of a week before a new charge applied. 
  
Support said ""While I certainly understand your frustration, please understand that we prepare your food from fresh ingredients and take the time to cook them properly and with care. Our meals are perishable and require a strict production schedule that, if deviated from whenever someone wishes, would damage the integrity of the meals. This is why it is so critical to give ample time for changes or cancellations"".

 Today is Monday, my meals are scheduled to ship Thursday. I suggested there was plenty of time to cancel and credit my card. They could keep their meals and have a satisfied customer. Satisfied customers are apparently not their priority. Had they cancelled, and refunded as I requested I might have better enjoyed the meals remaining in my fridge, and re-ordered at a later date. Now I have a sour taste in my mouth to go with the bland food. 
 
 I'm eating the Chicken Caponata while I write this so you can get a 'fresh' review. The broccoli has good texture, a hint of garlic flake (which looks a bit odd, like a hint of grated cheese), but is bland. The chicken is tender, not dry, the toasted almond coating is there, not sure it adds anything. The eggplant Caponata with raisins and capers is ok, but lacks a flavor punch that one would expect. I think all the flavors have melded and mellowed in shipping. I added salt to enhance the flavors and it did, quite well. However, at 640gm of sodium it's already on the high side and shouldn't need more.
  Last night I had the Pecan pork, the pork also was tender, not dry, but the 'gravy' and pecan coating were insufficient and flavorless. The only real flavor in the meal was the raisins and cranberries with the green beans. 
 I don't have a 'refined' palate. I consider myself an average American. Though I live in a city with many excellent restaurants I eat and enjoy most everything, from street vendor fare to occasional 5star dining. 
 This experience left me disappointed with the food and the customer service.

Competitors at the same price range in my area are of such a better quality that it would be silly to compare. That there are reviews claiming their food is 'delicious' seems highly suspect to me, but I suppose taste is subjective. 

Further, you will be given precisely one day to cancel your subscription after delivery. Freshly will not offer you a confirmation code to keep for your records. When I was concerned that something was amiss with my cancelation (they sent an email asking if I wanted to adjust my meals), I was told there was no record I had stopped the service and that I should be pleased that they could cancel the next.

2) I am a recycling advocate but the recycling process for this packaging was the biggest pain in my arse. 

3) Customer Service thumbs down. Missed the skip deadline by just a few hours, wrote them right away (same day of deadline) and they told me they couldn't help me. Right! Somehow I doubt they were cooking my meals between when I wrote them and when they responded. It's clear my food hadn't been prepared yet or shipped. Money-grubbing. No sense of accommodation. Cancelled immediately afterward.

Would not recommend this service.

More importantly, their subscription system sucks. I skipped the second week since we had only just received the food and then I was out of town camping the next weekend and got back just after the 5pm Sunday deadline. I was already charged for the next week and while I could still change the meals for another day, they refused to cancel the week's shipment because I missed the deadline by one hour. They claimed it was because the food was already purchased but then how is it I could still change meals? They even told me they sent two emails saying the deadline was Saturday when they really sent one saying it was Sunday. And you can't completely cancel your subscription, only pause it!
It's the same system as loot crate or a food coop, except with either of those, if you miss the deadline, you're only out $50/month rather than $100/week. Plus, you get a lot more from those services than this one."	0.0

As a customer care professional, I was shocked at the response to my customer support inquiry after my first delivery. I had only tasted one meal after about 48 hours and was notified that I was already 5 hours too late in editing my meal options or pausing my delivery for my second week's delivery.

I was charged for a full second week, was not offered to reschedule and was flat out denied a any refund for something that I have not even received and isn't even close to being shipped out. So disappointing, especially at a time when I still paid to try them out while other competitors are offering free trials with much better customer support and follow-up.

Needless to say, this experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I wouldn't recommend Freshly, and it's unfortunate that I was not allowed ample time to really evaluate the product before being charged a second time.

I will repeat the following tip (previously mentioned by another reviewer):
""TIP: After placing your first order, immediately put a hold on all additional weeks until you try and decide if you want to continue. Freshly one requires NINETY-SIX hours (four whole days) notice in order to change or cancel any service, which is barely enough time to even eat what they ship before another one is on it's way."""	14.0

Definitely healthier and fresher than other frozen meals. As far as meals itself, they leave a lot to be desired considering the portion size (not adjustable) and cost. 

Was looking at alternatives to cooking for weeks when I'm too busy and don't really want to eat at a restaurant and came across Freshly and managed to get a $30 for 6 meals coupon so figured it's worth it to at least try. Looking at the meals, I did see that they were microwaveable. Though I'm not the greatest fan of microwaved meals, I did want to give them the benefit of doubt and try out the meals.

Ordering: Very simple and straight-forward. Enter your zip so that you know you can receive it, choose how many meals in a week (6-21), the delivery date, and the meals you want. Looking at the menu compared to the order sheet, the only complaint is that the sizes were different than what I received. Looking at the menu on the week I had my food, it did match so there might be some difference there.

Delivery: Had it delivered to my building and while the box was big, they claim everything is recyclable. Food was chilled properly and packaged neatly so no issues there.

Presentation: Meals were in their own containers and protein and veggies are separated. Only issue was the wrappers were difficult to get off. This has been stated in many reviews and there is supposedly a fix coming. 

Food itself: I ordered 6 meals as follows:
- Asian-Style Steak With Vegetable Stir-Fry - 3/5
- Beef Provencal With Polenta and Roasted Vegetables - 4/5
- Chicken Milanese With Braised Green Beans  - 2/5
- Chimichurri Salmon With Succotash - 3/5
- Roasted Turkey With Apple, Almond Butter Gravy - 2/5
- Garlic & Herb Shrimp - soul crushingly horribly/5

Overall, the food was really lacking to me. Sauces had separated partially so there was a colored liquid and colored textured portions separated. Having the sauces in separate packets would help this. While most of the meals tasted decent and did taste fresh, the vegetables were not too happy to be microwaved and most of the protein portions were underflavored. Being healthy doesn't mean you can't have flavorful meat. 

I did want to call out two meals to show the difference between them.
Beef Provencal - Great meal overall with some small callouts. The vegetables were in no way roasted and boiled instead. Whoever thought it was a good idea to boil brussels sprouts should be force fed them. Roasting them greatly improves the flavor, or at least does for me. The Polenta tasted fantastic but had an almost chunky and separated texture, especially once mixed with the remaining sauce from the beef.

Garlic & Herb Shrimp - Honestly, tasted like something repackaged from Lean Cuisine style meals. Vegetables were mushy, shrimps had no seasoning and were very rubbery/chewy, and the whole meal lacked flavor that was anything but depressing. 

For $30 for 6 meals, it would be worth the service. Good variety and decent flavor for most meals and definitely a step up from other microwaveable meals. For $70, way too overpriced in my mind, especially for such small sized portions. I know it's not the target audience but you can make these meals for the same if not lower price, adjust it to your liking, and actually have a fresh cooked meal. For now, canceling the service and going back to home cooked meals.

For consumers, if you're used to microwaveable meals or need something that's quick and easy, it's worth a look to see if it's something you like.
For Freshly, giving the option to cook the meals and separate the sauces, it will definitely improve the service."	7.0

Tried the pork sausage with pasta and peppers. It looked impressive but was very bland and the sausage dry. Like I've never had such a dry sausage.

Food: Overall just plain bad. I really was looking forward to this service because I'm disabled, not suppose to cook (on oxygen) but a brief synopsis of what I have tried:
Turkey with quinoa: thin stringy slices (2) of turkey on top of quinoa dressing. I like quinoa, but this had an unusual aftertaste...not pleasant. Flat ugly meal, not at all appetizing.
Peppercorn steak: Nuked great, but suppose to stir potatoes halfway. Problem: steak on top of potatoes...have to pick up steak, stir potatoes and scoot them to one side. No separate compartment. I was really happy with steak (about medium) until I got to thicker center...too chewy and texture like tough liver. Carrots/green beans too tough/rubbery to eat.
Shrimp scampi: WT*? Lots of water?wine? no taste, small shrimp and small almost pearl rice.
Tried garlic and butter, but it was past saving. What's with all the watery liquid? Should have said to peel back or not used so much liquid. 
I have 1 more steak dinner and a chicken masala? left from second order. Frankly, to be blunt I wish I'd thrown those out and kept my food. I'm not even tempted to try the chicken, but I will give steak one more chance because I threw out good food for these little entrée boxes.
Biggest disappointment. Way overpriced for amount of product or quality.
Customer service was good...initially he credited me with 2 both weeks, but then charged me for one of the weeks. 
Pro: One meal was the breakfast of scrambled eggs, sausage. It was good, but c'mon, can't throw us a biscuit in there? I didn't want to cook a whole can of them! 

I know this is a harsh review. But I've tried Blue Apron, Marley & Co. Hello Fresh and even Plated, which I gave most all away because my lack of desire to cook.

I recommend if you sign up, immediately pause or cancel since you won't have enough time to decide if you like the groceries. The vegis are okay, but all the meat and fish products we have had are tasteless or taste bad or are tough or chewy (in a bad way). Trader Joe's frozen meals, if you pick the right ones, are a better deal. I would recommend to freshly that meal number 2 be two weeks after meal number one and weekly thereafter.

The second time, I only went back because, again, we were at the park and my kids were really hungry. I quickly bought a groupon because I didn't want to pay full price for not very good food. We ordered 2 slices of pizza with a drink, the chopped salad, the hot dog kids meal, and the Italian beef sandwich. The total would have been $31 without the groupon. It took us 25 minutes to get our food. Then the woman tells me she made sure they put my au jus on the side for my sandwich. I reminded her that we also ordered pizza, as she had not given it to me in my order, and she added it. Seriously, she totally forgot the pizza. 

Then we get to the park, and I find that the au jus she so kindly had them put on the side was non-existent. The sandwich was not good. My daughter threw the other half for me in the desert for the critters to eat up. Maybe it would have been better with the elusive au jus.

My little girl's kids meal, which contained a small hot dog, some fries, and a tiny fountain drink was $5.99. Rip off.

The salad was okay, but the ranch they serve there is soybean oil based, and I hate soybean oil based ranch dressing. Is it really that hard to mix it yourself at your restaurant? Most restaurants do now. Also, they gave us one fork for three people, so we had to take turns with it. Why even bother putting one fork in? I guess they figured only one person was going to be eating the salad, but still.

Again, the pizza was meh, and my daughter only ate one slice. The other slice was for the critters and birds.

Rosati, you should get yourself together. I won't eat here again even with a groupon. It's not even worth the discounted price."	4.0

My wife's food came out first, then mine came out about 15 minuets after but I ordered a full slab of ribs so I guess that's ok but what really made me mad was me son ordered a 10 inch pizza and that did not come out till a additional 15 minuets after my ribs. So my son had to wait over a hour to get his 10 inch pizza. And I had asked several times where his pizza was and I was told that it's coming out soon. I we will never be back to this location. It's also cramped and tiny inside. And it's not a place for a younger crowd it was full of old people. If your over 60 then this place is for you.	0.0

We were greeted right away, but drinks took literally 12 minutes before they arrived and we were the only table in the whole restaurant. When I did make eye contact with a waitress, she must have felt bad and realized she'd forgotten us, and said she had to go in the back to get some drinks. Then they came out right away.
The pizza took as long as we expected it to, probably about 25 minutes, but once it did arrive she never checked to make sure we had everything we needed or that it was okay. At the end of the meal, I had to ask a different waitress for a box and our check.

5816	PmkXtqIcjQGpNShB8yTSrA	0.0	0.0	2.0	The food is fairly decent here, and it's pretty much the only restaurant within 5 miles of its location.  Their grinders and sandwiches are good, the salads are not so great, and the pizza is average/above average.  The reason this place doesn't get another star is the price.  You may do a double take when you see how much they charge for what you get. $10 for a tiny side salad you can get for a buck at Wendys.  Pizzas are $25+ (for a large), and 6 inch sandwiches are roughly 10 bucks.  I know the rent in this area is high, so maybe it's not the fault of the restaurant that they charge so much, but as a value-driven consumer, I find it really hard to bite the bullet and eat here.	3.0

Last night ordered a pizza, salad and garlic bread was part of the deal. We had 3 toppings, 2 of which were vegetables.The total cost was $35...with a coupon. The pizza crust was terrible. The consistency of crackers or cardboard with same terrible taste. Garlic bread was stale. Salad was ok but my menu showed $7.99 and I was charged $9.99. With the increase of residences being built in this area, this place needs to get it together and deliver quality food. They haven't done it in years.

The service is even worse. The kids that work here stand around and talk to each other and ignore customers. They have little or no training and absolutely no people skills. Scary to think what the employees could make in tips and how much more money the place could make if they actually cared a little bit. I guess their monopoly on rio verde makes them enough money that customer service really doesn't matter. This is probably the 4th or 5th bad experience I have had at this location.

We have come in here when there are literally 2 people in the whole place, and the quickest we ever got our pizza was 1 1/2 hours. Really? Pizzas don't cook that long, and we order the thin crust, not deep dish. I think they take care of the carry-outs first but really, an hour and a half? We even waited over two hours one time. Even with a Groupon this pizza is way over priced. And it isn't even that good. The only reason that I got the Groupons is that we purchased a carry-out pizza years ago and recalled it being decent.

This was not! Over 40 years this was the worst one ever. Freezer burned buns that had section in them like tare a part dinner rolls. The a juice taste like they knocked the salt over in it, god awful.  This past Monday night I ordered a pizza from them on line. I arrive to pick up my pie but the young man behind the bar has no clue where my order or pie is. So this short balled guy with an goatee and looks like he cooks for the local prison comes around the bar and picks up the fax right on top of the cash drawer and tells the kid "" you have to bring these in the back"" The kid walks away from me and says nothing. Pretty clear they forgot my order? AH yes. The kid is trying to avoid me hard, so the girl comes out of the kitchen and I ask for my pie, she checks and says ""it will be 5 minutes"" meanwhile the kid is trying to sweep but he cant get the hang of it so the girl shows him how. 

Now after the 5 minutes has passed I ask the girl what happen to my order, she blames the online order proses, the fax machine jammed and it cam in late. The she puts the fax down in front of me. Little does she know that fax have time and date stapes on them.......lol The got the order at 7:56 and I arrived at 8:25, I didn't leave until 8:42.

Thinking I got my pie and shit happens, I head down Dynamite to home. Sit down and un pause the ball game and enjoy my pizza. Oh no, the pizza is dam near raw,,,,.............needles to say I am pretty angry at this point. So a call to the pizza place and a just a minute let me get the manager, who must of shown up in the 7 minutes it took me to get home. So they give me a credit .....or lol so she says....

Extra large customized pizza - So soggy and greasy that you couldn't feel the difference between the cheese and the crust. It was slop and just fell apart through your fingers when picking it up. 

Mild chicken wings - I've never seen wings like this. They were grayish/black inside and tasted rotten (the meat looked like the inside fat of a salmon). It was so tough, it was like gnawing on beef jerky. We spit out the first bites and threw everything in the trash. 

Jalapeno poppers - So greasy that by just picking one up in your fingers, grease would stream out all over your shirt. 

'Breaded' mushrooms - the breading was not fully cooked. It was more like 1/2 fried dough mushrooms. 

Cannoli's (we were hoping we could at least enjoy these) - the filling tasted like tubed frosting you would get in the discount baking isle at the grocery store. Just 'buttery sugar'.

They were late (1-1/2 hours - I live .69 of a mile away. 

We ordered 6 liters of Dr. Pepper and got 1 liter of Dr. Pepper and 5 liters of Coke. 

The delivery boy actually asked for the tip before he even set the food down on the counter. He said; ""it says you're going to tip in cash, right?""

We went for dinner last night because we felt that we could have a nice Xmas Eve dinner here.  Well, it was OK, but far from what I wanted or expected.  Let me begin by telling you that they have been advertising that they have a new chef with a new menu that is great!  NOT!!

I call to make reservations for dinner and ask if Annabelle's Restaurant is open for dinner since the last time I went, I called and was told ""yes"" but in fact the restaurant was closed and we had to eat in the coffee shop.  I was again told yes.  I also ask if the menu is the same as what is showing on the website and I am told yes.

We get there and order a couple of cocktails and start to peruse the menu.  First thing I notice is that there are no appetizers on the menu except for shrimp cocktail.  WTF?  Are you kidding me?  What kind of semi-fine dining restaurant has no appetizers?  And the rest of the menu bears no resemblance to what is shown of their website.  WTF?  So I ask if we can order from both the coffee shop menu as well as the restaurant's menu and they tell me yes.  That is a relief since I ordered some onion rings with some smoked chipolte dipping sauce and some nachos with chicken -- both appetizers are pretty good.

There are four of us and we order as our dinners chicken ala king over angel hair pasta, chicken marsala, shrimp scampi, and a NY cut steak.  The dinners are MEH at best and they have no french fries or baked potato for my steak.  They do have mashed potatoes, but I am not a mashed potatoes fan.

Salad of mixed greens and Caesar salad are fine.  

But the dessert menu is pathetic and only one of us orders dessert -- a chocolate lava cake that looks like a Mac truck ran over a chocolate cupcake and they scrapped it of the road.

The bill is $150 for four of us --- not expensive, but not cheap either.  But I think I can do better at another restaurant.

But this was just nuts. 
Brought my whole family here tonight for my parent's anniversary dinner, 7 adults and 3 kids. I happen to work across the street from this restaurant and thought it would be good to give it a try. And it was rated so well on Yelp!!
We get here and are seated quickly thanks to our reservation.
We get waters from the nice bussers, but it ends up being about 20 minutes before someone comes around to take any drink order. Red flag numero uno. 
From then on, it's just one catastrophic circumstance after another. 
*Apparently, as we were informed later on in the night, they only had ONE chef, although they had taken at least 4 reservations that we could see for parties of 10+. 
*Also, there was no manager on duty. At all. On a weekend night, no less. 
*Our server was brand new. She was very nice, and apologetic for the disaster that was our dining experience. Which we let her know was none of her fault. How the management thought it a good idea to throw a brand new server on for large parties with no help is beyond me. 
*They were basically out of everything. If you google the menu, you will notice there is not an extensive list of options. Great, fine with us. But when four different people at our table are told that the selections they've made are out tonight (including my son's pick of MAC & CHEESE), then that's just unacceptable and further illustration of the poor management. 
Due to all of these events and the unimaginable wait time between any kind of event (30-40 minutes between ordering and receiving anything, including drinks), we were pretty irritated by the end of our meal. 
Added to that stress, the elderly table of 6 next to us was at the tale end of their similar experience, which lead them to complain quite loudly and argue at the table with a rather rude brunette server who was acting as a manager type and hearing them vent. After which, they started to ask our table if we were satisfied and having as bad a night as them. Ugh. 
I will say that at the end of our meal, after my little brother (who has been a bartender for 6 years and was FUMING) tracked down a bartender named Ruben, we were finally given an explanation (ill managed and unprepared) and apology, and were taken care of for out trouble. Ruben was very nice, and had great customer service skills. And although we were nice and smiled through the whole ordeal, I felt bad that he had to face the brunt of all the angry patrons that night, which from my count, was everyone in the restaurant. He's the reason there is an extra star in this review. 
Ugh. On advice per Ruben, I may try and muster up the gall to give this place another chance, provided on a different day and only with the server he suggested.

There were still people behind me!! But she did come back to tell me she didn't need my name because the black lady who was running expo knew it was my order. 
I stood there for 10 minutes waiting for my snake bite hot dog, trying to get the black lady's attention that my hot dog has been ready , sitting there, she just RANDOMLY walks out too!!!  Wow! I was so fed up after waiting 15 minutes for a freaking hot dog I  went to a different register and ask the lady if she could just give me my damn hot dog. She asked me for my name, of course, and I had to explain to her the blonde old lady told me I didn't need it because the black lady knew it'd be mine but BOTH of them were GONE! She gave me my hot dog and apologized and I told her it's not her fault and she's the only decent person that worked there.

As were standing in line at the register there's an employee in front of us ordering a large order for a birthday party she is hosting for. We wait patiently and as she finishes up another employee cuts in front of us (and now the line forming behind us) and begins placing another large order! 

So I said something about how we've been waiting and now they finally tell me, oh this register is only for employees to put in party orders! Really!! You couldn't have said that before! How am I supposed to know that, there was no sign saying that! 

So I change registers and wait in line again and order a large pizza tokens and a drink. We get delivered a medium pizza and are in the process of eating it and commenting on how small the large pizza is when an employee walks by with a larger pizza. I ask her what size that is and she says large!

So I take half of the medium pizza back up to the counter with my receipt and they confirm they did make me a medium not a large. They said they'd make us a new one. 

So as the birthday party is wrapping up our large pizza arrives (2 hrs after we initially ordered) and the pizza is over cooked. Fantastic. We choke down a few bites and take the rest to go. 

There was one positive, the kids seemed to have fun playing the games, however the whole experience was ruined because everyone was hungry the whole time.

Cool that all the games are one token however many will eat your money so it balances out. Prizes are absolute crap as usual, the real hunt is finding an employee to help you. Oh, and the Chuck E Cheese show was restarted not once but TWICE. They let all the kids stand up there excited and the tv is blaring his count down to 1 and nothing happens. No one comes out.

Food is over priced compared to what you can get for the same price at Peter Piper. Pizza tastes like Little Caesar's deep dish which is only $8. Very subpar. Tables remained dirty for a long time. The Kay out of tables and games was kind of confusing and not very thought out. A lot of games were out of order and  there were barely any games that you could win a good amount of tickets from, most give you two or three. When Chucky came out he ignored my kids trying to hug and high five him and he just kept dancing instead.

The other people had to clean up their party instantly with no time, while we stood their waiting awkwardly for them. Then it took forever for them too have our party decorated and set up for while our guests were waiting. It took them forever to bring out our token for the kids, and an hour for the pizza to come after we found out it wasn't even ordered, even though it was ordered online with the party. Everyone acted like they didn't know what was going on and every time we asked to speak to a manager a different manager came out.

Our host, who will remain nameless, was a total space cadet.  She brought one thing out at a time.  Table cloths 10 mins later plates, 10 mins later veggie tray, 10 mins later forks, our pizza order didn't arrive until after an hour of our 2 hour reservation, then more cups trickled in and finally one hour and 45 mins later she brought the basket which contain all the silverware and napkins.  This is after we spoke to the manager.  We did manage to get the attention of another host who was busy but very kind and accommodating and she was extremely helpful, Hannah was her name.  She should be promoted and provide training to the rest of the staff. 

The Pros:  1. Kids didn't know the trouble we were having with the service because they were too busy playing. 2.  Coincidently we were ready to sign Happy Birthday along with the Televised Chuck E Cheese so it appeared that the entire place was signing to my grandson which made him feel extremely special.  3.  The nameless host did manage to get Chuck E. Cheese himself over to our table to pose for a picture with our birthday boy.

Ordered their sample platter and asked the wings to be prepared without sauce (naked style) and fried twice to ensure extra crispiness. They gladly took our order and we waited while the kids played in their playground. Ordered at 12:45pm and the order was ready at 2pm. Not kidding! We were all famished so didn't care it took so long so started scarfing down the food. We took a bit of a wing and was immediately GROSSED out by it... It was RAW! How could this be? They were preparing it for over an HR and it still turned out RAW? And a chicken dish no less! 
We obviously returned it and the explanation we received was that it's because they had to double fry it to ensure crispiness that's why it took so long. oK, fine, I can appreciate the candor and perhaps next time, tell the customer that it may take over an hour to prepare some wings Bc of the extra frying. However, I am not a professional chef or anything but if you fry chicken wings twice and for over an HR it shouldn't be raw still, right? 

The manager was nice enough to refund our money but I feel inclined to write this review Bc while I was waiting for our order the customer next to us was complaining about how his order took 45 mins to cook (a medium pizza no less) AND how they even got the order wrong! That is so nuts! 

We love Chuck e cheese and I, personally, grew up enjoying such fun and delicious establishment. But this is a family place and I would like to remind them that to shouldn't take that long to prepare an order (simple order) and he food should be fully cooked. No excuses!

They opened about 2 minutes late and then when we get in they didn't have our table setup. 2 other parties where there who had theirs.

Then they come out and tell us the oven is not working so we may not get pizza! Ok crap happens and I get it but they offered no solution. No real manger was in so no one can tell me any alternative or if I would get a discount. By the time the manger got in and came to see me one of the other parties gave up and left. I was about to cancel the pizza because of how late it already was (11:25) and are party ended in just over 30 mins. 

They ended up comping 50% of my bill and giving us some free tokens and a pass to come back for dinner and drinks plus more tokens another night. I feel they made up for it but it should have been handled sooner and better. The problem with the oven was the gas was messed up and the gas company had to come out and fix it.

The employee told us we were not allowed to do this and that it would be a violation of the contract.  What a joke, a violation of their contract??? They breached first! (but try explaining that to a bunch of teenagers, who have no understanding of a contract.  BTW, it is all kids running this place.  I didn't see 1 person over the age of 21 there working until after 11:00 am). Because C.C. would not accommodate our party, the host decided to move the entire party to Spinatos, where they were more than happy to accommodate us.

In my opinion, I think it is very sad and disappointing.  Chuck E. Cheese markets directly to kids, but then won't put the kids before their own profits.  I believe a better course would have been for them to have allowed the outside food, and kept the kids and parents at their location.  I know for a fact they lost a lot of future business by making the choices they made today. 

Chuck E Cheese if you want to market to kids, you need to put the kids first! (pretty simple)
Shame on you Chuck E Cheese for not doing the right thing."	0.0

We ordered lunch, me the buffet (what a joke--pizza and salad?), I ordered chicken nuggets for my grandson the cashier Alexa asked if we wanted FRIES, I said yes, my sister ordered a wrap and FRIES, we waited over 40 minutes for the order and there were only a handful of people in there.  When we got it, the FRIEs which were hash brown nuggets were ice cold, the chicken nuggets were burnt.  I took it back up there and was told they are so sorry but they now serve hash brown nuggets not FRIEs, well then why did ALEXA ask if we wanted FRIEs?  They did not offer to reimburse me for any of the food we DID NOT EAT and sent back.  All that food was not home made and should never have taken 40 minutes to prepare.  When I told ALEXA I was going to write a review on YELP, she said, ""go ahead, have fun"", laughed at me and walked away.  What kind of customer service do you call this?  There is was a boy behind the counter also who just said, ""we don't have FRIEs"" even when I asked why she offered FRIEs to us?  This may not seem like a big deal, but I spent $28 in there and my grandson got nothing to eat as did my sister.  Instead of speaking to the two older gentlemen who were managers there, they chose to ridicule me and tell me to have fun writing a review.  Customer Service?  Is this the norm for Chuck E Cheese?  I am writing to corporate about this."	0.0

Unfortunately, I don't eat meat anymore. That didn't persuade us to stop going. We still loved the place even though I was limited. But, our last couple of visits were bad. We no longer go. The first time we noticed a difference the majority of the food looked... old, stale, they were mostly empty. It was three hours before closing so we thought that was weird. We ate anyway and went on our way.

The next time there was a very long, kind of awful, hair cooked into my food. I pulled it out of my mouth and noticed that it wasn't from me. I lost my appetite. I had not eaten much at all so I pushed the plate away and sat with my boyfriend while he ate. (He didn't go through what I went through I guess?)

Needless to say, the waitress came over and asked if I was done with a puzzled look. I alarmed her of what happened and she literally rolled it off her shoulder as if it was normal for her to hear. I then sat back and didn't get another plate. 

I didn't appreciate how they handled the situation but we spoke to a few other people at the restaurant to make sure they knew. It was pretty gross. We haven't gone back since, in over six months."	3.0

Then I discovered Shanghai super buffet at Bell Rd. and 42nd Ave. on a trip to the west side.  Now Shanghai is locked up tight with a notice on the door and their phone is out of service.

So I stopped at New China on the way back and was as disappointed as ever.  Their selection is weak, the staff is unfriendly and the atmosphere is disappointing. 

I guess as I miss Shanghai super buffet more and more, I'll drive farther and farther to find one anywhere as good as Shanghai (without going to Shanghai).  :)

This buffet over the past YEAR has scored grade ""A"" for the past twelve months so it seemed worthy of a try. I note all the food I tried seemed fresh and nothing seemed old. Most pans were kept filled. This buffet is inexpensive (around $12.00 on the weekend) and it's a very large buffet.

The atmosphere looks slightly dated but seems clean. To me the dining room reminds me on a convalescent home because of the wide chairs on wheels.

The staff at the hostess desk didn't greet us but did seat us quickly. I started by trying some sushi. For buffet sushi it was edible. 

Then I did a small sampling of Asian type dishes. I tried 4 kinds of chicken dishes and the chicken was nicely prepared and seemed an above average quality for a budget buffet but all tasted the same no matter what I tried. All the chicken was in a sweet sauce that was slightly Asian tasting. An attractive pan of mixed vegetables was on the buffet....I thought I'd enjoy but DANG they tasted just like the chicken. That same sweet and slightly Asian taste.

The beef dish, pork dish and the salmon looked fresh made but you could tell by just looking at them they were over cooked. The salmon had lots of albumin formation and it looked like egg whites coming out of the salmon. 

They had a breaded fish and I tried a chunk. The fish tasted like swai and had a panko coating that seemed oil free but was also free of seasoning.

I saw a very strange looking pan of macaroni and cheese. The actual pasta was orange in color.

The one thing I tried that actually seemed delicious was an egg tart. It had a light perfect crust and the filling was smooth and rich and tasted slightly sweet and cheesy.

They offer an assortment of desserts, ice cream and some fresh fruit.

Our server was efficient with the clearing of plates and offering refills but rolled her eyes when my husband wanted a refill. She seemed depressed the whole time we were there.

It wouldn't take much for this to be a good buffet..some things shouldn't be over cooked and much of the food only needs to be seasoned in a better tasting way.

It's clean and fresher than most buffets that I tried.

I rarely, if ever, complain in restaurants, preferring to rant afterwards to my fellow diners. But I just couldn't let it go this time. The second star was earned because the manager acknowledged waiting over an hour to get our food was unacceptable and discounted a portion of the meal.

WE WILL NEVER RETURN. The place was filthy.  Crap all over the floor.  Four booths and a long table were not cleaned during the hour and 1/2 we were there.  We cleaned our own. Glad we brought handwipes  Had to ask twice for an ice machine fill.  Women's rest room was cluttered with trash and TP.  Only roll left was on the floor. Trash runneth over.  Men's was the same.  Hand towels would not fit in trash, so on the floor they went.  Grossest was the bloody bandage stuffed into the seat cover holder.Way beyond understaffed.  Sunday PM 4:00.

My 2nd family and I used to have a tradition of coming to this location every Friday. Service was always good and they always remembered us well. It was always a little busy and messy from leftover food but we would just request someone come and clean a table for us.

It seems ever since this location was remodel it's gotten out of control. This place is PACKED. It literally is so bad you cannot even walk to refill a drink without being trampled or almost knocking over or stepping on someone's child. It probably has to do a lot with this side of town but the customers are ghetto. I probably would not recommend bringing small children here because they will most likely be trampled or assaulted by another child. There is even a police officer on duty inside. I am going to guess it has a lot to do with people not watching their kids and the potential for someone to easily take someone's child. 

Because it is so packed the food is slow, and if you actually find an open table it's most likely still covered in trash. I would suggest saving your night by being ruined by other people's children and visit another location.

I specifically waited for my sister to arrive so that we can order our food at the same time and so we can all eat at the same time. She ordered a x-large pepperoni pizza, I ordered a family pack that came with tokens and drinks and a large pizza, I ordered pepperoni and black olives. We received our buzzer our cashier told us it would buzz in 15/10 minutes, so we filled up our kids drinks and all sat and waited . The buzzer rang litlerally like 3/4 minutes after we picked our seat! But only my sisters pizza was done! Her pizza was cold and not an extra large I asked the woman who was serving the pizza this is an extra large and she answered me yes!! Not only that the pepperoni and a cheese were not even hot !!! Not even our children bothered to eat the rest of those slices after a few bites!  I went up to the front cashier and I complained and asked why was her pizza ready before my pepperoni and black olive pizza we ordered only one minute apart from each other and we received the same buzzer. . I'm so upset and so disappointed with the pizza.

This location has a very cheap conveyor belt type oven and this seems to change the flavor of the finished product (as well as the lack of corn meal on the bottom of the crust that I love so much ). On the plus side they do have a fast fryer machine that cooks wings to perfection :) maybe it has been just the few times I have been here but it seems that the establishment could be cleaner. I know that this is a huge undertaking with dirty kids hands constantly touching stuff. Lastly. The staff has always been friendly and courteous while ordering and dining in.  I want to rate this location higher but with the pizza oven pushing out pizza like it does I will not return.  Maybe only for a small order of perfect wings :)	0.0

The staff does not go above and beyond, or really even meet the standard expectations.

I like pizza that is still horizontal 30 min out of the oven, not the kind that is floppy and you can roll up.  My favorite is super thin crust Supreme, cooked extra crispy or well-done.  I love the crunch between your front teeth when it just  comes out of the oven.

I come to this location only because I want to use a coupon at Joanns directly across the mall.  I  have a PPP about 3 miles from my house, Miller and McDowell,  but it is not a corporate store, therefore does not serve the 3 salads. It only has a boring iceberg lettuce salad, to which you add your own tomatoes, and other ""salad bar"" ingredients.  I go to corporate stores only for the delicious caesar salad, which is full of cheese.

Each time I come to this Riverview Dobson/Rio Salado location, Michael, the very tall skinny white guy manager, is sooooo cheerful and pleasant!!!   I give him 5  stars!   

I only eat here during the lunch buffet. If I do not come during the weekdays when school is in session, the place, e.g. today Memorial Day  2017, is ransacked.  I think they should hire MORE people on days like this.  It is pathetic, for which I give one star.  Food particles all over the floor, 80% of the vacant booths have plates and food and trash in them, that STAYED UNCLEANED  long after the people who sat there left.  Those booths stayed UNcleaned the entire 2 hours I stayed there.  Would be nice to clean the tables, and clear the trash up so new people could enjoy the booths, especially by the windows.   Also food on the seats. I hate it when employees just brush the cheese and crumbs off the tables onto the benches for you to sit on.  

The plate dispensers were always empty.  How do you get the food with no plates.  I gues the dishwasher could not keep up, cos later I saw paper plates.  I said I come for the caesar salad, but I had to wait 30 min before I got some, cos no one had time to make more.  This is AFTER I already told several employees, that the caesar  salad needed replenishing.  Tho they did fill the bowl once, I missed out cos I was not already standing there waiting for them to make more salad.   Instead I was sitting at my table, which I cleared myself when I arrived.   FINALLY , I tell Mike, the manager about no salad, and he cheerfully makes more right away.  Mike is the only person who seems to ""do things right away"" upon request, yet he is only one person.   I mean, this man has it in his capacity, to do this and that ""right away"", when no one else does.  Maybe because he is ""extra help"", and does not have a specific assignment, such as making pizzas.  He does it all to move things along.

Well the trash and untidyness of the restaurant is less than 1 star.  It is one thing to have it be that way in the moment, but quite another deserving less than 1 star for it to be like that for HOURS, and see no one cleaning up from ""time to time"".  

Also the pizza maker, who makes the pizzas each time I go to Riverview location, does not spread the goodies to the edge of the pizza like I experience at the 40th Street and Thomas location.  Also 40th St  pizza is crispier, somehow.  It is not a fluke at both places, but happens again and again each time I go to both locations.  Same result.  It is all cos of Joanns coupons I go to this Riverview less desirable location.  40th St and Thomas is about the same distance for me.  

Oh boy, all those tables unbussed when I left after 2 pm (arrived at 12), Mike's 5  star service                             and attitude, just could not outweigh all that mess contrary to Mike's ""right away"" service, to make me give it a higher rating than 2.5 stars.  I assume higher management does not support Mike's level with MORE help during weekends and holidays.  

When I went out the door, I could hear the screaming kids in the restaurant, half way across the parking lot to Joanns.  I am a senior citizen who eats at PPP alone.  If I were a mother with 4 kids under the age of 10, I guess I wouldn't even notice the ""mess"", and food all over the seats and floor, and all that ""happy screaming and yelling"", would I?"	0.0

I am not sure if they were understaffed or just didn't know what was going on, a gentleman finally came up front and took our order as if we just got there. After ordering our pizza I went and played games with my son and half of the games were broken. After 30 minutes of playing the games we could get to work, I went and asked about our order (because there were only about 4 families in the whole place) and it was taking quite some time to get our pizza. When I asked the guy about our order he said it would be right up, 15 minutes later our pizza was finally ready. When I picked it up, they forgot we ordered wings with our pizza, so we had to wait for our wings to be made. The pizza was really dry and burnt tasting, the crust tasted like cardboard and the wings were tasteless, there was no buffalo sauce taste to them at all.

Came in for lunch on Friday, was seated and provided a menu.  We were planning a dinner out so asked for lunch sized portions.  $ off if you order from here to here on the menu, smaller.  Ok, I have the angel hair bolognese.  The owner rather than telling me they do not do that as a lunch he said spaghetti with meat sauce.  I guess it could be called that so said yes.  It went down from there.  There was anther altercation with a young lady about a $100 gift certificate.  You can't use that here, she left her meal that was just served. The manager/owner then said she was drunk to other customers.  Seemed perfectly good to me and explained the place had changed hands recently to my wife, before she left.

We discreetly flagged the waiter, told him and asked to move. The waiter later brought over a couple drinks. After a few minutes we heard escalating voices about six feet from us and within two feet of people sitting at the bar and a nearby table. Instead of taking the waiter into privacy, the man who I assume is the owner with the heavy N.Y. accent was yelling for at least fifteen minutes at the waiter about being free with HIS alcohol.

First off the 2 stars are for the food. The food was pretty amazing. I had the Chilean sea bass and it was divine. It was served on top of freshly made ravioli and it was incredible. Everyone else had very positive things to say about their dinner. For dessert we all shared 3 cannolis which tasted heavenly. So delicious.

Here is where it takes a turn for the worse...

Our bill arrived and we know that they don't do separate checks. Understandable. We were told we could split it up with our cards as long as we told them how much to charge. Fast forward 2 minutes...as I'm simply writing down how much to charge on each card, a older looking balding man approaches our table and starts mumbling about needing our table and that we have been taking too long. Are you kidding me? From start to end we were there a MAXIMUM of 1 hour, a party of 7 mind you! He then proceeds to come back and again states that we are taking forever with the cards and what is it going to take to get us out of there.

My wife is in the hospital here and we took a much deserved break for lunch.  We talked to the waiter and thought we had a good rapport with him.  He and the chef who came out were very nice to us .   He said that all of the pasta dishes were  $8 for lunch and would we like soup or salad.   Also when two of us ordered a glass of wine he recommended one and brought the bottle so we could have a sample.  In the end we ended up getting charged for the whole bottle of wine and extra for soup and salad.  What should have been a reasonable meal ended up costing over  $150!

1. We had a party of 10 on our business trip, men women, white, non whites. Stopped at the host stand and 
2. was rudely scolded by the woman for not making a reservation on a Thurs of spring training. 
Being sympathetic to her busy situation, I said it was our fault and we would go somewhere else.. She stopped me and said, no hang on. At this time a man (the owner) seemed very high strung told us if we wait about an hour, he would have a table. (he only saw me, not the others in our party, they were outside waiting)  
So we waited, some of us inside and some of us outside. After over an hour, I told the owner we understood his situation that he couldn't make people leave so we would go somewhere else. 
3. He said NO he was going to ""kick these old people out because they were late getting there"" YES HE SAID THAT
The hostess came over and asked if we wanted to sit outside and we said Yes of course, at that time the
4.  owner stopped her and said NO NO NO  
It was very uncomfortable but then he sat us at another table. 
The server arrived and began to ask for our drink orders. I asked for separate checks and he said 
5. We do not have separate checks. So I said ok, we can figure it out no problem....

During his delivery of the specials, one of my (non white) guests asked how the swordfish was... at which time the server, put his hand up, said AND I QUOTE
6. ""DO NOT INTERUPT ME WHEN I""M SPEAKING""
All of us were in such disbelief, I kept waiting to see if there was a punch line. Unfortunately, he was dead serious!! Needless to say, I spoke up and told him he should NEVER speak to ANYONE in that manner let a lone a guest of the restaurant. He tried to say it was because he was extremely busy. yayayayayaya blahahaha At which I requested an apology, He looked at ME and apologized, and I informed him to apologize to the gentleman. He did it very reluctantly . 

We SHOULD HAVE walked out at that point but we were so hungry we decided to just wait it out for our food. 
Food was good... I will say that. 
Next the check came. It was so OLD SCHOOL with 
7. nothing printed, only hand written out but ONLY the prices. We couldn't figure out what we were being charged for so we couldn't separate any of the bill. One of our guest tried to stop the server to request, at least a menu, if not something to explain the charges but he tried to avoid us by moving rapidly around the table. 
My guest stopped the owner, this is where is went REALLY bad,

8. The owner began raising his voice and telling my guest, ""I'm not your damn waiter, ask him""
9. my guest stood up and told the owner to calm down at which time the owner was yelling so hard, he was spitting on the neck of my guest!!!
We were so shocked, I wanted out of there so I picked up the check and paid for it. It was about to go REALLY bad really fast, 
Before I signed, I asked the waiter
10. , ""did you add gratuity?"" at which time he informed me he had tipped himself.  

I have managed restaurants for more years than that server has been alive, and I am shocked by what we experienced!!. Here is the piece de resistance.... 
We walked down the street to a nice bar. I asked one of the staff what was up with Italian grotto, he response was
11.  ""ya, everyone knows they are racist, Its because you had those 2 guys with you"", at this time he pointed to my ""NON white"" employees. 
IN MY OPINON  This appeared to be 
a. why he didn't want us sitting on the patio outside where we could be seen and
b. why it took so long for us to get sat and 
c. why the waiter was so rude to my non white friend. 
d. Clearly the owner wanted us out and never come back
I am from the south and I have never been treated so badly and so volatile. After reading all of these YELP comments This has confirmed my feelings about this place. To add further to it. I was told 
12. this is ""the place to go, for MLB scouts"" I would hope the MLB wouldn't support this kind of behavior!!!  
I highly suggest people think before they enter this place. 
I'm sure due to the high volume of tourist in this area, they will still be around, however, if I can keep one person from going there, then that is what I hope will happen. Shocked and discussed!"	11.0

I ordered  garlic bread and fettuccine Alfredo pasta with vegetables. It's very difficult to screw up Garlic bread but I must say these guys will do the impossible - my garlic bread was hard as stone. When I pointed this out to the server, he got the manager / owner who defended the uber hard exterior of garlic bread. I understand that these breads need to be crispy but one more bite of it and I would have gone straight to my dentist to undo the damage caused by this garlic bread from hell. Next on plate was the fettuccine Alfredo pasta. I actually checked under my table to check if there was dead animal because the smell of this entree was unbearable and it had way too much sauce in it. At this point i decided to just sneak out of there because I could not convince myself to pay for this utter crap that these guys label as Italian food. Do not go to this restaurant!	1.0

The waitstaff was extremely rude and standoff-ish.

The food is overpriced for what you get - I assume because it is in such a prime Old Town location. 

We sat in the back near the entrance to the kitchen. The ambience was..eclectic..to put it nicely. I feel like the paintings and oddly silver finished walls just didn't fit together. It didn't help that the place was dark, dingy, and a bit dirty (especially in the hallway near the kitchen and in the bathrooms). Some touristy food locations upsell you for the ambience .. we quickly learned this wasn't one of those places.

The food wasn't terrible. I went with baked cheese-stuffed ravioli. The sauce was great and the portions were good. I have to note that my starter salad was put together pretty oddly. They basically just dumped a huge dollop of blue cheese on top of a few pieces of lettuce and called it a day. A little bit of a rip of and just lazy service in my opinion.

Server was a bit pushy, but I wouldn't say rude. Overall, timely service and he didn't mess up anything. He actually ran out of the restaurant and chased us down the street because I forgot to sign the receipt - oops!

I came here on a beautiful New Years Day afternoon, with my boyfriend and my dog. Before sitting down, I asked one of the servers on staff if it was alright for me to have my dog sit down by our table while we ate. She's fifteen years old and was on a leash at the time, which I explicitly said. He said it was absolutely fine, no problems whatsoever, so I went to seat myself at the very end of the patio, furthest away from all the other tables so as to not disturb any other guests who might come along - it was totally empty.

About fifteen minutes later, while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, I gave my mom a quick call since she was wondering what time we'd be getting done eating. In the middle of my conversation with her, I heard someone talking loudly and aggressively next to me, so I looked over, and he was staring angrily at me. I asked him what he had said, and he acted like I had affronted him. So he even more angrily boomed, ""I SAID GET OFF YOUR PHONE, NOW. AND MOVE YOUR DOG, NOW. PLEAAASE."" I was utterly confused, not just by his psychotic rudeness, but by what he meant by that. My dog was laying at my feet under the table, not in anyone's way at all. He started talking about how it was HIS table and HIS chair and I had better get off the phone and was waving his hands and pointing at the chair where I had tethered her leash, all while my mom was talking to me in my ear. Very disorienting. But finally I understood that he wanted me to tether her to a different chair, even though there were 40 other empty chairs around us he could have used to seat the couple instead. In fact, the table they were being seated at already had two chairs. Bizarre.

I very calmly told him that he didn't have to speak so rudely. He starting going off about how I have no idea what I'm talking about and I don't respect anyone else's space and I was taking up two tables and it's his chair so he can tell me what to do with it. Since I had finally hung up, it clicked, ""Oh, this is your restaurant?"" I was totally baffled how someone who actually wanted to run a successful establishment would treat his customers like common criminals. ""YES, MA'AM. MINE."" That was all I needed to hear. We immediately left.

Myself and 3 others came here after our finding out the restaurant we originally wanted to go to had an hour wait. Honestly, we would have been better off waiting an hour for that place. Our worst decision of the evening was choosing this restaurant. We were seated right away, but didn't receive our actual meals until an hour later. We received our appetizers fairly quickly, but 30 minutes went by after that and we hadn't heard anything about where our food was. Servers were coming out of the kitchen left and right with everyone's plate but ours. Our server then told us that they were backed up. It wasn't that busy in there at the time, and it sure didn't seem like they were backed up if everyone around us were getting their dinners. We even saw people sit down after us, finish their meals, and leave! We stopped another waiter and asked what could be taking so long, and he said they were just busy. We waited, and waited. The man who sat us seemed to be the owner/manager of the place, so we got his attention and kindly asked if he could check on our food because now it's been 40 minutes since our appetizers. He preceded to argue with us and say ""I know when I sat you, and I sat you 20 minutes ago!"" I've never had the owner of a restaurant basically call us liars and talk so rudely to us. How he could stand there and say that in a stern voice to us when we were the ones sitting there looking at our watches the whole time - I'll never know.

 The management was just terrible. That is $15 I'll never spend on a meal there again. We were thrilled to finish our food and receive our checks. Hopefully they'll read the note we left on the back of our receipt..but I have a feeling they could care less if they ever see their customers twice because they get a lot of one timer tourists.

It looked like the had thrown pieces of pasta in with their marinara sauce, I have never tasted anything like it.  We had one order of Chicken Parmigiana a bit greasy and the sauce tasted like out of a can with a bunch of spices in it.  It was served over rigatoni, well I would say pieces of rigatoni.  It appears the use the left over pieces to put as the sides.  I was the brace one and ordered the Angel Hair Bolognase, oh my I can't begin to explain the taste.

Once we finally sat down it took way over 10 minutes for our server to acknowledge us . When he did, the manager appeared and asked him to move a table. In the middle of our drink order, the server left and didn't come back for another five minutes!

I was in Scottdale for business, and the local hotel recommended Italian Grotto for dinner.  We called ahead to see if we can make a reservation, they told us there aren't any reservations available, but the walk-in wait time is only 10 minutes.

Upon arriving (5 minute drive), the front desk person told us it would be at least a 30 minutes wait.  Fine, maybe a few large parties decided to show up between the time we called and when we arrived.  After 30 minutes, we were finally seated.

After being seated, we waited another 15 minutes for a waiter to stop by with water.  It took another 10 minutes for him to come back with the water and the menu for us to order.  By then, we have waited for a good 30 minutes before putting in our orders.  

We ordered fried calamari and zucchini, spaghetti w/ meatballs, sausage and peppers, and the shrimp scampi.  The waiter somehow messed up our order where our entree came out first without any appetizers.  After 10 minutes, we asked about the waiter to cancel the appetizers as we were already finishing our entrees.  The waiter said he would check, but came back with our appetizers 10 minutes afterwards.

To summarize our experience:

Good:
1. Great location, in the heart of old town

Bad:
1. Poor management - misjudged/misspoke wait-time just to get more business
2. Slow Waiters - it takes him at least 10 minutes to come back to our tables.  Took over 30 minutes to put in order despite us asking to order
3. Bad waiter attitude - even after making the mistake of not putting in our appetizer, the waiter would not own up and cancel our order.  Came back 10 minutes afterwards with our appetizers when we already finished our entrees
4. Mediocre food - everything was extra salty

Came upon the Italian Grotto which smelled good, Frank Sinatra music playing and a lovely outdoor patio. We decided to stop and unfortunately met the owner Gary. We have never experienced such a rude, crass individual.  The cushions on the seats needed replaced, and the table was less than steady. However, this was not an issue in the grand scheme of things, as Gary became quickly ruder as the seconds sent by. Simple questions concerning the menu were met with contempt.  For example, he would not bring us glasses of water, but only bottled water that we had to pay for.....interestingly there were glasses of tap water galore at other tables.  It was hard to believe that 4 confident, smart and outspoken women would be left speechless by such overt disrespect for the patron.  As were about to get up and leave before ordering we were rescued by a new waiter; Kris. He was polite, kind and attuned to our needs. 

By the way, the food was fine-nothing out of this world. The wine was good. The bathroom was disgustingly dirty.   

As we looked back on the day and finally read the reviews about the angry, erratic, rude owner, we wondered if this was all a marketing ploy??

One might wonder if the health inspector should go in and assess not the food in this restaurant, but rather the environment.

As a local I will not be taking my out of town guests there again. In fact, I will be quite vocal with others about this disturbing restaurant encounter."	1.0

I am a seasoned cook and foodie and eat out often, and by no means this is acceptable anywhere. Even when I used to live in NYC they would never get away with charging that, and if so, it would be in a top notch restaurant in the city. 

The worst part was when my boyfriend's mom nicely requested a tad more cheese for her pasta and the owner almost dumped the whole cheese bowl in her plate!

Normally, if a restaurant is lame, which is rare, I won't even review it. But I am going to enjoy eviscerating this truly repulsive restaurant, not for the food, which was somewhat edible, but for the dishonest pricing and for the jerk who apparently owns the place.

My girlfriend Carol and I were walking through Scottsdale. It was just past noon on a recent Sunday so we were thinking about lunch. We passed Italian Grotto and saw a menu posted outside on the wall. The ""lunch"" part of the menu had most entrees at $8. ""I'll treat you to lunch,"" she said. ""Sounds good,"" said I.

We went in and there were very few customers. Three or four people were sitting at the bar. We were seated quickly. The server, who was polite, brought us menus. The first thing we noticed was that there were no $8 items on it. All of the lunch items were priced at $13 or more. So we asked the server about the menu on the outside of the building. Here's what he said: ""Yes, those are $8 items if you get them al la carte."" Of course, al la carte suggests that you can get, say, the baked ravioli for $8 if you get nothing else on the side. But then the server added ""But these items do come with either soup or salad."" Hmmm? It clearly sounded like he was saying the lunch special was $8 and you still got a soup or salad. Carol and I looked at each other and shrugged our shoulders. I ordered the baked ravioli, she ordered a vegetable pasta dish.(Each of these were $8 on the outside menu but $13 on the menu he handed us. He clearly intimated that we were ordering items as a ""lunch special"".) We also ordered  a side of garlic bread and one iced tea. That's all we ordered.

As we awaited our meals, there was some person standing around the lobby and I heard him say something loudly about ""Jews"", which got my attention. He seemed drunk and a couple of the servers were standing around him so I thought ""some idiot""...and tuned him out. (And remember, this was just after noon!)

The food arrived and was fine. I got exactly four medium-sized ravioli on my plate, along with a salad. The drunk guy was quiet but still standing around the lobby like he owned the place. He looked a bit like Donald Trump, same age and attitude, and he wore a couple of rather large gold earrings in his left ear.

After we ate, we got the check and were shocked to see that it totaled $40. Not only that, but the entrees were written down as $14 each. What kind of weird mistake was this? Carol, who doesn't mind confronting issues like this, had me wait at the table while she went to find the waiter.Then I heard the loud guy yapping at her. I did not hear what he was saying but it sounded, at a distance, like he was arguing with her. As my attention turned to him, my girlfriend laughed a couple of times and I thought that this guy must be the manager or owner. (Carol is from Long Island and is used to New York attitudes so I figured all was good.) This one-sided conversation lasted 5 minutes or so. Then she came back with the bill and rolled her eyes saying ""Let's get outta here.""

As it turned out, the owner only deducted that extra two dollars from the bill (from $14 to $13 per entree) and, according to Carol, he reeked of alcohol and acted drunk. And obnoxious. He asked her to ""Get a load of the queers at the bar!"" And that was just the beginning of his tirade.

She said that the owner wondered why I, the boyfriend, wasn't paying the bill and that ""no woman should pay when a man can pay. I have six daughters and if they ever had to pay for a meal on a date, the boyfriends would never be welcome in the house!"" Carol, thinking that the guy was just trying to act like a macho New Yorker, told him that she was from Long Island. In response he said ""Long Island isn't New York! Only spoiled brats live on Long Island. I grew up in Manhattan, in Chelsea, on 29th and 9th!"" 

He asked Carol why we were in Scottsdale. She said, ""We live in Tucson and have been visiting Arcosanti."" He said ""Why would you live in Tucson? It's a dump! I had a bagel business on 1st Ave. in Tucson and it was a terrible place!"" He also added, ""I was at Arcosanti a few years ago and it was dirty and hippies lived there."" I suppose this was the point in the conversation when Carol laughed and walked away.

As we were walking back to our car and Carol was relating this story, we knew that this information needs to get out. And seeing what many others have written about this restaurant, I think you can see we aren't exaggerating. 

The owner of Italian Grotto is some drunken misanthrope named Gary Horowitz (so why his comment about Jews?!) and no one should be supporting his business.

Then when we were walking out there was an older couple, probably in their mid 60's early 70's that were walking in.

Ordered angel hair bolognese and had to ask our server if it had meat in it or if there was a mistake because there was so little of it. He did take the dish back after we asked this, but the second wasn't much better. Also ordered linguini with ""white clam sauce"" which ended up being pasta in a flavorless watery broth.

People have had good things to say about the food, but I couldn't tell you because I was not allowed to spend my money here.  I would certainly never come back to this place ever again.

We walked into the restaurant, and headed towards the bar which is in the back because I didn't see anyone up front who looked like they worked there.  I lagged a little behind my wife because I was looking for someone who worked there because there we're a several empty tables.  Next thing I know, my wife is being ""escorted"" out by some old guy and I hear ""Restrooms are for customers only"". I'm a little confused, and I say I was heading for the bar, to which he replies ""Not in here you're not. GO somewhere else."" in a loud voice. At this point I was not even sure he worked there, because he was dressed casual and not like any of the employees I saw in the 30 seconds or so we'd been in the place. So he is pushing my wife out, not physically but by crowding her towards the door ranting ""It's not right"" over and over at a high volume.  I'm like, What just happened. I try to have a conversation with the guy outside, but just continues screaming at us.  Some guy comes up and blocks the owner and keeps telling me to ""walk away man"".  Not once did I ever raise my voice, despite being pretty angry at the treatment.  I am like, I am just trying to talk to the man to figure out what the heck just happened, and he keeps telling me to walk away. At his point I've realized the guy yelling at me is probably the owner.

We we walk around the block, and I go back into the restaurant because I'd like to address the disrespect my wife received. Again no one is up front so I wait.  A couple of minutes the owner or whomever comes from the back and asks if he can help me.  I'm thinking, you don't recognize me?  I mean if it were me, Id remember the appearance of someone I was shouting at, kicking of my restaurant, and yelling at on the sidewalk 15 minutes before, but apparently this must happen pretty often to not be memorable.  So I calmly say ""I'd like to have an adult conversation about what just happened.""  Then the lightbulb goes on, and he mutters ""I don't want to talk to you"", proceeds to brush past me and walks outside.  Note he didn't even kick me out, he just pushed passed me and left, leaving me standing in the restaurant.  So I follow outside and ask very calmly ""Can I just talk to you for a second.""  He starting into another tantrum standing on the sidewalk, saying ""I tried being nice, and it doesn't work"" over and over. At first I thought he might be drunk, based on his behavior and belligerent actions.  I can't be sure, but I honestly think this is just his personality, which in some ways is worse.

So he's got his back to me, and so I turn to leave and say something along the lines of ""Man, I've never been kicked out of someplace for walking up the bar."".  So he yells at my back ""You don't just walk into a place!""  I'm like, yeah you do, pretty much every restaurant I've ever been to.  If there is a host or hostess you say ""heading to the bar""; and if not you just take an open barstool.  I've certainly never been removed from an establishment for simply walking in;  actually this the first time I've ever been removed, ever.

They would not let her leave, with a bouncer (who the heck needs a bouncer at a restaurant?!) blocking her from leaving until she paid for her uneaten meal.  She was completely shook up when she called me to share her story.  I only wish she had called me before choosing this restaurant.  Put this guy out of business.

Caesar Salad was nothing but a plate of romaine lettuce tossed in vinegar and oil. No cheese, no anchovy. That my friends is not a Caesar Salad, that is a plate of romaine lettuce. Service was very attentive but rushed. Bread was so airy you could read the menu through it. Grilled chicken had to have been right out of a Sysco truck and we didn't have a good feeling about the restaurants cleanliness after using the washrooms.	0.0

The waiter was nice, not friendly (and that is okay with me, I am not taking him home, so I like that he was not trying to be over friendly.)  He asked us if we wanted appetizers and we said no, because when we eat appetizers we never finish our dinner.  After we placed our dinner order he asked us if we would like garlic bread, either plain or with tomatoes & cheese on it and we replied ""yes the tomatoes & cheese sounded good.""  The bread was soggy and I could tell the marinara sauce was from a can, it had a YUCKY metallic after taste.  A different person served us our dinner.  He was very pleasant but he was wearing a light gray polo shirt that full of stains all over the front. (I noticed this immediately because we were sitting next to the window and it was 5:00 so the sun was shining bright into the restaurant.)  This totally turned my stomach to see how dirty his shirt was.  Wearing a filthy shirt while serving food is completely unacceptable, especially when serving food in a ""fancy"" overpriced restaurant.  The least management can do for their employees is to supply them with clean shirts.  Our dinner was okay, not the best we have ever had but we were okay with the taste of the food.  When we received our bill there was an extra charge of $8.00 on it.  When I asked the waiter what it was for he said it was for the garlic bread.  I told him that the way he presented it to us, he made it seem as if the bread came with the dinner.  His response was ""Well I said ""if you want you can have...""  That was wrong on so many levels, he was purposely upselling his food.  THAT makes me angry, you should never trick your customers into buying food they don't want.  Why trick your customers?????

I posted on FB that we were trying a new restaurant so several people asked me how it was.  Apparently this place has a bad reputation.  There were 2 people at my office that said they too had a similar negative experience at this place.  I am pretty sure all the positive reviews here are NOT legitimate reviews. 

Also, when we were leaving we noticed the person who was at the front door when we initially found this past (who we believe to be the owner) was YELLING at the person who was working at the store next to him.  That was so unprofessional.  I will NEVER go back. Our advice is to go somewhere else."	4.0

My husband said that some of the muscles tasted very weird. There were only 4 shrimp in my dish. For $25 I would think they would serve more than 4 shrimp. The flavor was very strong and not good at all. They seated us at a table that had crumbs all over the table cloth, obviously not cleaned up since the previous customers. The atmosphere was dark and dank. The music they played was 60's which is fine but in an Italian restaurant I would think they would play something better suited. The decor was awful. Overall, I'd say the place was a dump and the food was not good. Especially not worth the price. The only real plus was that our waitress was attentive. I won't ever eat there again and wouldn't recommend this restaurant. The food is much better at an Olive Garden and cheaper.	1.0

I wish we didn't eat here.  

The ambience was very dark and smelled of sanitation. The restaurant just smelled old and rank. 

The food was terrible. The salad had old pieces of red cabbage, the dressing was sour and vinegary. The minestrone soup tastes like leather. The entrees were huge, and for the price they should be. However. The quality was so low and I smelled my fishy pasta from when the server came out of the kitchen. I had a seafood medley of 1 large old shrimp, 1 ok scallop, a bunch of old clams and mussels that smelled and tasted terrible, and calamari that was ok. The pasta noodles were fine however, the quality did not match the price.

I think this establishment needs to really refocus and read all these reviews and make a change. Italian Grotto is in the heart of old town, and people from other states and countries come to eat here and leave with a bad impression of AZ.

I am vegetarian so I ordered the spaghetti marinara. They basically heated stewed tomatoes and dumped them on pasta. Zero flavor, zero effort. My salad was equally terrible. Iceberg lettuce topped with about a pound of blue cheese dressing. My wine tasted skunky, like the bottle was opened the previous night and re-corked. The ""garlic"" bread, seemingly had no garlic, only cheap bread completely drenched in butter. The calamari was breaded and fried and had no seasoning, including salt. It came with ""marinara sauce"" that tasted tinny like it came out of a can and was heated up. I would call it tomato sauce - which is an  ingredient, not a finished product. If I am consuming that amount of fat and calories, I like it to be worth it, and it was not. Our bill was $87, and my boyfriend said it should have been half that and even at half price he would not have been pleased. I agree with him. I will never understand why people with no passion for food get into the restaurant business. I guess they just rely on the business of unsuspecting tourists who they know won't be back anyway. Disappointed and angry, quite frankly... Feeling ripped off. If you like fifties music, are from the midwest, and frequent the cracker barrel, you will find it quite chic.

When my husband made the reservation, he was asked if it was for a special occasion, and he told them it was my birthday. There was no acknowledgement during our visit.  The food was good other than the salad that was saturated in balsamic dressing and the minestrone soup was bland.  The real issue was with the waiter and the bill.  The bill was wrong and when we asked, the waiter acted unfamiliar with prices on the menu and claimed he was helping the owner out and did not work there full time.  When we called the owner over to the table, he was rude with us when we questioned what the waiter said.  The waiter had been there for 38 years and condoned the waiter's behavior.  Obviously personal integrity means nothing to the restaurant owner.  He actually told us to write a Yelp review and here it is.  I am appalled at how disrespectful the owner was to my husband and I.

I should have been weary when I was able to get a table here so quickly while the other places I wanted to check out had an hour plus wait time. I was on a schedule so had no choice. 
I really went back and forth with the star rating. I enjoyed my main dish but service was horrible and my experience was ruined multiple times. 
We started with wine and had to wait so long to even get the wine list, like c'mon how many times do I have to ask for it?
We were looking at the menu and our server asked if we would like Garlic Toast. Sure why not we could use something to munch on while we waited for our food. He never mentioned it was a charged item, he made it seem like do you want water and bread that comes complimentary. So that was an awkward shock when the bill came. Especially when it was so tiny yet still like $9.
I try to always get something new or something I can't get back home so when I saw the white Lasagna, I knew I had to order it. Picture this ribbons of noodles layered with ricotta cheese, spinach, mushrooms, and cream, then baked with mozzarella cheese. So much yum! It was in fact delicious, tiny but delicious!
Our waiter was hanging out with other patrons and ignoring us so we skipped on ordering dessert. I overheard others complaining so it's not a one time thing. 
This place has so much potential and is in such an ideal location!

I have decided that although I am not excited about wasting more of my time on this horrible establishment, but if I can keep them from making money off of at least one unsuspecting patron, I have succeeded. I will keep it relatively brief because my experience was not much different than most of the other one star experiences complete with rudeness and threats.

We were hanging out in Old Town one evening after spring training and decided to stop in. We walked up to the host stand and a line quickly started forming behind us. As my friend and I were wondering where the host was, the gentleman behind us (from another party) informed us that they never have a host and we should beware because when someone does show up, they will be very rude. Weird, we though. I asked his why he still came and he told me, ""for the food."" ""Well whatever"" we thought. We shall see for ourselves. He was right about the rude part. We never made it to the food part and I don't care because my hard earned dollars won't go to support such an awful family (it is apparently a family owned business).

The owner eventually stumbles up with his glass of wine. My friend says ""excuse me, we have a party of 3,"" to which he replies smugly, ""yeah I see that..."" Shortly thereafter, a server walks by and as we try to get his attention, he purposely ignores us.

Um ok.

Next, a server comes up to use the credit card machine. My friend says, ""excuse me but we have not been helped yet, is there a host?"" To which he replies, ""look, if you were sitting in my section, I would help you out, but you aren't, you are here. So you aren't my problem."" Charming.

Rinse and repeat with a third prince charming who says, ""whaddya want me to do, it's busy, etc. etc. [insert a few more obnoxious comments here]""

So now that my friend has been treated disrespectfully 3 times, I'm pretty irate and grace our resident jerk with a few choice words of my own. (hey, I'm not proud of it but well.....he deserved it). He looked shocked at a lady standing up for herself and wouldn't you know the big man threatens to call the police. I asked him to please do so (loudly and with an obscenity), but he declined. 

At first I thought that this was rudeness combined with an utter lack of respect for women. I do think that is true, but it goes further, as it does not seem that they have respect for any of their customers. However, if you can read all of these reviews of behavior that would be unbelievable if it weren't for the sheer QUANTITY of similar reviews, and still donate your cash, I would not respect you either."	14.0

The icing on the cake is we actually had to seek out our waiter to pay our bill after sitting for a good 20 minutes in which we saw the waiter just standing around. We are normally big tippers, but due to the horrible food and bad service our tip reflected that. The waiter then chased my husband down outside the restaurant to ask were we came from because he was obviously upset with his tip.

It was my grandfather's birthday, so we decided to go to old town Scottsdale to have a nice dinner. He felt like Italian food, so we decided to try this place out. At the door, a man was greeting guests. Later, I realized he was the owner. He seemed nice at first, assuring me that he was getting a table ready for my family. We were seated and the first noticeable thing about the restaurant was the noise level. The waiter was literally screaming at our faces to get our orders. And I though HE was rude???! Things were somehow about to get wayyyyy worse.

Even though we were 6 people and a baby, we only ordered 4 dishes. My grandparents always share, and the baby can't exactly eat a full plate of lasagna and garlic bread. We started our meal with Minestrone, a ""vegetarian"" soup. I found a piece of sausage in my soup, which I cannot eat. It's not a big deal, but at that point the soup was inedible. The owner was passing by, so my father got his attention. He told him about the sausage and explained that we could not eat it. Instead of apologizing, this dude started lecturing us. ""Stuff happens! I've owned this restaurant for 38 years and you expect me to be perfect? NNOO!"" All I wanted was a simple ""S-O-R-R-Y."" Do people not teach that word to their toddlers anymore? It certainly wasn't in this guy's vocabulary. So, after he left, I exclaimed ""Excuse me!"" to my family and we began talking about how rude his behavior was. This guy, who I assumed was a waiter, heard me and we made eye contact. He then walked away.

A few minutes later, the owner returned. He then decided to give us another condescending lecture. ""Well I saw your ticket and you are a party of 7 who only ordered 4 meals! I'm just sayin'. The soup is not a big deal- it happens once in a blue moon! Tomorrow is a new day and the sun will come up! I'm not gonna kill myself tryin' to make you people happy! I want to live a long life! BLAH BLAH BLAHHHHHH"" My grandmother asked him if he was going to bring me another soup. He then, in a very patronizing tone, asked me if I wanted another soup. I refused, since I was almost finished with my soup when I discovered the sausage anyways. He then went on to say ""I have 6 kids! I know that you need more food. Tell me what to bring and I'll bring it for you. You only ordered 4 meals. DOES ANYBODY HERE WANT A SOUP!!?!? "" I have to say, I feel bad for those kids. They probably get whipped on a daily basis. He left after we all refused, as the waiter I mentioned before smirked. We had had enough. We decided to leave while we still could. As we began to exit the table, the waiter saw us and realized what was happening. He came by and asked ""Is everyone leaving here?"" We said yes and continued to leave. ""I don't like being insulted like that,"" my father told him. ""Oh yeah?? Insulted? You only had 4 meals on your ticket! Now that's insulting! You can't even afford enough food to feed your family! This is MY restaurant! I'm done with you people! GO- GO! Keep moving! GET OUT OF HERE!! STOP THEIR MEALS!"" he yelled. At this point, I was worried that he was going to get physical. I decided this spawn of Satan could only be the owner's son.

We continued walking out of the restaurant, our jaws hanging open.The owner was at the door greeting his friends and regular costumers (how does he even have any of those??)  He then started yelling at my father! ""You can't even afford seven meals! I'd rather you people leave!"" Now, my father was mad. ""I'm a cardiologist! I can afford a meal! Do you expect the baby to eat a full meal???"" The owner replied, yelling and following my family as we turned from the restaurant, with ""A cardiologist? Oh, and I'm an astronaut! I'm going to the moon tomorrow!"" This dude certainly seemed high enough to get to the moon. ""Just don't end up in the ER!"" my father said. 

I was shaking after this incident. This dude needs to be in a mental hospital. His son can be his cellmate. I have a weird feeling he's going to send the mafia after me after he sees this review, but I don't really care. I need to preach out to people DO NOT GO HERE! THE OWNER IS A CRAZY LUNATIC!

The host was rude when we requested to sit at an outside table saying that because there were only 2 of us he'd lose money seating us at a 4 top table. The waiter was far from personable and made us feel guilty for asking anything. My husband had the Chicken Parmesan which was over-breaded and mushy and not much better than a frozen dinner. I had the Chicken Carolina which was over-seasoned and did not live up to its description.  The bathrooms were also dirty and beat up. Would NEVER go back.	8.0

The clams were fine, the dish was OK, the muscles were so rotten. When the dish came to our table my husband gagged and said it smelt like feet. I agree. I am an avid seafood lover and I knew by the smell that something wasn't right. And they ask you if you would like some garlic bread. Be careful because what they don't tell you is that they charge you $6 for it. All in all, I would not return...ever.	8.0

I'm not going to comment on prices since it's kind of telling with the location and all, but it's not a place I would afford to go to often.

The place houses a prominent bar, which was where all the people were at. We were early, the only ones sitting at a table. The windows were open which let in a lot of light, which was nice because the decor is 95% black. 

When the complementary bread came out, the bread and butter was cold. The butter seemed like it just thawed from being in a freezer. Cold bread is never, ever appetizing. This was incredibly disappointing because I have had GREAT breads at franchised restaurants, even. 

We had two appetizers: calamari and fried zucchini. The calamari was OK. The breading was so light it was almost unnoticeable. I did like how fresh the squid tasted. The zucchini was like getting a plate of sauteed zucchini. Breading was falling off and it looked extremely soggy. Also, we noticed the plate looked full because of fried battered pieces, not zucchini.

My boyfriend ordered the bass, oreganata (sp?) style, which was under pasta in a lemon butter sauce. His dish looked good but he couldn't finish it because it was a bit greasy and heavy for him. 

I had the cannelloni florentine, which was supposed to have veal and chicken inside it. The crepes were good (lol). The mixture inside looked like shredded, overprocessed.. something. The meat had a creamy texture, which is just weird. It was overloaded with cheese and cream sauce. I didn't enjoy it. 

Also, despite it being not busy, our waiter was rushed with us. Not sure why. When it started to get more crowded, he spent more time with people. Don't know if it was us or he decided to step up bc there were more people. 

Overall I might try something that doesn't have a lot of cheese but I don't think I could persuade my bf to come back. I'm not that eager to, either.

Today is the last time I set foot in this dump. My meal today was Sausage Parmigiana with spaghetti.

The spaghetti was cold and I'm basically put my napkin on it and didn't eat it.

So FRANK is pissed off and hungry.

6125	yA6dKNm_zl1ucZCnwW8ZCg	6.0	7.0	1.0	"Let me start by saying, I work in television. Specifically, I work on television shows that rip managers like the one here new assholes in front of millions of people. Say what you want about Kitchen Nightmares, Bar Rescue and Kitchen Impossible, but we take people like the manager that works here and kick them to the curb where lowlifes like her belong. The only thing I can say is I WISH we were shooting this bar so I could give this bitch what she deserves. The following is a detailed encounter with the WORST MANAGER I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY CAREER. Skip to the second to last paragraph if you just want the punchline. I'll understand. 

I'll set the scene for you: It's a Thursday night, my crew and I are on location working on said television show in Scottsdale. My boyfriend is from New York and we were looking to catch the Knicks game. Alas, we were pointed to ""the best Italian joint in Arizona"" by a neighboring bar owner. We walk on over and set up shop in a lovely little bar, we chat it up with the Bartender, TR, he's great, welcoming, from jersey, he even shares tales of the owner's history in New York. Everything is going swimmingly, what a great night out with friends, right? We order a few appetizers  bucket of clams, bucket of mussels and 3 light beers. All delicious. Atmosphere is beautiful, great old school music, just a great New Yorker's bar. 

One of our guys is an HUGE Ucla fan so of course, he brought his Ipad with him so he could stream the UCLA game. This is where shit begins to quickly go south. My friend asks the TR if he could use the wireless to stream a little better. TR kindly directs us to a heavy set, dark haired woman bundled up like she's never been in weather below 80 degrees before. My friend kindly approaches her and asks if she's the manager. Her reply: ""I don't work here"".... hmmm My friend and I are perplexed... Well that strange because  TR just said you were the manager. My friend, confused, turned to TR assuming he must have asked the wrong woman. Nope, that was her and she just told us she didn't work here. Annoyed but polite, my friend leans over to her to get her attention and confront her about saying she didn't work here. He's joking with her at first, with a smile on his face. Her quip back to my friend, no lie this is what she said, ""WHAT DO YOU WANT?"". My friend is taken back by her aggressive nature and explains all he was going to ask was if he could use the internet. She aggressively tells him she doesn't know the password and walks to the end of the bar, yells over customers to TR (the nicest bartender on the planet) not to direct customers to her and if they want internet ""THEY CAN PAY FOR 4G""*
*Personal Note: Bitch, we have 4G.

We kept our mouths shut until we finished our drinks and food. Contemplated staying because the locals at the bar acknowledged the manager is known for being a bitch. TR was so great and welcoming and apologized for her behavior. Sadly, despite TR's attempt, we had to leave out of purpose alone. We close our tab, take care of TR because he's awesome and make our way to the door. 

Before making our way completely out the door, my friend leans over to the manager and QUIETLY lets her know A) She's a terrible manager and B) we're leaving because of her. That's when she literally went Cat. 5-Batshit-Crazy on us. Screaming at my friend in front of the ENTIRE Restaurant, ""DON'T POINT YOUR FINGER AT ME!!!"" ""IF YOU WEREN'T SO CHEAP TO PAY FOR 4G YOU WOULDN'T HAVE THIS PROBLEM"" We let her know politely we're leaving and she's acting crazy to her reply, ""LEAVE MOTHER FUCKERS!"" Yep. She called us mother fuckers for asking if we could use the internet. ""DON'T FUCKING COME BACK HERE YOU CHEAP ASSHOLES."" Yep. That was another one that really stood out. 

It's a shame. We roll with a crew of 60 people and every city we're in, we take over a local bar and restaurant for the 3 weeks we're in town. We understand the hospitality industry and we applaud great work and most of the time overlook bad behavior. I can honestly say I've never experienced such shocking behavior from anyone in the industry ever. I'm still completely blown away by how incredibly aggressive this woman was and how such a great place can employ such toxic behavior. I can say, despite TR's attempt to get us to come back, myself, nor anyone from our crew will bring business here while we're in town. 

With Love,

Came here today with my family to have a nice lunch while out shopping in Old Town. Three of my family members ordered the Baked Ravioli, I ordered the Manicotti, and two others got Fettucini Alfredo, and Spaghetti with Marinara. We were not given any bread, so we ordered some garlic toast for $6. Each of our lunch plates cost $8 each, and were a la carte. When our food came out, everything looked fine except for the ravioli. There were literally 4 pieces of ravioli on one plate. 4 small pieces of ravioli for $8. That's not enough food for one person. We had to make an extra order of the garlic toast for another $6 so the ones who ordered ravioli could have some extra food. I got two pieces of Manicotti, which was okay. My sister was upset, and decided to talk to management about the portion sizes. The owner of the restaurant came out, started YELLING, and saying that she didn't care, and that if she comped meals of everyone who complained to her, she'd be out of business. WOW. My sister said that they should make people aware of how many pieces of ravioli come on the plate, and she said, ""We never tell people that. You guys actually got two pieces of Manicotti and you were only supposed to get one, so that should make up for it."" We were all very calm, and she kept raising her voice and being completely rude. She doesn't care about customer service. My family was visiting from out of town and this was our last day to spend together. We were just trying to have a nice lunch. We weren't asking for a refund, we just thought it would be nice if they could give more ravioli to the ones who ordered that, or at least comp the garlic toast we had to order just to give us more food. We paid $80 for that meal and everyone was still hungry when we left! They also told us after the fact that they normally give free bread before the meal, but they didn't do it for us. I have never been treated so rudely or had an experience like this before, especially not from the owner of the restaurant. I've eaten at plenty of restaurants in Old Town Scottsdale and never had an experience like this. I guess I will stick with Grimaldi's that's right down the road. Better food, and better portions, and the staff and owners are friendly and care about their customers and repeat business. Diana, you should be ASHAMED of yourself and the way you run your restaurant. That's exactly why on the day after Christmas, at the lunch hour, that your restaurant was mostly empty.

My fiancé ordered the sausage and peppers and I ordered the Seafood Alfredo. He said the sausage and peppers was okay, but maybe would have been better with pasta, but instead felt like he got a $5.00 sausage cut up with a splash of sauce.

Not only did he break every rule of serving etiquette, but he seemed to go out of his way to be disrespectful. He couldn't be bothered to give us a wine list, instead telling my cousin which wine she would want. (Which was dreadful). When I ask what he had that was very dry, he told me I'd like the Pinot Grigio because it was ""really dry and sweet"". I'm certain those two things are opposite. I did not try to correct him. I asked for the salad with dressing on the side. It came on the salad. I again did not say anything. I ordered the same dish as an other person at the table only mine was extra spicy. When I asked if mine was the spicy one, given his earlier mistake, I was admonished with ""well that's what you ordered isn't it?"". The general rudeness continued in every interaction with him until it culminated when I asked where the bathroom was. He just said ""in the back"". I asked for clarification and that's when he very condescendingly said ""oh let me lead you"". As I walked away he said, loud enough for the whole table to hear, that I was ""pretentious"".   I have never not left a tip, and was still planning on giving him the standard 20% until I heard he had said this. I left no tip, but a note recommending that he not speak poorly of patrons within ear shot of their companions. He chased me out of the restaurant, screaming at me down the side walk. 
The service was so poor that even if the food had been amazing I would still give this place 1 star, but the food was mediocre at best.

As an avid traveller, I have eaten in many establishments from mom and pop hole in the wall restaurants to top of the line fine dining from Seattle to California.

This place has the potential to be the place to dine in old Scottsdale with an awesome location and great patio, and old school charm, I have to say that was the main reason we stopped in.  I agree completely with the other reviewers that you should check your bill before paying because the bill is filled in by hand so you really have to know your prices or else you could be paying more than what the menu price is.  Really, a restaurant in the heart of Old Scottsdale should be electronic in 2015.

To start, no host, just an older fellow in street clothes (Jimmy Hendrix golf shirt) wandering the parameter of the patio and inside, and a heavy set gentleman tending to obvious regulars, over zealous as he was, seemed like a nice guy, that is if you were a regular...""how's you's doin? You's need anyting else?"" as I overheard.

Our waiter was nice enough, older guy who was just ok, but felt that he kept trying to up-sell us on booze and on bread...I'm off carbs but my husband gave in and we agreed. We specifically asked that there be no pork in any of the dishes, and was assured that won't be an issue.

Starter salad was way overdressed and was basically bagged lettuce mix with one slice of cucumber. Hello tomatoes? Onions? Olives? Anyone? Fail.

I tried the tomato cheese bread, because it looked really good and who doesn't love gooey, melty cheese? It was good but definitely not worth the $8 price tag for 4 small pieces, sauce was really acidic and the tomatoes on the bread were obviously canned. 

The entrees all arrived with a pasta, while there was a veg option, we were never offered this and was told after the fact that I should have asked for it. Luckily my sons dish came with little chunks of bacon so he ended up eating the side of pasta that came with my dish ( it was not mentioned anywhere in the description but we made sure to mention it when ordering the spaghetti and meat sauce for my other son, that there is not not be any pork in any of the dishes.) I ordered the steak of the day which was supposed to be a ribeye (it was not...and it was way over done) no sides with the steak just a slab of meat swimming in a butter lemon sauce.

 The waiter was nice enough to offer to make another dish for my kid without the bacon but seemed upset, when we pointed out the obvious mistake.  Then we noticed big meat chunks in the spaghetti in my other kids dish and he assured us that it was not pork...I wasn't buying it because it was very white in color and at this point I cut it open in front of him and showed him the color- said he was sure that they only use beef.  I just had to take his word for it and accept this entire dining experience as an expensive lesson learned.  

Bill was just under $100 with no drinks/booze, one app and 3 dishes...I later realized that $5 was tacked on to cover my sons starter salad even though he couldn't eat his meal because of the bacon- it's not a big deal but felt that was really tacky when it was obviously their mistake.

The fried calamari and artichoke were fried to a delicious, white coloration which, in the realm of fried foods, was about fourteen hues down from golden brown.
This created confusion in my already befuddled mind. Was it cooked or wasn't it? 
I Had to take a bite to solve the mystery. Unnerving.

I ordered an antipasto for two thinking I'd go light with meats, cheese, and relishes.
Another huge disappointment.
It looked like a salad with two buried slices of capicolla deep within and two, also buried, slices of salami. The remainder of the bowl was small bits of red and yellow peppers, about thirty pepperoncini, but mostly romaine tops. This was anything but a traditional antipasto, with the majority of the bowl comprised of lettuce.
I don't know why IG hides the meat and cheese, but it pissed me off. 
I felt like the catcher in a game of hide the salami. Literally!

I had to ask for bread since the antipasto was a bust. This made me feel like Oliver Twist begging for crumbs, and for no good reason at $12.95.
The only thing good about this place was nothing. 

I suspect they've remained in business all these years primarily due to their location, and all the unknowing tourists.

Was the single worst dining experience I have EVER had, simply due to the arrogance and attitude of EVERY person working here, from the server who was defensive unnecessarily,  to someone named Brandon aka ""Meatball"", to the host, who wouldn't seat my husband until I came back from using the ladies room?? (Huh?)  We should have immediately left at this point and saved our $90 instead of being ripped off and feeling like they raped us. 

Items of note about the experience this evening:
1.  We both ordered seafood fettuccine and it arrived WITHOUT any fettuccine!  It was made up of one shrimp, one scallop, a small chunk of ""fresh fish"" about the size of a golf ball, six mussels (the shells take up a lot of space in the bowl) and calamari which I thought was the fettuccini!!  The Alfredo sauce appeared as a very thin soup in the bowl, again, sans fettuccine!  Price was $28.00, times two, since we both ordered this. When we asked about why the seafood fettuccine came out without any fettuccine, we were told it was because we ordered the vegetable side, which was in place of the fettuccini. So if that weren't insulting enough, when the bill arrived, we were up-charged $5.00 for the side of fettuccine they brought when we initially asked where it was!  OMG!!  
2.  Brandon aka Meatball (he told us) was so defensive when our server (quickly and inexplicably) refused to deal with our concerns and went and got him, the last thing he said to us, was advice to ""stiff our server"" on his tip, since he didn't explain things as he should have. Say what!??  That was a first for me, hearing a manager give this directive regarding his employee. It's leadership at its finest, clearly. 
3.  Caesar salad was coated in dressing to the extent that I couldn't eat it. And not one crouton was included in this salad. Minestrone soup was mediocre. Had one small pat of butter with the four chunks of bread so had to ask for more butter. And the vegetable side was inedible. $90.00, folks. (This includes $20 for two vodka martinis, BTW.) 

Bottom line, these 350 reviews all mostly speak to the same types of issues, which involve poor attitudes, overpriced items for mediocre food, at best, and they are so good by this point of talking over you and immediately going on the defensive, they just flat out do not care whether you are satisfied or not. So lesson learned. When it comes to this joke of a place in Old Scottsdale with the primo location, save your money and ALWAYS, ALWAYS READ THE YELP REVIEWS regardless of where you go to dine. All these people can't be that wrong!!!

I don't care if everyone in your party hasn't arrived. You should still be seated with a reservation before walk ins. Instead we were told they no longer had a table inside for us so we had to desk with traffic and car fumes through our meal.  And I was told I was complaining and what a bad day they were having.

Having been to the Italian Grotto in the past where I've enjoyed the relaxed and welcoming atmosphere surrounded by sounds of Italian accents. She loves the Italian culture, so for all these reasons, we stopped in for a glass of wine. Within moments, the bartender threw down her driver's license, expressing his dismay about ""the Jersey people."" Not a huge deal; perhaps this is just one of those people with a dry, crass sense of humor. Being from Jersey himself, my daughter-in-law tried to engage him in a friendly conversation about West Orange and East Orange. He interrupted, and negated this with, ""No. The blacks are from...."" The blacks. This all happened within minutes of sitting down, and this exchange made me extremely uncomfortable.

Our party of 8 was greeted at the door by a rude owner who told us we had to finish our meal in an hour because he had another group coming in and needed our table. At this point we should have left but We sat down and ordered our appetizers. Our order of zucchini and calamari was a disgrace. The portions was so small and the price of 9.00 was outrageous. The special of seafood fettuccine should have been called soup. Sauce was watery and missing most of the seafood. Not sure how this place is still in business with all the truly fine restaurants in Scottsdale.

When we ask how long it's going to be for a table he ignores the question, so we ask again.  He then threatens to punch me in the face and we should go somewhere else.  Which we did, happily.

The owner who was definitely drunk didn't listen to the problem I was having with my meal before blowing up... So here's what happened we walked in and it took 5 mins before anyone came to seat us, no biggie . The server comes up no apology or anything,but again no biggie . We are seated next to the kitchen door even though there are multiple tables available. I'm hungry so I don't say anything but at this point I'm feeling like this guy has something personal against me haha. He hands us our menus and walks away. No drink orders or anything! So I call him back and ask him to take our drink orders and he still has no apology... Who trained this guy? So he comes back to take our orders and I ordered the red snapper and my girlfriend orders a plate of spaghetti. The food arrives and to be honest it smelled good and I was excited to chow down... I took a bite and the taste was just off... I tried to eat it any way because I really didn't feel like dealing with the server again. But after maybe 5 bites I couldn't take anymore... I called over the server and told him that I think the fish may be old and that it has a bad taste he just looked at me like I was an idiot... And I  guess the owner heard me because he rushed to the table basically yelling that his fish is fresh and that the fish I was eating was just shipped that morning... I waited for him to finish and asked for my money back and told him we would take our business elsewhere. His face got red like I asked if I could kiss his wife or something...  He yells a bit louder now that the fish was half eaten and that we would have to pay for it... By this time the whole room is staring at us. I threw down some cash on the table and my girlfriend and I walked out.... 
This was by far the weirdest, worst restaurant experience of my life... These guys need to be shut down or need a change of ownership...

I was in town on March 13, 2015 for spring training with some friends and it was a Saturday night. Every restaurant was busy so I stopped into this place to ask if they had any availability. I was talking to a nice young woman when a greasy haired man with erratic behavior (who I discovered later was the owner, Gary) interrupted and said ""No, there's nothing."" I asked if he could recommend any other place. He answered, ""You won't get in anywhere, I recommend nothing. Everything is full."" Perturbed at this odd response, I said, ""So are you saying we should leave Scottsdale?"" Gary suddenly flew into a rage and asked me if I was f---ing with him. He yelled, ""I gave you a good answer and that's what you ask?"" He then stalked off. 

Shocked, I asked the young woman who that crazy person was and when she answered, ""my father,"" I felt such pity for her.  She explained that Saturdays are busy and she tried to smooth everything over. I thanked her for being polite and left with my friends. After a few moments, Gary comes outside and proclaims that he wants to ""make amends to whoever he offended"" and that he ""has a table for us right away."" I told him it was me he offended and when I balked at dining at his restaurant after what happened, Gary stalked away again and gave me the f--- you. You would think that after all these pages and pages of negative reviews about this disturbed man's behavior, that someone would GET A CLUE and GO TO REHAB.

We sat 20 min before the waitress took our drink order forgot the delicious little bread they serve while ur waiting but brought out the salads pretty promptly.  Our waitress wasnt the brightest and everytime we asked for something she did a rolling of the eyes number and seemed bothered honestly she shouldnt be working at red lobster with everything she had to be reminded of she is more mcdonalds material it may be management but no idea anyways when the food was brought out everything tasted just okay we were a party of 5 ( 3 children, 2 adults) and it was just mediocre food and bad service ended up spending 124 with the tip which if i was rude i really would have only gave 5 dollars because that is literally what the waitress should have gotten.

I went to this location last night with my boyfriend, his mother, and her fiancé. Our server was in training, and the girl ""supervising"" her was off at another table. I ordered the Sangria and my boyfriend order a Fat Tire. When the drinks were delivered, the server spilled the ENTIRE sangria in his lap. Luckily he was wearing leather pants, so he just dried himself off. However, his $300+ shoes were soaked. 

To attempt to make up for this spill (let's face it, spills happen), the manager said she would send a comped appetizer to us. Well that never showed up. Apparently there was a miscommunication.

Fast forward, the meal finally comes. The food was great, thank god! I ask for a box for my leftovers, and we ask for some of the biscuits to go. 

Later that night, my boyfriend says, ""I'm going to eat all the biscuits."" I asked him to save me one, and thank god he didn't eat it. I microwaved the last biscuit this morning, and bit down into it, only to find a MASSIVE piece of glass embedded in the biscuit. I can't be sure if the glass was intentionally put there, or if it may have gotten mixed in earlier, but it certainly seems fishy. I will definitely be pursuing some kind of legal action & involving the news because this is UNACCEPTABLE and will never happen again. $87 (before tip) with a comped meal & appetizer will never be worth what I found.

We sat at the bar and I watched the bartender struggle to keep up on a very slow night. I watched her make a customers drink wrong. It was a martini...she made it in a rocks glass with a ton of ice. About 6 minutes later the customer was able to get her attention to let the bartender know she wanted it in a martini glass without ice. The bartender took the glass poured in a shaker and poured the now super watered down drink into a martini glass. The bartended should have known by the look of dissatisfaction on the customers face that she was not happy. She should've just remade that drink. 

I watched her place her hands on the inside of every glass she grabbed. Granted she probably washed them but it still wasn't necessary to finger fudge everyone's glasses. 

The food was quite mediocre. Salmon was over cooked. The highlight of the meal was the whipped sweet potatoes.

The meal started with the four of us being seated at a table large enough for six.  This was nice until the waiter came over.  He placed the plates and silverware at the two people nearest him and then literally tossed the plates and silverware to us rather than walking around the table.
I ordered the oysters.  These must have been frozen at some point, they were watery and tasteless.  Even my brother didn't want to finish them.
I ordered a salad with ""bleu cheese"" dressing.  The dressing was thin and tasteless, very little blue cheese flavor.
For my entree I ordered the ""fresh catch"" which was a Pacific rockfish, blackened.  The fish was way overcooked and the blackening was really tasteless.  This came with sides of rice pilaf and broccoli.  Both were undercooked.
I left over half of my food when we left and the waiter didn't ask anything about the food and why I had left it.

When I say HORRIBLE I mean it took her 15 min to come to our table and take our order, luckily she was ""training"" someone who only came to get our drink order. When Nicole took our order she wasn't friendly at all but at this point we weren't really irritated by the service YET. We order and the food takes 30-40 min to come out. Mind you it's not even busy. Someone else brought our food out and our lobster tails looked DISGUSTING! As soon as they put the plate down I looked at my lobster and knew it was overcooked. Once I bit into it, it was so rubbery! But Nicole was no where to be found to request a new lobster tail and we were starving because we were waiting so long and we just ate it. Also, the biscuits weren't fresh at all so we couldn't even snack on those because they were room temperature. We're in the middle of eating and our drinks were empty for 30 min. We slide the glasses to the end of the table HOPING Nicole would come and fill our drinks up, but of course that didn't happen. Our drinks were empty for 30 minutes!! This is NOT an exaggeration, I know it sounds bad and it was THAT BAD! Then Nicole comes and brings the check! I say I would like more water please but I NEVER got my water.

 I walk up to the hostess and I request to speak to the manager. Ten minutes go by and the manager still hasn't came but I'm not even sure the hostess informed him, so Nicole walks by and says are you ready for me to close you out? I said no, I would like to speak to you manager please and she says ABSOLUTELY with the fakest smile on her face. The manager Luis comes and I express my dissatisfaction and how angry we are. I tell him this is completely unacceptable to be treated this way for a meal that isn't cheap ($35 a plate). Luis was very nice and tried to rectify the situation the best he could. He offered us anther lobster, dessert, and even comp'd our entire meal.  

The sad part is I feel like Red Lobster is going down hill, my family and I used to go all the time and the only reason my boyfriend and I came tonight was because Olive Garden next door had a 35 min wait and Red Lobster was convenient because it was later.

Anyways, they got their $120.00 and I got completely ripped off.... so, they are happy and don't care if I won't come back.... but hopefully, these bad reviews will help others notice that this place is a typical waste of space in a part of town that is garbage. The food is as good as the people who live around the same area, why would you expect? Need I say more..... probably not, they know what I'm saying and you do too. This place is a rip off and not good food at all... I can't believe I went here.... going to the ghetto to eat nasty food is not a good idea, you'll get what you paid for, poopy food made by ghetto people. Go somewhere else and stay away. 

Plus, I had some lame hipster Mexican waitress that had gauges in her ears and was a wannabe Betty Paige and every time I asked how something was, she said ""ITS SO BOMB, MY HUSBAND LOVES IT""!!!! SHE WAS FAKER THAN A $3 BILL.... CANT WAIT TO SEE OTHER REVIEWS, THIS PLACE IS THE WORST."	0.0

We knew it wouldn't be as fresh as Maine since it does have to be frozen for travel, but this was awful. The food actively smelled rancid and tasted rotten. I couldn't even eat part of my meal. My husband who will eat pretty much anything only ate about a quarter of his meal. The only reason they get two stars is because the waitstaff was very nice and professional.	0.0

Our waiter came back and asked how everything was and I told him the texture and temperature of my key lime pie was unsatisfactory to which he replied ""oh yeah, they're frozen, they put them in the microwave to defrost sometimes "" I paid full price for my meal with an inedible desert. I'm appalled at the way your wait staff just brush off microwaving food, if I wanted to eat a  microwaved key lime pie, I sure as heck wouldn't be at a red lobster trying to have dinner with my husband. It's a shame. I haven't eaten at a red lobster since approximately 2009 and had a terrible experience then, I hoped they would've changed. Apparently not."	0.0

We told them to hold the food until we had our salad and when they brought the food it was cold.. Should have gone to McDonald's and had a fish sandwich. At least you know what to expect.	0.0

First of all, it's LUNCH TIME why don't you have enough servers for 22 guests? They gave us the option of sitting at the bar for faster service. We were THE ONLY people at the bar. There were THREE servers standing around at the bar watching ONE person make A SINGLE DRINK for over 8 minutes. NONE OF THE THREE even so much as said ""hello"" - no one said they'd be with us in a minute. Nothing. We were literally ignored the entire time. Needless to say we left and will not be back. We understand busy. We understand lunch time. This place was like a ghost town and no one could even acknowledge us."	2.0

This one is generally run by teenagers, who neither care nor know what customer service is.

I realize it's a Little Cesar's and there's not much to be expected, however it was National Pizza Day and I've been craving pizza for a week, still am actually. First they open at 10am, I arrived early so I went to a couple nearby stores first, I walked in around 10:20, I was greeted promptly, and waited only a couple minutes, that was good. However when I politely asked for a deep deep dish I was told in broken English those were only served 11a-2pm, I know this is untrue as my roommate often picks them up after he gets off at 330pm. It was not stated that, that was the times for Hot n Ready just that, that was the time frame they were served. There was no signage saying anything about times at all. After that was stated I kinda just stood there silently trying to figure what to say next in order to still get what I wanted in pristine condition. I chose to just walk out instead as I couldn't think of a polite way to say that was ridiculous and untrue. It was completely unprofessional and I'm not entirely sure why it happened.	4.0

I have been there at least 5 times.  The motto is hot and ready.  Well let me tell you the pizza is never ready.  Have never been able to pick up a regular cheese pizza.  Always have to wait.  The gave me a pepperoni the last time after waiting and did not discover their mistake until I got home.  Called and ripped the manager a new one.  Trust me don't stop.	0.0
