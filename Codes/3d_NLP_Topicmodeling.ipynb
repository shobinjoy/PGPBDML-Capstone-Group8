    "## Topic Identification using Latent Dirichlet Allocation Model\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective of this document is to identify the various topics avaialable. We are going through following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.Read the data from the file\n",
    "    2.Filter the data to get the low rated reviews only\n",
    "    3.Identify the non english reviews and remove the corresponding reviews as we can work only with English reviews\n",
    "    3.Next we have cleared any special characters and number from the review text\n",
    "    4.changed the casing of the text to lower case to ensure that we get same format for lemmatised text\n",
    "    5.We have used english stopwords from nltk.corpus library to remove the stopwords fro review text\n",
    "    7.We have taken the cleaned text from above to identify the topics.\n",
    "\n",
    "To identify the topics we have used an Latent Dirichlet allocation algorithm. We have performed following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1.We assume that each review text is one document.\n",
    "    2.We have calculated the bigrams and corresponding polarity of the bigrams from the cleaned text.\n",
    "    3.We have calculated the polarity of each document to identify the negative bigrams using the textblob library.\n",
    "    4.Filtered out all the positive and the neutral bigrams to ensure that we are working with only negative bigrams.\n",
    "    5.Used the CountVectorizer for all the reviews to create the sparse matrix.\n",
    "    6.Used sklearn.LatentDirichletAllocation model with gridsearch with number of topics ranging from 3 to 10. \n",
    "    7. With maximumloglikelyhood, it has been identified that the best number of topics is 3.\n",
    "    8. Validated the outcome of the LDA model with manual labelling of 110 reviews. The accuracy was found to 68%.\n",
    "    9. Labelled the reviews with the model as food, service and others.\n",
    "    10. Persisted the data for UI presentation\n"
