    "The objective of this document is to get the top 5 most negative bigrams for individual business.\n",
    "We are going through following steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Read the data from the file\n",
    "2. Filter the data to get the low rated reviews only\n",
    "3. Identify the non-English reviews and remove the corresponding reviews as we can work only with English reviews\n",
    "4. Create a dataframe for business by taking only business information from above dataframe\n",
    "5. Create a new column in the business dataframe to keep 5 sample reviews for UI display\n",
    "6. join all the reviews of individual business\n",
    "7. Next we have cleared any special characters and number from the review text\n",
    "8. changed the casing of the text to lower case to ensure that we get same format for lemmatized text\n",
    "9. We have used English stopwords from nltk.corpus library to remove the stopwords from review text\n",
    "10. We have taken the cleaned text from above and created the bigrams\n",
    "\n",
    "To create Bigrams and take top 5 we have performed following on the joined text of each business, \n",
    "\n",
    "1. We have taken cleaned data for each business and created list of bigrams by using consecutive 2 words.\n",
    "2. Calculated the polarity of each bigram by using the TEXTBLOB library\n",
    "3. Sorted the bigrams in descending order of polarity\n",
    "4. taken the top 5 Bigrams based on polarity score\n",
    "5. saved the data in csv file for presentation on UI\n",
    "\n",
    "***Note that we are not lemmatizing the token here as the bigrams will make more sense in original format\n"

Day after day, they run out of pretty much everything half way through the day, including probably the most popular item, grilled chicken. They don't even care to have the food prepared by 11am, which is the time they tell everyone the main food options will be available by. Along with many other students, I am sick and tired of shitty food and horrible service by the workers. Except for Ashley, she has always been happy and smiling. Everything about this dining hall has been awful and if there were a way for me to take my money back, and put that towards something else, preferably food that is edible, I would greatly appreciate it. Hopefully this will reach the eyes of someone in charge so they can change these ways and start making students happy. But until then, Keep up the shitty service.\")"
