# PGPBDML-Capstone-Group8
Capstone project on Restaurant recommendation and improvement on Yelp data for Post Graduate Program-Big Data and Machine Learning for Great Lakes Institute of Management, Chennai

We are trying to solve 2 use cases:
## 1. Recommending Restaurants to customers - ##
Based on their prefernece (both Explicit and Implicit) using Recommendation Systems algorithm. UI was created by connecting HTML page to Python code on Django Framework. In UI, we were able to show the Popular Restaurants in the city of choice, Restaurants based on the selected Criteria of Cuisines and attributes, Restaurants based on the other similar restaurants visited by the user. 
## 2. Recommending Improvements to Restaurants - ##
Based on Natural Language processing on Low rated Review texts. We were able to identify the major topics that a low rated Restaurants need to work on to improve their rating and business.

## Tools and Techniques
1. Python
2. Tableau for EDA
3. Machine Learning algorithm for Recommended Systems ("surprise" library using SVD, KNN)
4. Natural Language Processing
5. WebUI using Django Framework
