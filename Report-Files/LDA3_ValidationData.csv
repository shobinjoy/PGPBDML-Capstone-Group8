I love chick fil a and was so excited when they built this location.  Unfortunately this has to be the worst  chick fil a I've ever been to from a food and customer service experience.  Either the teams are understaffed or not incentivized like other locations.   I hope the owner figures it out bc I live 2 miles away and drive up to the Chandler Ave location bc the service is so poor on Az ave.,0,1,0,3,3
"I've gone here before love the food but the costumer service is totally horrible. I was at the drive thru placing my order after each time I said I wanted something the employee working the window constantly repeated ""anything else"" I told him yes proceeded to order and he asked again. I still wasn't done ordering. It was as though he was rushing me and I did feel very rushed. I pulled up to the window and there he was still rushing. I gave half cash and half card. I told him I have cash I want to give you and what ever is left place on the card. Tell me why he ran my card twice for both amounts. So at this point I'm pissed off. I asked for the manager she said that she could refund it back to my card and just recharge me. I said no give me my cash back and I'll take the food. So she took my card back and refunded me the money never once told me she was going to when I told her that it was okay to leave it alone. Here I am sitting in the drive thru waiting for food and she comes back and says ""Did you still want the food?"" Ugh no I'm just sitting here waiting for nothing yes I wanted to the food at that point I was super pissed off and left ! Never once did she apologize to me for his actions and never once did she apologize to me for waiting for nothing. I asked for his, her and her managers name I told her I would be calling him very next day and her response was OKAY BYE. Yeah worst service if ever have. I understand it's in a ghetto location and the staff probably doesn't even have a high school diploma and apparently don't have listening skills either but dam. Will never visit again!!!!",0,1,0,3,3
"If there were negative Stars, I would give them out instead of one star. This place is a disgrace to anyone that likes even mediocre food. Breakfast used to be decent, but they hire, I assume, parolees or people on work release that worked in the prison chow hall. The ""omelet"" I ordered was a mess of veggies and some ham and cheese on the bottom of my plate. Why is there cheese on the bottom of my plate? Because the ""cook"", and I use that term VERY loosely, did not know how to make an omelet so he put the cheese on top of the eggs, and flipped the whole thing onto my plate. There used to be a good cook, but like most things around that kitchen, if they are good at their job, they get rid of them, you know, because people might like their food and come back. Boeing needs to really reassess their food service vendor and like someone else previously mentioned, do what Intel did, and hire a company that takes pride in their job. Boeing employees deserve better than this.",0,0,1,1,1
"This is for nocawich express. Absolutely terrible. Had to run through the airport and saw this little sandwich shop. Packaging looked clean and they had clever names for their sandwiches. I grabbed the roast beef sandwich and an orange juice, paid and ran to the gate. Then as I took a few bites, it was soggy, meat was tough (had to spit out a few bites) and the greens were completely wilted. Then I found the small date sticker on the package and they are selling sandwiches that have a date from 2 days ago for 13 bucks! Wtf?!? Why would they keep selling these? Gross",0,0,1,1,1
"Sun Devil Dining on Lemon Street has probably been the worst dining experience I have ever had. Day after day, they run out of pretty much everything half way through the day, including probably the most popular item, grilled chicken. They don't even care to have the food prepared by 11am, which is the time they tell everyone the main food options will be available by. Along with many other students, I am sick and tired of shitty food and horrible service by the workers. Except for Ashley, she has always been happy and smiling. Everything about this dining hall has been awful and if there were a way for me to take my money back, and put that towards something else, preferably food that is edible, I would greatly appreciate it. Hopefully this will reach the eyes of someone in charge so they can change these ways and start making students happy. But until then, Keep up the shitty service.",0,1,0,3,3

"I usually wouldn't write a review about fried chicken chain restaurants, but they're ROTD worthy so maybe this is relevant. I'm usually under the impression that this is better than the other two large chains, but this particular location leaves me inclined to change my mind. Maybe their heat lamps are busted or something, because my food was not far beyond room temperature as well as dried out, with seasoning dumped on indiscriminately. 

I don't even have high expectations for a place like this, but it manages to give me the impression that no one there really gives a shit, and they coast on the franchise name alone. I will eat literally anything on this intersection except for this particular restaurant.",0,0,1,1,1
"First visit January 2014, 3pm. The store was clean, lots of staff moving around in the kitchen.
I ordered the single patty burger with everything and a small drink. Total was $4.95.

The burger was room temperature, the patty was dry and thin. What I think happens is the burger was cooked but all the condiments are cold, but the patty is so thin that it drops in temperature rapidly when they wrap it in paper. When it arrives at the table the burger is slightly warmer than room temperature.
While I was eating someone in a uniform walked up to me to ask if my sandwich was okay. I had a mouthful of food at the time, which is an odd time to go interrupt someone. I wanted to ask if they could nuke my burger but by then I just wanted to leave.

"I usually love Popeye's!! But this location ruined it for me!!!!! They deserve a negative star rating! Im Mad i had to give them 1 star!! Got basic 5 piece chicken strip meal with red beans an rice ( which was dry & nasty ) an wasnt even half of the cup filled. The chicken after only 1 bite tasted like it sat under the warming light for days it was hard. Portions were horriable!! My wife's meal was fish an shrimp. Her shrimp was like rubber an she couldn't bite thru her fish. Truly one of my worst experiences with food. And thats saying alot, Been around the world twice an ate in many different countries. The only thing that was good was the strawberry fanta. An thats because they didnt have anything to do with it!!!    Dont think i'll ever eat Popeye's again.",1,0,0,1,2
"The food was fine, the issue is with the soda dispenser. The ice cubes are literally dirty, you can see the dirt inside the ice. After complaining to management, I got a refund for my food, but then refused to bring me the food I ordered. I would not come here again.",0,1,0,3,3
"Let me preface this by saying I was a ""sandwich artist"" once.  

I ordered a meatball sub and typically they ask what kind of cheese you would like first so it can save the bread from the sauce so it doesn't get all soggy.  The lady didn't do it in this order AND put the meatballs right at the weakest part of the open bread - right in the middle.  Needless to say, when I got home 5 minutes later, the food was still hot but the sandwich was a sloppy mess.  I lost meatballs left and right and eventually just ate with a fork.

Stopped in to have lunch with a friend ordered a #1 meal upgraded to onion rings only to find out ranch dipping sauce was an extra charge!!! WTH??? REALLY??? I did pay an additional $.35 for upgrade to onion rings...also barbeque dipping sauce is extra too...why not make all the condiments extra charge if that is the case???

"I've been to this Marisco place several times, and I've passed the absurdly loud music since the food I've been served has been decent. On today's occasion. My Aguachiles (the red kind) not only smelled rancid it also tasted like it. My husband was in need of a new refreshment and it took 15 mins. For someone to pass by (not our waitress who was too busy flirting with the band members at the bar) for us to ask for a refill. Needless to say, I did not finish my Aguachiles and now I'm kind of scared of getting some sort of infection later tonight for eating some of that rancid raw shrimp. I would not be coming here again since  this goes beyond a bad waitress, if they are serving rancid raw food here I can only imagine. Also the bathroom do not have stalls, the ""door"" is a shower curtain! Nope, will not be coming here! PEOPLE BEWARE!!",1,0,0,2,2

This Carls Jr is the worst after 8pm. I mean you're guys are open until 1:30 am. I didn't get any service at the drive thru at like 12:30am. Staff is not the friendliest. I know it's just fast food but that just ridiculous. It happened more than once!,0,1,0,3,3
"I stopped at this location of Carls Jr. for thr Baby-Back Rib Burger, but unfortunately I was told they no longer make them. So, I settled for their signature Famous Star Burger w/cheese combo.

What I received for my 6 bucks and change was a smashed up, mayo filled mess that they threw together... I ordered super heavy pickles, and they gave me three. Needless to say, the burger was a sloppy, disgusting, mayo globbed disaster. The only positive thing here was the fries, they were hot

My normal experience ar Carls Jr. is much more pleasant than this, it's this particular location that is the problem. The building is old and outdated, and the employees here seem like they just dont care.

Ordered a meatball sub. Guy dug out all the sauce from the bottom of the container along with one meatball. I had to tell him it was the worse looking sandwich I'd ever seen. He asked if I wanted more meatballs. Yeah! More than one on a sandwich would be nice. He found another container fresh with more meatballs and place a couple on the bread. I also ordered a steak and cheese sub toasted. Got back to my office 3 minutes away and the meat ball sub bread was a mess. My steak and cheese wasn't even hot enough to melt the cheese.  Terrible. Last time there for me.,1,0,0,1,2
"When I started working here, I was pretty lazy about bringing lunch, and the cafeteria food was decent enough to keep eating. Nothing really sucks, tastewise; I'll get a philly or Rueben as a guilty pleasure. However since bringing my lunch more consistently to save money, I've noticed something any time I eat the cafe food. I'll feel super bloated and lethargic and gross, almost guaranteed. Morning: feels great, After lunch: shirt doesn't fit. It seems pretty 20th century not to have a variety of healthy lunch options (not just a chicken sandwich or salad or 8$ fish). I'm thankful for this realization; as I'll think twice before getting the fried option now.",0,1,0,3,3

My husband got the roast beef sandwich, it was not fresh... At all, bland, soggy. Bleh!

I got the Simple Salad... You would think 6 ingredients would be easy to execute, however the carrots were slimy and mushy... Basically on the way to rotten. Everything else in the salad was fine but I opted to use the balsamic dressing from Humble Pie as the creamy white dressing included didn't look like the ""red wine vinaigrette"" that was supposed to be in the salad kit.

However, the fellow sitting in the booth next to my family was high on something and kept picking at his open sores on his arm, leaving bloodied napkins all over the table next to his Circle K Big Gulp cup.

"This is by far the worst experience in any fast food establishment, EVER!  First of all, instead of ordering 3 of the bacon egg and cheese biscuits, I decided to upgrade and pay extra for the mile high bacon egg and cheese because it looked so good in the picture.  There was a paper thin amount of eggs on every sandwich instead of the hearty amount illustrated on the menu.  It looked nothing like the picture.  I know there is a shortage in eggs across the country, either charge more or make the customer aware.  Charging me the same price and not putting eggs on my sandwich isn't right.  Not really a big deal, so my order got messed up, I'm sure it's just a misunderstanding, so I call down to the restaurant to complain and the phone just rings and rings for over 10 minutes.  Finally somebody picks up and hangs up right away, I guess they got tired of listening to the phone ring. So I call right back.  I tell the girl that answers that I want to talk to a manager, she tells me that the manager isn't there and that I need to call back in 10 minutes.  I ask for the manager's name and the respondent tells me that she isn't going to give me that information.  I ask for her name and she tells me that she isn't going to give me that information either, then she proceeds to tell, not ask, me to call back in 10 minutes and she hangs up on me.  I only ask for names so I know who I'm talking to and who I'm looking to speak with; I didn't know it was a conspiracy.  If first names are so secret, why do they make them wear name tags??  Called back 10 minutes later and was told that the manager is off and wont be in until Monday.  I guess I'll just keep my complaints to myself.",0,1,0,3,3

My boyfriend and i proceeded cautiously and then the ROACH WAS BACK!!!!! at this point we got so mad that we decided to get everything from the table that hadnt been touched by the roach and we moved ourselves to a table in the middle of the establishment away from the walls.

"Food is fine...standard CFA. Service is weak. The GM, David, doesn't impress me. My order was messed up during the grand opening. I didn't notice until I got home when we opened the food to eat. I called to let them know, not that I cared about the $.30 price differential that erred in their favor, but about the principle. If I have to pay for cheese, I at least want to get the cheese, or whatever the case is. I was stuck between two people on hold, and David, the GM, came on but had put me on another hold. I had stuff going on and had to go. He called back, and apologized for the inconvenience and offered to send me a gift card. I didn't want to have them hassle with sending me a gift card, I just wanted (since he called back) to adjust my meal on the next visit to compensate for the error the first time. He says come in next time I am here, ask to talk to David, and he will make it right and comp the meal. Okay great. 

I come in a few weeks later, tell my story to the order taker lady, get a look like I'm crazy, and the lady I talk to goes and talks to David, in front of me. I place my order, told the story, and then there was an awkward wait while the lady talked to the GM. I don't like feeling awkward so I said don't even worry about it, all I originally wanted was to get this $.30 cheese taken care of, and the person taking my order couldn't figure out how to do that. So I said don't worry about it, just let me pay the full price and be done with it. Well I could hear and see David and the other lady talking, again like I was crazy. I told the lady I can tell David himself the story since he was right there getting it second hand now from this other lady. He clearly didn't remember by her telling the story what had happened and what he had told me. Finally I got to pay and be done. Food came out. It was fine, but they still got the order wrong (I ordered no pickles, twice in fact since they had to redo my order).  

I came out of my way to visit this place again. I hate being wronged, calling them on it, and feeling like I'm the bad guy by their actions and the way they handled this situation. All over $.30 cents that I originally didn't even care about, other than wanting to let them know and maybe get the cheese comped the next time since I paid for it once and never got it. 

If the GM tells me to drop his name, ask to talk to him so he can deliver on righting the situation, I expect that. If I follow up, and then I'm the bad guy for doing what he says, well that's not how customer service works. Canes is right down the road, and there's another CFA I will drive a little further to go to.",0,1,0,3,3

Every order had something wrong including the people that had ordered even before I got into the place. The women in front of me ordered a 2 piece meal and a 3 piece meal, after realizing that they had charged her for 2 - 3 piece meals she proceeded to go back to the front of the line to tell them about their mistake. They refunded her money and put in a new order for her. During that time a young man behind the counter filled the incorrect order and there it sat. For about 40 minutes. I stood there watching all the previous people continuing to go back for corrections when the manager asked what the order was and who the order there was for. The young man who had filled the order said I don't know who's order it is. They all stood around looking at each other for about 5 minutes before I walked up to the counter and said, I can tell you exacty who's order it is... I proceeded to explain that  it was the order that they had messed up. So they fixed her order and out  she went.

"So I've never been to Popeyes before, my cousin is always going to the one on baseline and is hooked. After seeing it so many times on her snapchat, I decided to give it a try. We prefer a #3 and four #5's, the price was reasonable. The lady says it'll be a 20 minute wait, so she parks us on the side. We wait 30minutes, and the chicken was fresh but isn't it common sense if your going to make me wait for chicken you should give me fresh frys and biscuits and mac n cheese? It was all old and dry! Chicken was good but I couldn't enjoy my whole meal. My cousin tells me it's probably just the location, at baseline they always make it fresh! We're a big family so we order a lot. On top of that, the lady forgot to give us forks, napkins, dipping sauce we asked for, and we had a missing drink! The two dr peppers we had were flat, and my other cousin ate her mac n cheese with her hands. I will give Popeyes another chance but never this one! It's probably the worst one in the valley! The thing that sucks the most is im on a strict diet and that was my cheat day, cheat day wasted! I'm not happy..",0,0,1,1,1
"Total garbage. Its irritating that they have absolutely no problem taking advantage of the hard working Boeing employees. Mostly fried bar food, and anything that isn't unhealthy shit is ridiculously expensive. I made the mistake of getting 3 sausages (plain with mustard), a banana, and a diet coke. Any guesses on cost? About $19. Wow. Same with breakfast. 3 eggs? About $2.10. Not too bad. Throw some tomatoes and onions on? Now it's a $4 veggie omelette. Seriously, fuck this place. Boeing needs to fire Aramark.

"Late after a night out, decided to get food from here. Had a coupon for a mile high bacon cheeseburger, which they don't have on their menu anymore, um, just got this coupon a week ago. They gave me the new menu item that replaced it, asked for extra crispy bacon. Got home and guess what, almost raw bacon, a burger on a pretzel bun, um, not what I wanted, you would think a change in bun would warrant telling me that. Also ordered onion rings, never again, all batter and undercooked, threw them away. Criss cut fries were subpar, but the chicken tenders my husband got were delicious. $20 to only eat $5 of the meal, I feel like Carl's Jr owes me money, you do realize you're competing with other fast food companies, oh maybe that's why you will never be on the top.

"THE WORST!! NEGATIVE RATING! This was the worst experience I have ever had with Popeyes Chicken & Biscuits.

They said it would take an extra 5 minutes. After parking and waiting 40 minutes, I went inside and asked about my order. There were no customers inside and when I approached the counter, I received no greeting. A slow approaching greasy looking young man approached, said nothing and just nodded as if to say ""what?"". I informed him I had been waiting and asked how much longer it would be. He yelled around the corner to ask about my order, and then came the fire works! A young lady yelled back, ""we didn't make it! He is new Israel, and you are not helping us! You need to help us!""  ( I guess a new person was being trained and the staff was too busy ) Israel then walked around the kitchen, and opened then leaned into the walk-in, grabbing some fish or chicken fingers by his hands and tossing it at the fryer. He never said a word to me--just walked around in a stuper like a zombie. He stood near the back behind the main food prep table barking out orders for more mashed, beans etc. I stood there for about another 5-6 minutes thinking my food was on its way. Then, unprofessional Israel approaches the counter slowly and tells me, ""they didn't make it yet, it will be another 5 minutes or you can have your money back"" It was unbelievable the lack of professionalism I witnessed.

Also wanted onion rings as a side, but this location apparently doesn't do onion rings. When he got the order home, there were two boxes of 2-piece dark meat. Went back to get the order re-done. He was asked if he wanted the original incorrect order because they would just throw it out anyway.  He said Yes, thank you. Good thing he did 'cause  when he got home we found the ONLY part of the order they replaced was the 3-piece white meat spicy.  If he hadn't brought home the original incorrect order, we would have ended up with only three pieces of spicy chicken. Of course, by the time he got back home, everything in the original incorrect order was stone-cold. OH! And they had mixed spicy dark in with the mild dark. Not worth a 3rd trip to try to get it right.  Won't be going back there, again.",0,0,1,1,1
"1. Employees are often rude and unprofessional when greeted at POS stations, they will often not respond to ""how are you?"" and will often just blankly stare at you. 
2. While all Barrett Honors Dining Hall Aramark employees are professional acting and fluent English speakers, whereas other dining halls this is not the case for the employees? The language barrier is a health and safety concern as allergens cannot be properly conveyed when requested.
3. Employees working at food stations tend to stand in back of station, acting busy and avoiding eye contact with guests, to avoid having to retrieve their food. This is especially prominent at the grill stations. They act as though they are immune from any employer discipline for wrongdoing.
4. Employees scuff when asked for an entre at a food station. Often will not say anything after being told ""thank you"" and will toss plate at you under sneeze guard while staring at you.
5. Guests often do not of options at food stations such as tomatoes or lettuce on hamburgers, because they are not clearly displayed on glass and employees often close lids to obstruct view of those items.
6. Employees are often not in correct uniforms, sometimes wearing MLB caps. I have seen POD workers, and other Aramark employees not wearing identifying name badges.
7. I witnessed a POD employee drop a sleeve of unwrapped ICEE cups on ground and then proceed to refill the cup dispenser with those contaminated cups.
8. I have received dirty, coated beverage cups from the ""clean"" cup racks, this is a health and safety concern and is often a warning sign that dishes are not being properly sanitized.
9. The soda fountains do not have ice machines for some reason and on a daily bias run out of ice, and sometime are just completely out of operation. Nearly every day I need to select my third or fourth choice of drink simply because only water comes out, meaning the BIB (bag in box) needs to be changed.
10. There are often no utensils necessary to eat a meal available to guests, they are only put out in limited batches and I have been dining where there wasn't a single one for in the entire dining establishment. There are no utensils at grill station.
11. Menus posted to sneeze guards often contain unavailable or had never been available items.
12. Sun Devil Dining and Aramark seem to cater to the ""vegan"" crowd, while removing food options for other guests, most likely because transitioning to this type of food is cheaper than serving traditional food, but at the same costs to all guests? 
13. The single limited condiment station is out of sauces on an hourly basis, I once notified an employee there was no condiments to which she assured me ""Yes, yes, I get someone"". After waiting for 10 minutes no employee had come to correct the issue.
14. Employees often seem to be sent on break during key operational periods (lunch/dinner ""rush"") and will be seen lounging around on cell phones while stations will often form extremely long lines.
15.  Consistently there are several employees on ""cleaning duty"" simply wiping down tables when long lines at food stations, but somehow the dining hall is consistently in unclean condition.
16. Guests often complete the surveys asking what they would like to see improved but Sun Devil Dining / Aramark have not acted on a single one of these suggestions.
Overall, the dining experience with Sun Devil Dining / Aramark has been the worst ever seen on any university or institution campus, and it seems to stem from the employee/company culture of ""we have your money, what are you going to do about it?"" 
Immediate change is needed or will result in sharing of these findings to prospective students, and if deemed necessary local and state health and safety organizations.

"Let's have a serious talk about airport food.  

Let me start by saying--Nocawich is NOT an example of the expected lackluster airport food that we all know and love.  Their sandwiches are oh so delicious.  The staff has always been friendly enough when I've bought stuff from there.  I love the Cashew Blackberry Jelly sandwiches (CB&J) to the point where I've decided I should probably re-think my PB&Js that I eat at home.  The ham and cheese with the spicy mustard is incredible, and one of my favorite airport sandwiches ever.

So, why one star?  The freaking price of a sandwich.  Their prices are so bad, it's infuriating on principle.  There's no way that ANYONE should be giving this restaurant good reviews due to their prices.  Where the hell are we, on the moon?  You know how you can tell when your sandwiches are overpriced?  When someone walks in with an expense account, gets a 15% airport discount, and when they look at what $19 bought them, they can't believe it.  You know that you've lost your market when business travelers with expense accounts won't buy your product on principle of cost.

The CB&J sandwich that I mentioned earlier is $6.00, which is pretty outrageous, especially for the size of the sandwich that you get.  However, it's probably one of the better values on the menu.  

And even the consistency of their pricing is way off!  Nocawich has two locations in PHX Terminal 4.  In their full service location, the cost of the previously referenced delicious ham and cheese sandwich is $9.99.  This is ABSURD.  The icing on the cake is this, though:  The exact same ham and cheese sandwich, with the same condiments, wrapped in the exact same wrapping, on the same bread, simply out of a different freezer about 150' away is $10.50.  So, you can save .51 for walking 150'.  I forget the exact cost of the CB&J at the Nocawich express location, but it's certainly not less.  Might as well walk the 150' for them to make you a fresh one!

The sandwiches are delicious, but I just can't recommend it, and this is frustrating because this would be one of my airport staples if only the pricing was realistic.  The PHX Skyharbor airport is LOADED with really good places to eat (And the so is the city!). There's literally no good reason to come here over another restaurant for these prices.

"This place is more like Italian Grosso. Judging by the huge number of negative reviews, I'm not the only person who experienced Gary the Sociopath. I was in town on March 13, 2015 for spring training with some friends and it was a Saturday night. Every restaurant was busy so I stopped into this place to ask if they had any availability. I was talking to a nice young woman when a greasy haired man with erratic behavior (who I discovered later was the owner, Gary) interrupted and said ""No, there's nothing."" I asked if he could recommend any other place. He answered, ""You won't get in anywhere, I recommend nothing. Everything is full."" Perturbed at this odd response, I said, ""So are you saying we should leave Scottsdale?"" Gary suddenly flew into a rage and asked me if I was f---ing with him. He yelled, ""I gave you a good answer and that's what you ask?"" He then stalked off. 

Shocked, I asked the young woman who that crazy person was and when she answered, ""my father,"" I felt such pity for her.

"We had my daughter's birthday party here. The price was $200 for 4 pizzas and tokens for the kids. We had booked a 10AM time which is the time they open. They opened about 2 minutes late and then when we get in they didn't have our table setup. 2 other parties where there who had theirs. Apparently the girl who was supposed to host our party called in but then no one took over for her to set us up. So we got setup about 15 minutes past 10:00. 

Then they come out and tell us the oven is not working so we may not get pizza! Ok crap happens and I get it but they offered no solution. No real manger was in so no one can tell me any alternative or if I would get a discount. By the time the manger got in and came to see me one of the other parties gave up and left. I was about to cancel the pizza because of how late it already was (11:25) and are party ended in just over 30 mins. 

They ended up comping 50% of my bill and giving us some free tokens and a pass to come back for dinner and drinks plus more tokens another night. I feel they made up for it but it should have been handled sooner and better. The problem with the oven was the gas was messed up and the gas company had to come out and fix it. I don't blame them for the problem, but I do blame them for the lack of a resolution sooner. The staff was courteous and did the best they could given the circumstances but I probably would not do another birthday party there.",0,1,0,1,3
"This is the worst pizza! Crust like cardboard, skimpy amount of pepperoni, overloaded with bad cheese. Even at a $5 lunch special they are ripping off the trades people working in N. Scottsdale with no other options. Shameful",1,0,0,3,2
"Ordered at 6p for delivery to my hotel. Estimated 50 minutes to deliver and the driver was there in just about that time, problem is he had the wrong pizza. 

He was very apologetic and took it back and said he would be back as quick as he could. It took him roughly an hour and ten minutes to return. Not exactly how I would handle a mistake that is 100% their fault. 

Mind you 1/2 my food was left behind so dinner was split. 

Now on to the pizza, it was ok, I guess.  The thin crust was  good, sauce was heavy and inconsistent, cheese was good. I did not like the spices on top after cooking. Just my personal preference. 

Price was high. $29 (including tip) for 14"" cheese pizza, French fries (they were ok for delivery), and a 2L Coke.

"Showed up with 2 girlfriends for the last UFC fights. Walked in and sat at the table our friend was waiting. Punk manager immediately came over and told us we couldn't stay..the place was full....ummmm... no it's not. Finally convinced we were staying and with our friends. We  ordered some mediocre food. When the fights were over there was still a group of people waiting to get in and my friend asked how come the other people were not being allowed in. The manager then yelled and started pointing his finger in my friends face and said he had been more than accommodating, completely lost his cool ranting and raving and we were now being kicked out. This was completely unprovoked and it is obvious he has a screw loose. We of course left with our friends and several others got up and walked out.

Have been here before and loved it but it was a far different experience tonight. I made reservations in person five days in advance because I couldn't get through on the phone. To my surprise when  we arrived (party of 12) there was no reservation.  We finally arranged for a table but we're told it had to be on one card. Then we were told we could use no more than three cards.  The meals were ordered but came luke warm and most people got the wrong orders or only partial orders.  I could not believe how much the restaurant had gone downhill since our slat visit.,1,0,0,2,2
"As a regular wingstop customer from Texas, I WAS thrilled to find a wingstop.  This was the worst excuse for a wingstop franchise I have ever visited.  Wings tasted old, the Louisiana rub was watered down, yes it is supposed to be a dry rub, the mild sauce was also watered down.  No flavor.  Tried to call but no answer.  Would love to here from the franchise owner. The location is on Baseline by Frys. Threw away $20 at wingstop so I went to Sonic.  Horrible wingstop location!!!",1,0,0,3,2

Five minutes later I was still waiting, we asked again; it took another five minutes to get. Our bill was $51, we gave Francisco $100; he explained he had to break the bill as he did not have that much money. I left to purchase something and returned about 15 minutes later.

"I don't give too many 2 star reviews. Mainly because I know this stuff effects people's lives and livelihood and also, having run a food service establishment, i realize we could have come on an off night, but other than the fact that everyone had a great attitude our evening at Arriba was sub-par.

They sat us in a closing section so we had to move seats after a couple minutes of getting settled. Once in our new seats, we waited...and waited for our server. Unfortunately I didn't time it to give a subjective view, but I was trying not to influence my wife's opinion. Once the order was taken it took way too long for my Margarita, which was horrible. The food was OK, but service (saying hello, getting drinks, refills, checking up on us) is the easiest piece and they failed.

Immidiately we asked for drinks it's only hot in Phoenix even at nine a clock at night it's still 100 degrees out.

Another large family came in right after us and were also turned away. Another family was getting out of their car and was going to go in and we told them that we were all just turned away. I'm rough guessing that you lost approximately $150+ in sales due to the cashier turning your customers away. I'm just wondering if the owner of this location is aware that they are losing LOTS of money due to their staff turning people away before they close.

Other than taking our order, she stopped back one other time, we asked for an additional condiment, and it took several more minutes before she meandered back to us.

Draft Beer Selection: Not great either. For a ""Mexican Grill"" (using the term loosely) I guess I expected a few more choices.

"I hate for my first review to be of this joke of a place.  We have given this place a million tries, and somehow they go from sub par to how-in-the-hell can a place be so mismanaged? Seriously! The bartenders and servers are exempt from this, they are usually right on the ball.  However what kind of complete idiots do they have for managers!?! Wow! We have dumped tons of money into this place (only because it is our only nearby option for football) and get a shitty beer selection, maybe one cider option, and overpriced under poured drinks, and smaller and worse quality food.  Which sadly, we tolerated. 
     But today took the cake.  We arrived before anyone on a Sunday (again, for football) and got ourselves a nice table. Again...like...at 930am.  After enjoying ourselves and watching the game for a few hours they plop a f*n reserved sign on our table and tell us to move. Are you F****** KIDDING ME!!! I had no problem if they said at 930am, oh hey this table needs to be clear at one, you may want to pick another.  BUT OH HELL NO they are not bright enough to provide even the smallest of a heads up until they kicked us out of our table.  And if you know this place on Sundays there is not another table to move to, its packed for NFL.  And the damn kicker? The reserved table we were currently were spending money at sat empty for 2 hours lol! (we know this as we literally stood around bar to finish watching games) So great move Sandbar! Kick paying customers out to make room for no one! haha and our neighbors at the table next to us (with a tab much higher than ours) had the same BS happen to them and were replaced by water drinkers!! The GM Justin was a joke.  Wake up buddy and learn some customer service.  Pretty sure your servers could run that place better.

"I'll start off by saying that this was my favorite place to eat when I lived near Downtown Phx. It has been a few months since our last visit and today we decided to go back so that we could take my cousin and her boyfriend to our fave spot.  My husband and I were excited taste their yummy wings.  However, that excitement quickly became a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT!! 

Let me start off by saying that the waitress and food from today really sucked!  First, we ordered drinks and they took forever to come back even though the restaurant was nearly empty.  Then, we ordered wings, the chicken tenderloins, and a burger w/ fries. These didn't take that long but when they came out I thought that something was off. The wings were served in a silver bowl where the wings are tossed, which I have NEVER EVER seen done in my visits to this place. No presentation, everything was just blah.... I went ahead and tried them expecting great taste as always but INSTEAD they tasted old and not cooked correctly. They had a very chewy consistency. We normally chow these down but based on how horrible they were my husband did NOT even eat!!  I left most of the wings as well!! And moving on to the tenderloins... I don't know what is going on at Steve's but whatever it is, it's not good!!! The tenderloins looked like they were popped out of a frozen bag and thrown into the fryer. They were chewy and felt hard on the outside! Nothing fresh about them, PLUS THEY TASTED LIKE FISH completely gross!!! Someone is using oil to fry fish and then using it to fry other foods which is totally disgusting!!!!!  The fries that came with the burger tasted just like FISH as well! All of it just totally killed my appetite and we did not even say anything to the waitress because we wanted to get out of there and not make a scene.

I will NOT GO BACK AT ALL!!  I was so disappointed by my experience at Steve's today. I don't know who the person is that is in charge is right now but all I can say is that they're doing a horrible job and killing this place!  In my past visits, the owner: an anglo, short chubby lady with short blonde hair was there and the restaurant was doing well but now it just seems to have GONE TO THE DUMPS!! I wasted my money today but that is ok, at least now I know not to go back and to tell others not to waste their money at this place.",0,1,0,3,3

No, the menu doesn't state fried so redundantly.  Taking the blame for our unhealthy choices, I still have to say this is the worst food I've ever had in the Phoenix area. We were raking our brains trying to come up with any other place that was even close to this bad, and couldn't come up with anything to compare it to.  My boyfriend's comment, ""how can you screw up fries?""  The only plus was that our waitress was quick, and nice.
